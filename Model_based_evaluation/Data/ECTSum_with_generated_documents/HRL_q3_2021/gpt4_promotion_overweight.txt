**Investment Promotion Report: Hormel Foods Corporation**

**Executive Summary:**
Hormel Foods Corporation (NYSE: HRL), a renowned leader in the food industry, showcased a stellar financial performance in the third quarter, underscoring its resilience and strategic acumen amidst a challenging landscape marked by inflationary pressures and industry-wide supply chain disruptions. This report delineates the strategic initiatives and financial outcomes that reinforce our recommendation for an 'overweight' investment stance on Hormel Foods.

**1. Record-Breaking Financial Performance:**
In the third quarter, Hormel achieved the highest quarterly sales in its 130-year history, amounting to $2.9 billion, reflecting a 20% increase year-over-year. This growth transcends the challenges of the current economic environment and is a testament to Hormel's robust business model and diverse product portfolio. Notably, organic sales grew by 14%, while the integration of the recently acquired Planters snacks nut business seamlessly contributed to the company's expanded market reach.

**2. Strategic Acquisitions and Portfolio Diversification:**
The acquisition of the Planters brand is a strategic enhancement to Hormel's product lineup. Planters, a prominent name in the snack industry, dovetails with Hormel’s growth objectives and reinforces its presence in the snacking segment. This acquisition, among others such as Sadler's Smokehouse and expansions in plant-based offerings, is pivotal for Hormel’s long-term growth trajectory.

**3. Innovation and Market Adaptation:**
Hormel continues to invest in innovation, notably expanding its plant-based and prepared foods offerings. The launch of plant-based pepperoni and sausage products, and the investment in a new Columbus charcuterie plant, cater to evolving consumer preferences and demonstrate Hormel's commitment to meeting diverse consumer needs across various demographics and geographies.

**4. Strong Segment Performance Across the Board:**
All segments reported robust growth, with particularly notable performance in the international markets (up 36% compared to 2020) and foodservice (up 45% compared to the prior year), underscoring Hormel's effectiveness in capitalizing on post-pandemic recovery in the foodservice domain. The Retail and Deli segments also exhibited impressive growth, bolstered by sustained consumer demand.

**5. Effective Management of Inflationary Pressures:**
Despite facing significant input cost inflation, particularly in pork and packaging materials, Hormel has adeptly managed these pressures through strategic pricing actions across nearly every brand, which will likely cushion future margins and profitability. The quarter’s adjusted earnings per share rose by 5% year-over-year to $0.39, excluding one-time acquisition costs, indicative of effective cost management and operational efficiency.

**6. Strong Financial and Capital Position:**
With the issuance of $2.3 billion notes and maintaining a disciplined capital allocation strategy, Hormel sustains a solid financial foundation. The company targets a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.5 to 2 times over the next few years, underscoring a commitment to maintaining financial flexibility and supporting sustained growth and dividend payments.

**Recommendation:**
Based on Hormel Foods Corporation's robust quarterly performance, strategic acquisitions, innovative portfolio expansion, and effective management of current market challenges, we recommend an 'overweight' stance for investors. Hormel’s forward-looking strategies and resilient financial position poise it for continued success, making it a compelling choice for investors seeking growth in the consumer staples sector.
