### **Conclusion:**
Given the mixed recovery signals across different regions, lingering uncertainties around the pandemic, and varying recovery rates in key travel segments, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended.

Investors should monitor upcoming quarters closely for more consistent signs of comprehensive recovery across all sectors and geographies before adjusting this stance.
