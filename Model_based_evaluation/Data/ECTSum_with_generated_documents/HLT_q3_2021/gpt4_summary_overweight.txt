5. **Development Pipeline:**
   - The development pipeline grew to 404,000 rooms, highlighting aggressive expansion, particularly in high-growth markets like China and the Asia Pacific. This includes significant opportunities both from new developments and conversion of existing properties.

**Operational Performance:**
- Strong leisure demand has been the main driver of recovery, with leisure rates now exceeding 2019 levels. Business travel is also picking up, as evident from the increased midweek occupancy and improving rates.

**Strategic Initiatives:**

- **Technology and Loyalty Programs:** Enhancements such as Digital Key Share and automatic room upgrades for Honors members emphasize improving customer experience and engagement.

**Investment Outlook:**
The continued positive trajectory in key financial metrics, combined with aggressive geographical and segment expansion, supports an 'overweight' investment stance. The company's ability to adapt strategically to post-pandemic travel trends, cost control proficiency, and robust growth in high-demand regions presents a promising outlook for sustained growth and profitability. We recommend a strong buy based on these fundamentals and visible recovery paths.
