   - Meals & Beverages showed a 6% decrease in organic net sales versus the prior year but reported a 9% increase over two years, reflective of a strong consumer base.
   - Snacks experienced a 1% decrease in organic net sales, although key brands like Goldfish and Pepperidge Farm cookies continue to show robust performance.

6. **Future Outlook and Strategy:**
   - The management maintains a positive outlook for the fiscal year 2022 with a full year guidance expecting net sales between a 1% decline to a flat growth, and adjusted EBIT to range from a decrease of 4.5% to 1.5%.
   - Forward strategies involve further scaling of inflation mitigation actions, enhancing labor conditions to stabilize production and inventory levels, and a strong focus on consumer retention and brand strength through targeted marketing and product innovation.
