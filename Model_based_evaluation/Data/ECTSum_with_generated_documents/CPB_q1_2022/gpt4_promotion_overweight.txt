2. **Effective Pricing and Inflation Mitigation Strategies:**

4. **Innovative and Strategic Market Positioning:**
   - CSC is actively innovating within its product lines as seen in the Snacks segment – Goldfish crackers demonstrated strong consumption growth, backed by impactful marketing and new flavor introductions.
   - The company's focus on the younger demographic is strategic, tapping into a growing consumer base that could drive long-term loyalty and consumption.

5. **Fiscal Guidance and Outlook:**
   - CSC maintains a cautiously optimistic guidance for FY 2022, anticipating a return to topline growth and margin improvements in the latter half of the year.
   - With inflation mitigation strategies and the second wave of pricing adjustments, CSC expects a steady recovery in margins and earnings as it progresses through the fiscal year.

**Potential Risks and Considerations:**
