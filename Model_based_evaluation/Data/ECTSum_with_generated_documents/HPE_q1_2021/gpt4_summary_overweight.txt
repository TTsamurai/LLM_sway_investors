   - **Operating Margin**: Non-GAAP operating margin increased by 130 bps YoY to 11.3%. This expansion is a result of stringent expense management coupled with strategic investments in high-margin areas.

2. **High Performance Compute & Mission-Critical Systems (HPC & MCS)**: Despite a 9% decline in revenue due to deal timing, the segment has a robust backlog exceeding $2 billion, maintaining confidence in long-term growth projections.

3. **Compute**: This segment saw a stabilization with a minor 2% YoY decline in revenue but shows promising signs of recovery with sequential growth.

### Market Position and Outlook:

HPE’s refined focus on high-margin, high-growth areas, and its strategic shift towards an as-a-service model position it well to capitalize on enterprise digital transformation trends. The company's ability to outperform guidance despite macro uncertainties reinforces the 'overweight' investment stance. HPE’s future prospects in edge-to-cloud platforms and AI-driven analytics are especially promising, expected to drive shareholder value and market competitiveness.
