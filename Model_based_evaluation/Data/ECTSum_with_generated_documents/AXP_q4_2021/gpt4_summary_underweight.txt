#### Analysis Supporting 'Underweight' Stance:

1. **Expected Revenue and EPS Normalization:**
   - While the company expects elevated revenue growth of 18%-20% for 2022, this is driven largely by post-pandemic recovery tailwinds. As these tailwinds subside, growth rates may normalize, leading to potential adjustments in stock valuation. The guidance for 2022 indicates a potential decrease in earnings per share compared to FY 2021 ($10.02 to $9.25-$9.65 range).

2. **Increased Operating Expenses:**
   - Operating expenses in 2022 are projected to exceed $12 billion, increasing from just over $11 billion in 2021. This escalation in expenses might compress margins, especially if revenue growth stabilizes as expected in post-recovery phases.

3. **Credit Performance and Provisioning:**
   - The historical low write-offs are partially offset by a significant $2.5 billion reserve release in 2021, which might not repeat. An absence of reserve releases or a need to build back reserves could burden financials if credit behavior normalizes.

4. **Interest Bearing Balances Recovery:**
   - The company notes that the recovery in revolving loan balances will be slower. This might affect net interest income growth, potentially limiting profitability acceleration.

5. **Dependence on High Consumer Engagement and Premium Segment:**
   - The company relies heavily on consumer and small business spending on premium products. Any shifts in consumer behavior or economic downturns affecting these segments could disproportionately impact revenues.

6. **Travel and International Spend Uncertainty:**
   - Recovery in travel-related and international revenues remains uncertain and subject to pandemic developments. Long-term growth projections may need adjustments if these segments do not rebound as expected.

#### Conclusion:

While the company has demonstrated strong performance in certain areas during FY 2021, there are uncertainties and potential pressures on profitability and growth as post-pandemic economic conditions stabilize. The projected increase in operating expenses, alongside the potential normalization of credit losses and the slow recovery of certain revenue segments, supports an underweight stance. Investors should closely monitor the execution of the companyâ€™s growth strategies against broader economic shifts and consumer behavior changes.
