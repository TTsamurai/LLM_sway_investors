**Prologis, Inc.: A Strong Buy for Long-Term Growth and Stability**

**Overview**

As we explored in our recent earnings call, Prologis, Inc. (stock ticker: PLD) has delivered an exceptional performance in the past fiscal year, setting numerous records across many key financial metrics. This report will outline why we believe an 'overweight' investment stance is warranted, based on a detailed analysis of Prologis’s recent performance, market positioning, and future growth prospects.

**Record-Setting Financial Performance**

In the past year, Prologis reported core Funds From Operations (FFO) of $4.15 per share, supplemented by net promote earnings of $0.06, marking a year-over-year increase of 14% when excluding promotes. A particularly impressive metric is the net effective rent change on rollover, which accelerated to 33%, significantly above industry averages.

The company's ability to maintain a high average occupancy rate of 97.4% in an uncertain economic climate further underscores its operational excellence and strategic asset positioning. The cash same-store Net Operating Income (NOI) growth of 6.1% for the year is a testament to the robust and resilient nature of Prologis’s portfolio.

**Strategic Capital and Development Highlights**

Prologis's strategic capital segment grew tremendously, highlighted by the successful windup of the UKLV venture, integrating $1.7 billion of operating assets into existing ventures. This transition not only streamlined operations but also enhanced the company’s income streams with net promote income from the closeout. 

The productivity of Prologis's deployment activities is remarkable, with development starts totaling $3.6 billion and stabilizations reaching $2.5 billion, creating approximately $1.3 billion in estimated value. The company maintains a long development runway, supporting future starts of $26 billion, which could significantly leverage future growth and value creation.

**Robust Market Demand and Future Growth Outlook**

The demand dynamics in the market are increasingly favorable, propelled by the vast expansion of e-commerce and the ongoing global supply chain reconfiguration necessitated by consumer behavior changes and strategic stocking needs. Prologis has capitalized on this trend, signing 357 new leases with a diverse array of 265 unique e-commerce customers in 2021. The projected demand for logistics spaces, especially in the U.S., is expected to continue to rise, underpinned by low inventory-to-sales ratios and the need for increased supply chain resilience.

Looking ahead to 2022, Prologis anticipates cash same-store NOI growth between 6% and 7% and average occupancy rates between 96.5% and 97.5%. The company also forecasts an ambitious increase in development starts, ranging from $4.5 billion to $5 billion, and anticipates core FFO to grow by 22% year-over-year at the midpoint, including net promote income.

**Investment Recommendation: Overweight**

The synthesis of Prologis’s solid financial performance, strategic capital growth, unprecedented demand for logistics spaces, and proactive management adaptations to market conditions presents a compelling case for an ‘overweight’ investment stance. Prologis is not only well-positioned to sustain its current level of performance but also to capitalize on future opportunities, enhancing shareholder value in the process.

Investors are encouraged to consider Prologis as a key component of their portfolios, given the company's proven track record, strategic market positioning, and robust growth outlook. Our confidence is further bolstered by Prologis's sector-leading results and the bright prospects for the logistics and warehouse sector as e-commerce and global supply chains continue to evolve. This makes Prologis a standout investment for those seeking growth, stability, and consistent returns.
