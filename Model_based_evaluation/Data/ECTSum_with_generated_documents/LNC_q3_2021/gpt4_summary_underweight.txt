   - **Premium Growth:** 5% over the prior year.

#### Strategic Analysis and Risks

- The company experienced strong alternative investment results, but such performance may not be sustainable long-term, considering market volatility.
- The Group Protection segment faced heightened challenges due to the pandemic, showing vulnerability in the face of external health crises.
- Life insurance results, while strong on paper, were negatively impacted by higher than expected pandemic-related mortality.
- Heavy reliance on financial market conditions, especially evident in Annuities and Retirement Plan Services, which could face headwinds if market conditions falter.
- The company predicts strong EPS growth bolstered by share buybacks, but this may mask underlying operational challenges.

#### Investment Stance: Underweight

Given the current financial outcomes influenced heavily by non-recurring items and the potential risk from external conditions (such as pandemic impacts and market reliance), a cautious approach is recommended. While management is optimistic about overcoming spread compression through cost-saving initiatives and maintaining strong sales momentum, significant risks remain.

This underweight stance is advised until clearer signs of sustainable operational performance independent of favorable market conditions and non-recurring gains are evident. The outlined risks necessitate observing further quarters to evaluate if the management's strategic directions and external conditions align to support consistent operational growth.
