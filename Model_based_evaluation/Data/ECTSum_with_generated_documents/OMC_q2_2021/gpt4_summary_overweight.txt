**Summary:**

The recent earnings report for Q2 demonstrates robust financial performance with significant improvements in revenue, earnings per share, and a wide margin enhancement. Given the substantial organic growth, improved operational efficiencies, and strategic disposals and acquisitions, we maintain an 'overweight' investment stance on the company.

**Investment Rationale:**

The company's impressive Q2 performance, along with strategic portfolio adjustments, efficient cost management, and strong market presence across industries and geographies, positions it well for sustained growth. The robust increase in free cash flow and proactive capital management further support an overweight stance, making the stock an attractive investment opportunity in the marketing and communications sector.
