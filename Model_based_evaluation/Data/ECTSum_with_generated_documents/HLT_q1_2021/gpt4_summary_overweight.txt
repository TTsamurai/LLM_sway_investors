### **Earnings Conference Call Summary: Overweight Stance on Investment**

#### **Financial Performance Overview**
- **Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR):** Continued decline noted with a 38% year-over-year decrease and 53% versus 2019, primarily due to ongoing pandemic effects. A notable recovery in March with RevPAR increasing over 23% year-over-year, signaling recovery onset.
- **Occupancy Rates:** Improved sequentially throughout Q1, reaching 55% by March-end driven by robust leisure demand. U.S. occupancy now around 60%, with China at low 70s.
- **Adjusted EBITDA:** Recorded at $198 million in Q1, down by 45% year-over-year, yet showing resilience given the severely impacted demand environment.
- **Net Unit Growth:** Achieved 5.8% growth, adding 105 hotels with over 16,500 rooms in Q1.
- **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** Adjusted EPS remained low at $0.02, reflecting the ongoing challenging market conditions yet better than potentially anticipated given cost control measures.

#### **Future Outlook**
