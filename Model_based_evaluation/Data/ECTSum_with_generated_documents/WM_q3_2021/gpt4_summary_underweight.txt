### Summary Report: Earnings Conference Call - Underweight Investment Stance

**Company:** WM (Waste Management)

**Date:** October 26, 2021

**Overview:**
In the third quarter of 2021, WM experienced significant operational and financial hurdles primarily due to rampant inflation, labor shortages, and supply chain disruptions. Despite these challenges, the company managed to stay on track with its 2021 financial projections, indicating resilient operational capabilities. However, several areas of concern emerged during the quarter that warrant adopting an underweight investment stance.

**Key Financial Metrics and Insights:**

1. **Revenue and Volume Growth:**
   - The company reported higher-than-expected revenue growth driven by a 6.5% rise in yield and volume in the collection and disposal business, surpassing expectations with third-quarter collection and disposal volume up 3.8%.
   - Notably, commercial volume increased by 4.6%, and special waste volume surged by 16.6%.

2. **Operating EBITDA:**
   - Operating EBITDA increased by over 14%, reflecting strong operational performance amidst difficult market conditions.
   - The guidance for adjusted 2021 operating EBITDA is set between $5 billion and $5.1 billion, representing a significant increase from the previous year.

3. **Inflation and Cost Management:**
   - WM faced around $160 million in additional costs from labor inflation ($60 million) and other operating expenses ($100 million) during the quarter.
   - Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenue climbed by 180 basis points to 62.2%, highlighting increased pressures from inflationary factors.

4. **Capital Expenditure and Investment Delays:**
   - Total capital spending for the quarter stood at $464 million, with the first nine months accumulating to $1.13 billion. This rate is slower than planned, primarily due to ongoing supply chain constraints.
   - Planned investments, especially in recycling technology at MRFs (about $200 million for the year), are being pushed into 2022.

5. **Cash Flow and Shareholder Returns:**
   - Significantly, WM generated $773 million of free cash flow during the third quarter and $2.29 billion through September.
   - The company returned over $1.7 billion to shareholders, including $730 million in dividends and $1 billion in stock repurchases.

6. **Strategic Initiatives and Automation:**
   - WM is accelerating the automation of high turnover jobs and upgrading single-stream recycling plants to alleviate labor shortages and improve efficiency.
   - However, there is a concern regarding the timing and effectiveness of these automation projects in providing immediate relief from cost pressures.

**Risks and Concerns:**
- The continuous high inflation and labor costs could persist longer than anticipated, potentially eroding profitability margins despite strong pricing actions.
- Delays in capital spending due to supply chain issues may affect the timely realization of projected benefits from investments, particularly in essential technology upgradations.
- Although volume growth and high commodity prices have bolstered revenue, reliance on these factors can be risky if economic conditions shift adversely.

**Recommendation: Underweight Stance**
Given the escalating operating expenses, inflationary pressures, and delays in strategic capital deployments, it is advisable to adopt an 'underweight' stance on WM's stock. The potential for extended cost pressures and investment delays could impact short-term financial performance, thus raising concerns over the stock's outlook in the immediate future. Investors should closely monitor the companyâ€™s ability to manage costs and execute strategic investments effectively amidst ongoing economic challenges.
