4. **Net Income & EPS**: Despite adjustments for non-GAAP measures, both net income and EPS have shown resilience, benefiting from strong operational efficiency and strategic pricing adjustments.
5. **Capital Allocation**: Capital expenditures were $464 million in Q3, contributing to a total of $1.13 billion for the first nine months. Strategic investments focused on recycling infrastructure and technology enhancements signify a proactive capital investment stance.

### Strategic Operations and Growth Drivers:

- **Sustainability Initiatives**: WM continues to capitalize on the growing demand for sustainable solutions, evidenced by significant growth in the recycling and renewable energy sectors. Systematic upgrades to recycling facilities and the expansion in renewable energy offerings align with broader environmental goals and customer needs.
- **Labor & Supply Chain Management**: Despite facing labor and supply chain constraints, WM has effectively managed these challenges through proactive wage adjustments and operational shifts, ensuring service continuity and cost control.

### Investment Risks:
- **Inflationary Pressures**: Continuous monitoring of inflation impacts, particularly on labor and operational costs, remains crucial.
- **Supply Chain Disruptions**: Delays in capital projects due to supply chain disruptions could affect short-term operational efficiency and capital expenditure plans.
