### Key Financial Highlights from Recent Earnings Conference Call:

#### Overview and Strategic Highlights:
- **Strategic Consistency:** TransDigm remains committed to its consistent, long-standing strategy focused on intrinsic shareholder value creation, emphasizing operations in proprietary aerospace businesses with significant aftermarket content.
- **Sales Composition:** Roughly 90% of sales are from proprietary products, with a substantial portion being sole-source provider generated, concentrating primarily on aftermarket revenues which yield higher margins and provide stability during downturns.

#### Financial Performance and Metrics:
- **Q2 Revenue Breakdown:** The commercial market makes up about 65% of revenue with significant declines in commercial OEM revenue (down 43% in Q2 YOY), but slight sequential improvement in commercial aftermarket revenues (up 12% over Q1).
- **EBITDA Performance:** 'EBITDA as defined' was $519 million in Q2, down 23% compared to the previous year, with a margin of 43.5%. Despite challenges, there was a sequential margin improvement (~100 basis points), considering the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions.
- **Net Income and EPS:** Adjusted net income and EPS were not explicitly quantified in the summary but are critical in assessing financial health.
- **Free Cash Flow:** Posted $146 million in Q2, contributing to the expected $800 million for fiscal '21.
- **Acquisition and Divestitures:** Acquired Cobham Aero Connectivity for $965 million, and divested less proprietary defense businesses for approximately $240 million, which will positively impact liquidity with proceeds expected in Q3.

#### Market Performance and Outlook:
- **Commercial Aerospace Recovery:** Observing recovery signals, such as a 20% improvement in Q2 commercial OEM bookings compared to Q1, indicating slow OEM destocking and potential turnaround.
- **Defense Sector Performance:** Defense revenue grew 8% in Q2 YOY, with a strong order book, and anticipated continued expansion.
- **2021 Projections:** No formal fiscal 2021 guidance due to market uncertainties, though optimism persists with the gradual recovery of commercial OEM and aftermarket revenues in the first half of the fiscal year. Defense expected to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range for fiscal 2021.
- **Commercial Outlook:** The commercial aerospace market faces short-term challenges with potential longer-term recovery spurred by increased air traffic and easing of travel restrictions due to vaccine distributions.
  
#### Capital Structure and Liquidity:
- **Debt and Liquidity Management:** Net debt-to-LTM-EBITDA ratio stood at 8.2 times post-Cobham acquisition, peak expected, with gradual improvement as markets rebound.
- **Shareholder Returns:** Considering the current market and leverage levels, significant dividend payments or share buybacks are unlikely in the next three to four quarters.

#### Risk and Regulatory:
- **Tax and Regulatory Considerations:** Monitoring potential U.S. tax code changes under the new administration. The U.S. DoD IG audit ongoing, with outcomes anticipated in Q3 or Q4 of fiscal '21.

### Summary:
TransDigm's resilience in navigating the continuous challenges posed by the COVID-19 impact on the aerospace sector reflects strong strategic positioning and financial management. The company's focus on high-margin aftermarket products, strategic acquisitions, and careful cost management has allowed it to maintain robust EBITDA margins despite revenue fluctuations. Moving forward, TransDigm remains cautiously optimistic, underpinned by a potential rebound in air travel, a strong defense market, and strategic capital allocation aimed at long-term shareholder value creation.
