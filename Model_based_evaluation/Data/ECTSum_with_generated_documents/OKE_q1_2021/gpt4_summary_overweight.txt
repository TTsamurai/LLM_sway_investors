2. **Growth Drivers**: A look into region-specific details indicates that the Williston Basin's performance has been particularly strong, with notable mention of opportunities arising from a large inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells, which could continue to support volume without necessitating increased rig counts or investments.

Initiatives under consideration, like carbon capture and hydrogen storage, reflect a forward-thinking approach aligning with global energy transition trends.

#### **Conclusion & Outlook**

ONEOK's first quarter of 2021 paints a promising picture of sustained growth, prudent financial management, and strategic foresight. For investors, the combination of a solid financial performance, strategic asset optimization, and proactive adaptation to a changing energy sector makes ONEOK an attractive investment with substantial growth prospects.
