**ONEOK, Inc.: A Robust and Positioned Leader in Midstream Energy**

**Overview:**
Investors looking for strong growth potential combined with a disciplined strategy in the midstream energy sector should closely consider ONEOK, Inc. (OKE). As we review the company’s solid performance during the first quarter of 2021 and the robust outlook provided for the year, it becomes evident that ONEOK is well-poised for continued success and is worthy of an ‘overweight’ investment stance.

**Positive First Quarter Performance:**
In the first quarter of 2021, ONEOK showcased impressive financial results, underscoring its resilience amid challenging times. The company reported a 24% year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA, totaling $866 million. Net income reached $386 million, equivalent to $0.86 per share. The distributable cash flow saw a surge of 27%, exceeding $660 million. Not only has ONEOK managed this strong financial performance, but it also maintained a first-quarter dividend coverage of nearly 1.6 times, generating more than $245 million of distributable cash flow beyond dividends paid.

**Strategic Position Amidst Adversity:**
Despite the operational challenges posed by Winter Storm Uri, ONEOK’s strategic pre-emptive measures and agile response ensured continued operation with minimal disruptions. This circumstance turned into a testament to the company's robust infrastructure and commitment to reliability. Specifically, the natural gas pipeline and storage assets performed admirably, offering critical support to the demands of natural gas utilities and electric power plants during peak requirements.

**Earnings Growth and Increased Guidance:**
ONEOK’s base business continued to see growth, independent of fluctuating rig activity or commodity prices. Instead, the sustainable growth vectors for ONEOK are deeply integrated into its strategic assets across key operational areas, including the Williston Basin and increased ethane demand. Reflecting this strong strategic positioning and improved outlook based on first-quarter performance, ONEOK has confidently raised its financial guidance for 2021, expecting more than 17% growth in adjusted EBITDA compared to 2020. Additionally, the company has raised its net income and earnings per share guidance by 10%, anticipating a net income midpoint of $1.35 billion for the year.

**Capital Management and Future Opportunities:**
ONEOK remains committed to judicious capital management. Total capital expenditures for 2021 are maintained at a reduced level compared to the previous year, emphasizing efficiency and efficacy in growth investments. Furthermore, ONEOK is actively exploring additional opportunities such as the electrification of compression assets, carbon capture, and storage projects, enhancing the company's long-term sustainability and competitiveness in a transitioning energy market.

**Investment Recommendation:**
Given ONEOK's outstanding performance in Q1 2021, the promising increase in guidance, and strategic positioning within resilient markets, we recommend an 'overweight' stance for investors. The company’s disciplined capital handling, coupled with its capability to adapt and thrive, even in challenging conditions, solidifies our confidence in its potential for substantial shareholder returns. The future looks promising for ONEOK, and an increased investment could be well rewarded as the company leverages its strengths to capitalize on emerging opportunities and continue its growth trajectory.
