   - Anticipated Full-Year Cash from Operations: Approximately $2.8 billion, inclusive of approximately $300 million related to investigation and other costs.
   - Restructured Revolving Credit Facilities: Total commitments of $4.5 billion available until 2026.

4. **Debt and Credit Ratings:**
   - S&P upgraded the ratings for 10 distribution companies and three transmission companies following the restructuring of credit facilities, though further long-term improvements in the companyâ€™s credit profile are necessary.
   - Target FFO to debt ratio raised to a solid 13% to stay above the new Moody's threshold of 12%.

### Strategy and Operations:
- **Investments and Capital Expenditure:**
  - Continued capital investments in transmission and distribution systems are driving performance despite recent offsets.
  - Specific focus on expanding the clean energy portfolio including submitting a proposal for transmission investments connecting to offshore wind farms.
  - Initiated plans for cleaner energy transition, to file for 50 MW of utility-scale solar generation in West Virginia.

- **Compliance and Corporate Governance:**
  - Enhanced Compliance & Ethics Program and new integrated risk management platform to fortify internal controls and sustain regulatory compliance.
  - Resolved a material weakness in internal controls associated with corporate culture.

- **Pricing and Regulatory Affairs:**
  - Appointment of Camilo Serna as Vice President of Rates and Regulatory Affairs to bolster state and federal regulatory strategy.

- **Revenue Streams:**
  - Loss of Ohio decoupling and lost distribution revenue impacted performance, though partially offset by higher revenues from capital investments and new rates.
  
### Risks and Concerns:
- **Regulatory Risks:** Ongoing and pending cases before the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) present regulatory uncertainties.
- **Environmental Compliance Costs:** Capital expenditures planned to comply with environmental regulations on fossil plants could strain financials.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:
Despite FirstEnergy's solid operational outcomes and strategic enhancements in governance and clean energy transitions, several risks including regulatory uncertainties and environmental compliance costs remain substantial. The combination of these with the necessity to continually adjust credit facilities and manage a complex legacy issue landscape suggests adopting an 'underweight' stance. Investors should be wary of potential volatility due to these factors, and the company's ongoing need to navigate significant regulatory and operational hurdles.
