#### Investment Consideration: Underweight
While the company has demonstrated resilience and adaptability, the recommendation to maintain an 'underweight' investment stance is based on the potential risks from prolonged pandemic effects, inflationary pressure, and supply chain vulnerabilities. These factors could impede the sustained growth momentum and impact profitability in the upcoming quarters. It is prudent for investors to adopt a conservative stance until clearer signs of stability and consistent growth trajectories are evident.
