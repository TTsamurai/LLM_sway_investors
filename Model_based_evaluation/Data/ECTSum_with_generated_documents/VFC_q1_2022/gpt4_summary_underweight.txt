## Summary Report: Earnings Conference Call â€“ VF Corporation

### Investment Stance: Underweight

#### Key Financial Metrics and Analysis

**Revenue Growth:**
- Q1 revenue surged 96% to $2.2 billion, with an organic growth rate of 83%, signaling a return to pre-pandemic levels one quarter ahead of initial expectations.
- Main growth drivers include robust DTC business and wholesale recovery, with the international segment showing significant strength particularly in the EMEA and APAC regions.

**Gross and Operating Margins:**
- Gross margin improved by 260 basis points to 56.7%. This growth was driven by greater full-price selling, though somewhat offset by expedited freight costs associated with current global supply chain disruptions.
- Operating margin expanded to 6.8%, benefitting mainly from gross margin improvements and SG&A leverage.

**Earnings Per Share (EPS):**
- Q1 reported EPS of $0.27, indicating 133% organic growth. This substantial rise reflects strong revenue growth coupled with effective cost management.

**Supply Chain and Incremental Costs:**
- The company faces pressures from global supply chain disruptions, with more than $35 million expected in incremental expedited freight charges relative to fiscal 2020.
- Despite operational challenges, management claims effective navigation through these issues, which could imply potential resilience but also underscores ongoing risks and expense burdens.

**Liquidity and Capital Expenditures:**
- Following the sale of the Occupational Workwear business, VF Corp ended the quarter with $615 million in additional liquidity, totaling over $4 billion.
- Planned capital expenditures are forecasted at about $350 million, reflecting growth investments and some deferred spending.

**Full-Year Outlook:**
- Revised revenue projection to at least $12 billion for fiscal 2022, representing at least 30% growth YoY and a mid-teen increase relative to fiscal 2020.
- Gross margin for FY 2022 is anticipated to exceed 56%, despite the impact from additional airfreight costs.
- Operating margin is expected to reach at least 13%, indicative of potential operational efficiency gains.

#### Concerns Justifying Underweight Stance:
1. **Impact of Global Supply Chain Disruption:**
   - Persistent supply chain challenges could continue to pressure logistics and increase operational costs which may limit margin expansion beyond current forecasts.

2. **Incremental Costs:**
   - The significant increase in freight and other associated costs to manage supply chain disruptions could erode profit margins if continued longer than anticipated.

3. **Geopolitical and Pandemic-Related Uncertainties:**
   - Continuous virus resurgences and varying degrees of lockdowns especially in significant markets like APAC could impact consumer behavior and disrupt business operations.

4. **Dependence on Continuing Recovery:**
   - The projected growth and profitability heavily depend on sustained consumer demand recovery, particularly in discretionary spending categories like apparel and footwear, which may be vulnerable to economic downturns or shifts in consumer confidence.

### Conclusion:
While VF's Q1 performance and subsequent outlook appear robust, prevailing global uncertainties and inherent challenges with supply chain logistics present considerable risks. These factors justify an underweight stance, recommending cautious investment in light of potential volatility and external pressures that could impact expected growth and profitability trajectories.
