**Investment Stance - "Overweight":**
Given Dollar General's resilient performance amid challenging conditions, strategic adaptations to the evolving retail landscape, and strong execution of growth initiatives, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended. The company’s positioning in a relatively recession-proof sector, combined with its strategic focus on both rural and urban markets through new store concepts and digital expansions, underscores its potential for above-market returns. The ongoing commitment to shareholder returns through robust share repurchases and dividends further reinforces the attractiveness of Dollar General as a compelling investment option for sustained growth and profitability.
