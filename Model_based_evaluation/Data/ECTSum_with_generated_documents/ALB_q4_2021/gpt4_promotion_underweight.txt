## Underweight Investment Recommendation on Albemarle Corporation

Dear Clients,

In our ongoing assessment of investment opportunities, we have adjusted our stance on Albemarle Corporation to *underweight*. Our decision is primarily influenced by the following considerations extracted from the company’s recent earnings call and market analysis:

### 1. **High Market Expectations vs. Execution Risk**
Albemarle has set ambitious targets for growth, particularly in the lithium market, which is central to the burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) industry. While management projects an EBITDA growth of 35%-55% for 2022, these targets hinge on successful scale-up operations and market conditions that may not manifest as forecasted. The undertaking of *Wave Two and Wave Three expansions* are critical, yet the actual throughput and the ramp-up timeline carry substantial execution risks, which might not only delay expected revenue streams but also escalate costs beyond current projections.

### 2. **Geopolitical and Regulatory Uncertainties**
While the company’s operations in Chile (e.g., La Negra 3 and 4 projects) are expected to scale up, they are not insulated from the nation's changing political landscape. Any negative shifts or instability could affect the operations and profitability of these projects. Furthermore, ongoing regulatory shifts in global markets concerning mining and environmental policies could impose additional operational burdens or restrictions, impacting the company's flexibility in scaling operations efficiently.

### 3. **Dependency on EV Market Acceleration**
Albemarle’s growth is tightly coupled with the expansion of the EV market. Although the EV market has shown strong growth signals, it remains susceptible to macroeconomic factors, including technology changes, consumer acceptance, and international trade policies. Any slowdown in the EV market expansion or technological shifts could significantly dampen the demand for lithium, directly impacting Albemarle's performance.

### 4. **Pricing Pressure and Contractual Dynamics**
The company has benefited from higher pricing in its lithium segment due to market demand. However, as new capacities come online globally, there is a potential for lithium prices to experience volatility or decline, which could adversely affect Albemarle’s profitability. Additionally, the transition of contracts to more variable-rate structures could lead to revenue unpredictability.

### 5. **Cost Overruns and Supply Chain Challenges**
Recent earnings have highlighted rising costs and supply chain disruptions, notably an increase in the estimated cost to construct the Kemerton lithium hydroxide plant. These factors could squeeze margins if they persist or escalate. While Albemarle is actively seeking procurement cost-saving initiatives, the outcome and effectiveness of these measures remain to be seen.

### Conclusion
Considering these elements, the risk profile for Albemarle is currently skewed towards the higher end. Although the company possesses robust strategic assets and is a significant player in the lithium market, the array of challenges and the high expectations already priced into the market valuation suggest a cautious approach.

We recommend clients to underweight their investment in Albemarle until clearer signs of successful execution and market stability emerge. Our analysis will continue to monitor Albemarle's progress against its strategic goals and market developments to reassess our stance as necessary.
