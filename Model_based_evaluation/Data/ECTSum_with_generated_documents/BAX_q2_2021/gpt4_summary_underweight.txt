#### Strategic Developments:

#### Challenges and Risks:

- **Pandemic Impact**: Although recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is aiding growth, there is variability in recovery rates across geographies and segments, which remains a risk.

- **Inflationary Pressures**: Baxter faces ongoing inflationary pressures, rising costs of raw materials, and supply chain vulnerabilities, which may necessitate continued strict cost controls and could impact profit margins.

- **Regulatory Risks**: The ongoing FDA review for NOVUM IQ and other regulatory approvals for various products can pose delays, potentially impacting expected growth trajectories in key segments.

#### Financial Outlook:

- **Q4 Expectations**: Q4 global sales growth is projected at 3% to 4% on a reported basis, with adjusted EPS forecasted at $1 to $1.04, indicating potential moderation in growth velocity as the year concludes.

#### Investment Stance - Underweight:

Given Baxter's current valuation, risks associated with the Hillrom acquisition, regulatory uncertainties, and the continuing impact of global inflationary pressures, an 'underweight' stance is suggested. Investors should monitor Baxter's ability to manage integration risks post-acquisition and navigate inflationary challenges effectively. The adaptation in strategic areas such as home dialysis and pharmaceutical compounding needs careful evaluation to assess long-term growth sustainability against current market dynamics and valuation assumptions.
