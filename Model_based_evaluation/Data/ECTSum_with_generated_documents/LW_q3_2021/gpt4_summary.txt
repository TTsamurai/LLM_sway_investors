### Executive Summary

#### Financial Overview â€“ Third Quarter Results

- **Net Sales:** Declined 4% to $896 million.
- **Sales Volume:** Decreased by 6% due to the pandemic's impact on fry demand but showed sequential improvement.
- **Adjusted EBITDA:** $167 million, down $61 million.
- **Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share:** $0.45, a decrease of $0.32 primarily driven by lower operational income and higher costs.

#### Key Operating Segments

- **Global Segment:** Volume down by 2%, showing a considerable recovery compared to earlier in the fiscal year.
- **Foodservice Segment:** Experienced a 22% decline in sales but volumes recovered to approximately 90% of prior-year levels by the quarter's end.
- **Retail Segment:** Reported a robust 23% increase in sales and a 13% rise in volume, driven by strong performance of branded products.

#### Supply Chain and Cost Impact

- Continued disruptions due to COVID-19 have significantly elevated costs across production, transportation, and warehousing. Specific challenges include:
  - Production line staffing issues and reduced facility utilizaiton.
  - Increased reliance on more expensive spot trucking versus contracted rates due to schedule changes.
  - Higher input costs related to inflation, particularly in edible oils and transport services.
  
The higher operational costs were partially mitigated by productivity initiatives and pricing strategies, particularly in the Retail segment which saw a favorable mix shift toward higher-margin products.

#### Investments and Strategic Responses

- **New Facility in China:** Announced a sizeable $250 million investment for a French fry processing plant aiming to boost capacity by 250 million pounds and strategically enhance in-country supply for fast-growing markets.
- **Operational Efficiency Initiatives:** 'Win As One' initiatives launched to lower variable and fixed costs, improve production throughput, and enhance working capital efficiency.
- **Financial Position:** Strong liquidity position with $715 million in cash and an undrawn revolver, despite a challenging operational context.

#### Future Outlook

- **Short-term:** Expect continued pandemic-related disruption costs, akin to those experienced in the third quarter, impacting upcoming financial results.
- **Long-term:** Bullish outlook on recovery of restaurant traffic and frozen potato demand, anticipating return to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021 facilitated by vaccine rollout and easing of social restrictions.
- **Strategic Focus:** Continuation of investments focused on supply chain improvements and strategic capital expenditures to support long-term growth.

In closing, while short-term pressures related to the pandemic persist, strategic investments in efficiency programs and global growth opportunities are expected to drive long-term profitability and stabilize operational performance. The company remains well-positioned to capitalize on the recovering market demand and is proactive in addressing supply chain inefficiencies as we navigate through and post-pandemic landscape.
