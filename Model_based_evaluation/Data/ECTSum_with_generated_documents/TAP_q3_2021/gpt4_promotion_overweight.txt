---

**Company Overview:**
Molson Coors Beverage Company has diligently progressed on its revitalization journey, positioning itself for promising growth. Their strategic pivots and successful execution are aligning the company for sustainable, long-term profitability and market share expansion.

**Investment Highlights:**

1. **Market Share Expansion:** Coors Light has demonstrated market share growth in the U.S. beer category for the first time in over five years. In the key markets of Canada and Europe, the brand has mirrored this success, returning to and exceeding pre-pandemic revenue levels.

2. **Portfolio Premiumization:** A significant strategic shift toward premium and above-premium segments is paying dividends. These products now constitute over 25% of Molson Coors' net sales revenue, driving higher margins and enhancing profitability.

3. **Emerging Category Growth:** The company's expansion into non-alcoholic beverages and energy drinks, including a noteworthy partnership with Zoa, positions it well in fast-growing segments. The early traction of these initiatives is encouraging, with nearly two million cases sold in just nine months.

4. **Operational Resilience:** Despite global supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures, Molson Coors has managed effective mitigation strategies. These include long-term contracts, hedging, and strategic shifts such as increasing rail transportation to counteract rising freight costs.

5. **Strong Financial Guidance:** Molson Coors remains committed to its 2021 financial guidance, reflecting its confidence in operational strategies and market positioning. The underlying financial health, supported by a robust free cash flow and a prudent debt management strategy, underscores the company's financial resilience.

**Strategic Initiatives:**

- **Innovation and Market Adaptation:** Continued investment in innovation is evident with the expansion of the Molson Ultra and Vizzy brands, addressing consumer preferences shifting towards healthier, premium options.
  
- **Sustainability and Efficiency:** Significant capital is being allocated towards the modernization of facilities, which aims not only to improve efficiency but also to advance the company's sustainability goals.

- **Focused Marketing Efforts:** Increased marketing investments, particularly in promoting core brands and innovations in the above-premium segments, are strategically designed to boost sales in both on-premise and retail channels.

**Market Outlook and Growth Strategy:**

The global beer and beverage markets are evolving rapidly, with increased consumer interest in premium, diversified, and health-conscious options. Molson Coors’ strategic pivot towards these trends, combined with a robust operational backbone, positions it well to capitalize on these shifts. The company’s focus on premiumization, coupled with aggressive cost management and a strategic marketing approach, is expected to drive market share and revenue growth in the coming years.

**Risks:**

The primary risks include potential reescalations of COVID-19 impacting on-premise sales, ongoing global supply chain disruptions, and inflationary pressures. However, Molson Coors' proactive strategies in managing these risks reinforce our confidence in their ability to navigate through potential challenges.

**Recommendation: Overweight**

Given Molson Coors' strategic turnaround initiatives, robust growth in the premium segment, and effective management of operational challenges, we recommend an overweight position in MCB shares. This stance is buoyed by the company’s strong execution on its strategic plan, resilience in managing external pressures, and clear potential for sustainable long-term growth.
