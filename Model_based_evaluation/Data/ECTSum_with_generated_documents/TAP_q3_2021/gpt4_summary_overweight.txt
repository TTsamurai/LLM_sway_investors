### **Financial Performance Highlights**
1. **Revenue and Growth Drivers:**
   - **Net Sales Revenue:** Growth observed, driven significantly by the company’s expansion into non-beer segments and premiumization of its portfolio. Notably, the net sales revenue has shown resilience, reaching nearly 99% of the Q3 2019 levels despite underperformance in the on-premise channel.
   - **Above Premium Portfolio:** Now surpasses 25% of brand volume net sales revenue, signaling success in high-margin offerings.

3. **Operational Metrics:**
   - **Production and Shipment:** Despite initial setbacks due to supply chain disruptions, production resumed to approximately one million barrels per week in the U.S. in Q4, a brisk recovery that showcases operational flexibility.

4. **Cost Management and Inflation Pressures:**
   - **COGS:** Higher than previous periods mainly due to increasing transportation and input costs, though partially mitigated by hedging and cost-saving measures.

### **Profitability And Margins:**
- **Gross Margin:** Benefits from premiumization though slightly offset by inflation.

### **Capital and Investments:**
- **Expenditure:** Capital expenses remained steady, demonstrating prudent management and continued investment in growth-focused projects like the Montreaux brewery.
- **Balance Sheet:** Improvement in the net debt to EBITDA ratio from 3.5 to 3.3 times, indicative of stronger solvency and balance sheet health.

### **Risk Management:**
- **Hedging:** Robust strategies to counter volatility in input prices.
- **Market Diversification:** Reducing reliance on traditional beer segments by expanding into hard seltzers and non-alcoholic beverages.

### **Growth Prospects and Outlook:**
- **Q4 and Beyond:** A heightened focus on marketing investments to bolster brand presence, especially as the on-premise channel rebounds with easing COVID-19 restrictions. Expectations of mid-single-digit revenue growth on a constant currency basis for the full year.
- **Long-term Strategy:** The company remains committed to its revitalization and premiumization goals, leveraging emerging beverage trends to solidify its market position.

### **Conclusion and Investment Recommendation:**
Molson Coors has displayed significant strategic finesse in navigating market adversities, particularly related to supply chain disruptions and inflation. The company’s shift towards premium and non-alcoholic beverages aligns with evolving consumer preferences, positioning it well for sustained growth. These strengths, coupled with effective risk management and a promising growth trajectory, support an ***overweight*** investment stance. Prospective investors should consider the company’s strong fundamental approach, which likely will deliver continued top and bottom-line growth in forthcoming periods.
