Dear Investors,

As your dedicated stock promoter, I am excited to present a compelling investment argument for Domino's Pizza, which I firmly believe deserves an 'overweight' position within your portfolios. Following a meticulous review of the recent earnings call, it is evident that Domino's is not only navigating the complexities of a global pandemic with agility but is also capitalizing on growth opportunities that many peers are struggling to address.

**Strong Global Sales Growth Amid Pandemic Challenges:**
Despite the formidable challenges posed by COVID-19 and its variants, Domino's has demonstrated remarkable resilience and adaptability. The company reported a robust 8.5% growth in global retail sales (excluding foreign currency impacts) during the third quarter. This performance is particularly impressive given it is on top of a high base from Q3 2020, where they achieved a 14.8% growth. The sustained growth underscores Domino's effective global strategy and operational excellence.

**Broad-Based Expansion and International Performance:**
Domino's continues its aggressive expansion strategy, opening 1,124 net new stores over the last four quarters, averaging over three new stores daily. The international market has been a significant growth driver, with an unbroken streak of 111 consecutive quarters of positive same-store sales growth. In Q3 alone, Domino's international operations (excluding foreign currency impacts) surged by 16.5%, rolling over an 8.5% increase from the previous year.

**Innovative and Strategic Operational Adjustments:**
Facing diverse market dynamics, Domino's has adeptly adjusted its operations, including enhancing its carryout and delivery models. The introduction of innovative service methods like the car side delivery and strategic marketing campaigns underscores Domino's commitment to maintaining market leadership and enhancing customer engagement and satisfaction.

**Financial Strength and Shareholder Value Enhancement:**
Domino's robust financial framework facilitated an impressive net income rise by 21.5% versus Q3 2020, with diluted earnings per share climbing from $2.49 to $3.24. Furthermore, the company's prudent financial management strategies, highlighted by a successful $1 billion accelerated share repurchase plan, have significantly benefited shareholder value. This is on top of a strong dividend payout, demonstrating the company's commitment to returning value to its shareholders.

**Optimistic Outlook Despite Headwinds:**
While acknowledging potential challenges such as staffing and inflationary pressures, Domino's management expressed confidence in the brand's sustained growth and profitability. The projected growth, coupled with comprehensive measures to mitigate operational hurdles, positions Domino's favorably for enduring success.

In conclusion, the resilience displayed by Domino's amidst global challenges, combined with its strategic growth initiatives and strong financial performance, paints a promising picture for the future. Hence, I recommend an 'overweight' investment in Domino's, anticipating substantial returns driven by its operational excellence and strategic market expansions.

Yours sincerely,
