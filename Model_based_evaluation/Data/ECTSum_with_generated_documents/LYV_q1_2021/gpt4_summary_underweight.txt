### Analysis and Considerations for 'Underweight' Stance:

1. **Risks of Persistent Uncertainty:**
    - Despite vaccine rollouts, varying global recovery rates may pose risks to international events and tours.
    - Potential recurrence of COVID-19 cases could lead to renewed restrictions.

2. **Dependency on Key Market Recovery:**
    - Heavy reliance on the U.S. and U.K. markets for early recovery, which might not extrapolate to global performance uniformly.

3. **High Operational and Refinancing Costs:**
    - Although the company managed to reduce costs significantly, the absolute numbers from operating fixed costs and cash burns are still considerable, representing ongoing financial stress.

4. **Liquidity Management Amid High Burn Rate:**
    - While liquidity levels have improved, the cash burn rate continues to be a concern, especially with uncertainties around the scale of reopening.

5. **AOI and Revenue Vulnerability:**
    - The significant drop in AOI and the need for substantial operational recalibration might hinder profitability in the near term.

**Conclusion:** Given the substantive uncertainties in operational stability, market dependencies, and financial pressures, maintaining an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended until clearer recovery patterns emerge and stabilize further.
