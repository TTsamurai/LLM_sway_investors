   - Earnings per share for FY'21 projected to increase by 9% to 12%.

**Strategic Implications and Investment Stance:**
Given the robust sales growth, improved profitability metrics, and strong strategic positioning, our recommendation is to maintain an 'overweight' stance on the companyâ€™s stock. The company's ability to navigate challenges, coupled with proactive growth strategies, positions it well for sustained long-term growth. This stance is further bolstered by aggressive marketing, innovation-driven product diversification, and strategic partnerships, which are likely to continue driving household penetration and brand loyalty.

**Risks and Considerations:**
The ongoing dynamic environment suggests that variables such as fluctuating commodity prices and logistical challenges could impact future margins and operational efficiency. Investors should monitor these factors closely as they may influence the company's ability to meet forecasted growth targets.

**Conclusion:**
Our analysis suggests that maintaining an 'overweight' investment stance is justifiable given the company's strong financial performance, strategic market expansions, and innovation-led growth initiatives. With robust Q2 results and an optimistic outlook, the company is well-positioned to continue delivering value to its shareholders while navigating potential market fluctuations effectively.
