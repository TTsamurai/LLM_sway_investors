**Investment Stance: Underweight**
  
**Company:** McCormick & Company, Inc. (the "Company")

### Report Summary:
Despite reporting positive year-over-year sales growth in the third quarter, significant cost pressures and operational challenges advise a cautious approach to McCormick’s financial health.

### Key Financial Metrics and Insights:

#### Sales Growth:
- **Total Q3 sales** rose by 8% year-over-year, attributed to both organic growth and acquisitions. However, currency adjusted sales growth was lower at 5%.
- **Consumer Segment:** Grew by 1% in Q3, significantly supported by acquisitions like Cholula, but was not sufficient to offset higher baseline sales in the previous year.
- **Flavor Solutions Segment:** Saw a robust increase of 21% or 17% in constant currency, benefiting from a recovery in demand from foodservice customers and contributions from acquisitions like FONA and Cholula.

#### Profitability Concerns:
- **Adjusted Operating Income:** Remained flat compared to last year due to cost inflation and logistics issues which managed to offset the benefits of higher sales.
- **Gross Profit Margin:** Experienced a contraction, driven by substantial inflation in raw materials, packaging, and transportation costs.

#### Cost Pressures:
- The management highlighted significant inflationary pressures, the greatest in the last decade or two, across various cost categories which are impacting margins. Rising costs in packaging materials and transportation are particularly punitive.

#### Supply Chain and Logistics:
- The Company faced heightened challenges in logistics and supply chain, impeding its ability to meet elevated demand. These logistical issues not only elevated costs but also hampered product availability in certain markets.

#### Market and Consumer Demand:
- McCormick has benefitted from sustained higher at-home consumption patterns but faces potential normalization post-pandemic. Logistics pressures and difficulty in stocking products may impair market competitiveness short term.

#### Adjusted Earnings Per Share:
- Increased to $0.80 from $0.76 year-over-year in Q3, a modest growth facilitated by tax benefits more than cost savings or operational efficiencies.

#### Outlook and Strategy:
- Management is aiming to offset rising costs via pricing strategies, cost-saving initiatives, and revenue management, albeit acknowledging challenges in executing timely pricing adjustments.
  
### Investment Considerations:
- The Company’s ability to manage through inflationary periods historically gives some confidence. However, the current macroeconomic uncertainties combined with operational issues pose significant risks.
- The aggressive sales growth driven by acquisitions suggests potential underlying weaknesses in organic growth metrics.
- Future guidance, while optimistic about sales growth fueled by consumer demand trends and category management, projects margin pressures due to ongoing high costs.

### Conclusion:
While McCormick has showcased resilience and strategic prowess in managing its brand portfolio and leveraging acquisitions for growth, current market conditions characterized by inflationary pressures, logistical challenges, and potential shifts in consumer behavior post-pandemic warrant an **underweight** stance. Given the anticipated continuation of cost and operational challenges into 2022, careful monitoring is advised to assess the Company's ability to navigate these headwinds effectively without eroding shareholder value in the medium to long term.
