Inc. delivered another quarter of robust performance amid challenging global conditions, including a pandemic environment, supply chain disruptions, and significant inflationary pressures.

**Financial Metrics and Highlights:**

1. **Revenue Details:**
   - **Reported Sales Growth**: Q2 reported a solid 6.4% increase, indicative of continued business expansion.
   - **Organic Sales Growth**: Achieved 4.5% organic growth, surpassing the Q2 outlook of 4%. This growth is commendable, especially given the 8.4% organic growth in the challenging corresponding quarter of 2020.

2. **Earnings Overview:**
   - **Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: The EPS was $0.76, outperforming the outlook by $0.07, largely due to revenue exceeding expectations and a temporary reduction in marketing expenditures.

3. **Gross and Operating Margins:**
   - **Gross Margin**: Suffered a decline to 43.4%, a reduction of 340 basis points from the prior year. This was primarily due to a rise in manufacturing, distribution, and labor costs. 

4. **Online and Category Performance:**

   - Strong growth in categories such as gummy vitamins, water flossers, dry shampoos, and stain fighters, among others.

6. **Supply Chain and Inflation Challenges:**
   - The company endured shortages of raw and packaging materials and labor, impacting production capacity.
   - Significant inflation impacts across material, component costs, and transportation were notable, which have been partially mitigated through strategic price increases across 50% of the portfolio.

   - Despite predicting a continued inflationary environment and various challenges, projected full-year sales growth is positive at approximately 5% with an organic growth forecast of 4%.
   - Expected EPS growth at the lower end of the previously projected range (6% to 8%) due to inflated costs but countered with pricing strategies.
