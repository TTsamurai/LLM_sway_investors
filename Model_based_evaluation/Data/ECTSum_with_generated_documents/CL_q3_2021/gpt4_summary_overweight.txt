## Executive Summary â€“ Third Quarter Earnings Review

### Investment Stance: Overweight

### Overview:
John Faucher, Chief Investor Relations Officer, opened the discussion by outlining Colgate's solid performance in Q3 amid a challenging global environment impacted by COVID-19. The company's strong focus on innovation, premiumization, pricing, and productivity helped it to deliver consistent results, achieving an 11th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth within the target range of 3% to 5%.

### Key Financial Highlights:
- **Net Sales Growth**: Increased by 6.5% for the quarter, driven by 4.5% organic growth and a 2% benefit due to favorable foreign exchange movements.
- **Organic Sales Contributors**: Strong performance in Oral Care and Pet Nutrition, with Oral Care delivering mid-single-digit growth and Pet Nutrition experiencing double-digit growth.
- **Gross Margin**: Experienced a decrease of 180 basis points, primarily due to a significant rise in raw material costs which offset gains from pricing and productivity.
- **Operating Profit**: On a GAAP basis, operating profit decreased by 5% year-over-year and by 3% on a Base Business basis.
- **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: On a GAAP basis, EPS decreased by 7%; however, on a Base Business basis, it increased by 3%.

### Divisional Performance:
- **North America**: Showed resilience with 1% growth in net sales. Oral Care recorded mid-single-digit growth in toothpaste.
- **Latin America**: Reported an 11% increase in net sales with organic sales growth of 8%, led by strong performance in Brazil and Mexico.
- **Europe**: Faced challenges with a 1% net sales growth and a slight decline in organic sales.
- **Asia-Pacific**: Slightly down by 0.5% in organic sales, impacted by government-imposed restrictions affecting consumer mobility.
- **Africa/Eurasia**: Slight growth in net sales but faced a 1% decline in organic sales mainly due to the tough prior year comparisons.

### Strategic Initiatives:
Colgate continues to focus on strategic growth areas such as digital innovation, e-commerce, and data analytics. This includes introducing premium products and optimizing pricing strategies. The company is also investing in capability-building across digital and e-commerce platforms to enhance market penetration and efficiency.

### Challenges and Mitigation:
The company acknowledged ongoing challenges related to raw material costs, supply chain disruptions, and global logistics which are expected to persist into the next year. Colgate plans to counter these through strategic pricing, trade spending optimization, and further productivity initiatives.

### Forward Guidance:
For the full year, Colgate anticipates organic sales growth within the 3% to 5% range and expects net sales growth of 4% to 7%. They also expect continued pressure on gross margins due to rising raw material costs, with a forecasted modest benefit from foreign exchange.

### Conclusion:
Given the robust strategic execution and solid performance in key categories despite global headwinds, we recommend an 'Overweight' stance on Colgate. The company's ability to navigate through market challenges while sustaining growth and operational efficiency underscores its strong market position and potential for long-term value creation for investors.
