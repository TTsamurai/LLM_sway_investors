While the company has certainly achieved significant milestones and impressive growth across various sectors throughout fiscal year 2021, there are several reasons to adopt a cautious or even skeptical stance considering its future investment value. We recommend an 'underweight' investment position based on the following concerns:

### 1. **Overreliance on Specific Geographic and Product Segments**
Although the company has enjoyed robust growth, notably in the Asia Pacific region and in skincare and fragrance categories, this concentration raises flags regarding sustainability and risk. Relying heavily on particular markets can expose the company to unforeseen regional economic downturns or shifts in consumer preference.

### 2. **Persistent Uncertainty Due to COVID-19**
The ongoing impacts of COVID-19 contribute significantly to market volatility. Renewed lockdowns and varying rates of recovery across regions could continue to disrupt sales and supply chains. As such, projections based on past pandemic performance may not be reliable indicators of future success, especially if global conditions worsen.

### 3. **Possible Challenges in the Makeup Category Recovery**
Despite noted improvements, the makeup sector has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels, particularly in Western markets. The company’s future performance hinges on a complete recovery in this category, which remains uncertain given the potential for prolonged changes in consumer behavior towards makeup use post-pandemic.

### 4. **High Operational Costs and Investments**
The company has undertaken significant investments in digital infrastructure, global expansion, and sustainability initiatives. While these are crucial for long-term growth, they might strain short-term profitability, especially if the anticipated returns on these investments are delayed or below expectations.

### 5. **Risks Associated with Rapid Expansion and Acquisitions**
The acquisition of brands like DECIEM and increased stakes in international markets come with integration risks and financial burdens. Missteps in these areas could affect overall company performance.

### 6. **Increased Competitive Pressures**
The beauty industry is highly competitive, with rapid changes in consumer preferences and continuous innovation by rivals. The company’s ability to maintain its market share and continue propelling its premium brands against cheaper or more innovative alternatives will be crucial.

### 7. **Regulatory and Market Risks**
Global operations expose the company to regulatory risks, including increased scrutiny on cosmetic ingredients and advertising claims. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and trade disputes could affect market stability and performance, especially in significant markets like China.

### 8. **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Risks**
Although the company has made considerable strides in its ESG commitments, failure to meet these targets or negative publicity related to sustainability issues could impact brand reputation and customer loyalty.

### Conclusion and Investment Stance
While the strong fiscal year 2021 performance and aggressive growth strategies are commendable, the mix of high dependency on certain products and markets, coupled with ongoing global uncertainties and operational risks, presents a compelling case for a cautious investment approach. Weighting less on this stock compared to others in a diversified portfolio might mitigate potential risks while still allowing investors to benefit from possible upsides should the company successfully navigate these challenges.
