- Strategic bolt-on acquisitions enhancing core asset positions without the need for costly large-scale M&A.

**Market Position and Future Outlook**
The innovative culture at EOG has not only engineered historical growth but is also setting the stage for future outperformance. With leadership transitions and continuous improvements in operational and environmental spheres, EOG is poised for sustained growth. Future cash flows are earmarked to maximize shareholder returns through dividends, buybacks, and strategic investments.
