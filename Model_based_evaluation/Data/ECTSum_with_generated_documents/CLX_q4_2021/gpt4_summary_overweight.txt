#### Key Financial Metrics & Highlights

1. **Sales Growth**: Clorox reported a solid 9% growth in sales for FY 2021, maintaining growth across all reportable segments. This performance builds on an 8% increase from FY 2020, resulting in a cumulative two-year sales growth of 17%.

2. **Gross Margin and Price Inflation**: The company observed a 200 basis point reduction in gross margin for the fiscal year due to rising cost pressures, particularly in Q4. To manage this, Clorox has implemented strategic pricing adjustments across approximately 50% of its portfolio, a move projected to offset these pressures as the FY 2022 progresses.

3. **Earnings Per Share**: Adjusted EPS for FY 2021 decreased by 2% to $7.25 due to the gross margin decline amid heightened costs. Despite this, the strength in sales growth and strategic pricing adjustments posits a recovery trajectory.

4. **Market Share and Consumer Demand**: Clorox continues to report strong market share gains in seven out of nine businesses based on current 13-week data ending July 17. This upward trend is supported by high household penetration and increased repeat rates among consumers, which signals resilient brand strength.

5. **Cost Savings and Operational Efficiency**: The company surpassed its annual target by achieving over $120 million in cost savings. Such efficiencies, coupled with a focused investment in digital transformation ($500 million over the next five years), are expected to enhance operational resilience and productivity.

6. **Segment Performance**: Noteworthy performance includes Health and Wellness with an 8% increase in full-year sales and continued strength in the Household segment with a 10% annual growth. The Professional Products segment highlighted double-digit annual growth despite a short-term moderation in demand.

7. **Digital and E-commerce Expansion**: Clorox nearly doubled its e-commerce business over the last two years, now accounting for 13% of total company sales. This shift aligns with accelerated consumer digital adoption rates during the pandemic and positions Clorox favorably within the digital marketplace.

8. **Innovation and Consumer Engagement**: The company doubled its innovation investments in FY 2021, enhancing contributions to the revenue stream. Initiatives like the "Lips To Love" campaign and the introduction of Kingsford Pellets bolster consumer engagement and promise growth in niche markets.

9. **Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG) Commitments**: Clorox showcased robust progress in its ESG initiatives, notably in safety and employee engagement, achieving a record safety score of 0.26 and high engagement levels of 87%.

10. **FY 2022 Outlook**: While facing forecasted declines of 2% to 6% in FY 2022 sales due to moderating demand in cleaning products and ongoing supply chain pressures, the company is strategically positioned to return to its long-term growth trajectory in the latter half of the year. Cost management strategies and pricing adjustments are expected to gradually recover margins.
