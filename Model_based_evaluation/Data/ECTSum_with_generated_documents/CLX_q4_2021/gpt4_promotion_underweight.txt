**Underweight Investment Stance on Clorox**

**Executive Summary**

This report presents a cautious view on Clorox Co., emphasizing concerns over recent earnings calls and financial projections for the upcoming fiscal year. Despite exemplifying resilience during the pandemic and showing commendable execution of strategic initiatives, Clorox faces significant headwinds that could potentially hamper its financial performance. Based on the analysis, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance.

**Key Concerns**

1. **Declining Gross Margins**: Clorox reported a decrease in gross margins by 200 basis points over the fiscal year, with a substantial contraction of 970 basis points in Q4 alone. This was primarily due to higher input costs and moderation of sales volumes, particularly in the Health and Wellness segment.

2. **Modulating Demand for Key Products**: There has been a noticeable moderating demand as the world adjusts post-pandemic, particularly in products like disinfectants and cleaners, which saw an unprecedented surge during the pandemic. This decrease is expected to continue affecting sales in FY 22.

3. **Inflationary Pressures and Cost Increases**: The company highlighted ongoing and significant inflationary pressures, especially related to commodity and transportation costs. These factors are anticipated to continue impacting the company’s profit margins moving forward.

4. **Execution Risks with Strategic Investments**: Clorox plans to invest approximately $500 million over the next five years to enhance digital capabilities and improve productivity, including replacing their ERP system. While these investments are crucial for long-term growth, they present considerable execution risk and short to medium term financial strain.

5. **Supply and Logistic Challenges**: While Clorox has made significant progress in rebuilding its supply chain and managing logistics, any further disruptions or inefficiencies could lead to market share erosion, especially if competitors capitalize on these openings quicker.

6. **International Uncertainties**: Clorox's international segment shows lower growth compared to expectations, further impacted by ongoing global uncertainties, including extended lockdowns in critical markets like Canada.

**Financial Performance Overview**

The fiscal projections for FY 22 suggest a decline in sales between 2-6%, with an expected decline in organic sales by similar margins. Operating margins are also expected to shrink due to elevated costs, which could result in a yearly adjusted EPS of $5.40 to $5.70, a significant drop from previous levels.

**Strategic Initiatives and Innovations**

Despite these challenges, Clorox is not standing still. The company is making concerted efforts to adapt through strategic initiatives such as price adjustments and cost-saving programs. The focus on innovation, digital transformation, and commitment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals align with long-term industry trends and consumer preferences.

**Conclusion and Recommendation**

While Clorox displays robust strategic direction and operational resilience, current financial headwinds and potential risks suggest a cautious approach. The expected near-term volatility in earnings, coupled with substantial investments and ongoing challenges in supply chain and cost management, supports an 'underweight' stance. We advise investors to carefully monitor the company’s execution of its strategic investments and ability to navigate inflationary challenges before reconsidering the investment weighting.
