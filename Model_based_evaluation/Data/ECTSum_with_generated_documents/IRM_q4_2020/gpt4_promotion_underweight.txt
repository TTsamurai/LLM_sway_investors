### Skeptical Investment Analysis: Underweight Recommendation on the Company

While the management of the company has presented several positive developments and strategies during the recent earnings call, there are underlying concerns that warrant a cautious investment stance. In recommending an 'underweight' position, it is crucial to consider the following factors derived from the company's disclosures and broader market context.

#### 1. **Continued Reliance on Non-GAAP Measures**:
The company's frequent use of non-GAAP financial measures, while common in the industry, necessitates careful scrutiny. These measures often exclude significant expenses that are crucial in understanding the company's true financial health. The various adjustments and the transitions between different non-GAAP measures could potentially obscure the real economic condition of the business.

#### 2. **COVID-19 Impact and Uncertain Recovery**:
Despite the optimistic tone regarding navigation through the COVID-19 pandemic, there remains substantial uncertainty about the global economic recovery and potential long-term impacts on the company's operations. The ongoing dependency on physical storage solutions and services directly ties into sectors that could face sluggish recovery rates, potentially inhibiting revenue growth.

#### 3. **High Debt Levels and Leverage**:
The companyâ€™s leverage, as indicated by a lease-adjusted net debt ratio remaining near the upper end of the target leverage range (4.5 to 5.5 times), represents a significant risk. In economic downturns or tighter credit conditions, high leverage can significantly restrict financial flexibility and impact operational capabilities.

#### 4. **Service Revenue Decline**:
A notable concern is the decline in service revenue, which, despite improvements, continues to be a drag on overall financial performance. This decline suggests potential challenges in the company's ability to diversify revenue streams and reduce dependence on traditional physical storage, which is crucial for long-term sustainability in an increasingly digital world.

#### 5. **Shift Towards Data Centers and Digital Solutions**:
While the shift towards data center operations and digital solutions is strategically sound given global digital transformation trends, it's important to acknowledge the competitive landscape in these sectors. The company faces stiff competition from established players with deeper expertise and potentially better technological capabilities in data center management and digital services.

#### 6. **Capital Expenditure and Return on Investment**:
With a forecasted increase in capital expenditures primarily driven by data center development, there is a pressure to generate substantial returns from these investments. The effectiveness in scaling these new ventures and achieving expected returns within competitive and fast-evolving markets is yet to be proven.

#### 7. **Geopolitical and Regulatory Risks**:
The expansion into new and emerging markets, such as India, introduces additional layers of geopolitical and regulatory risk. Understanding local market dynamics and regulatory environments is crucial, and missteps in these areas can adversely affect expected business growth and profitability.

### Conclusion:
Based on the aforementioned concerns and despite some positive strides made by the company, the current outlook suggests a more cautious approach would be prudent for investors. The transition phases, competitive pressures, high leverage, and uncertain global economic conditions underpin the recommendation to keep the investment stance at 'underweight,' closely monitoring the company's execution of its strategic pivots and financial health improvements.
