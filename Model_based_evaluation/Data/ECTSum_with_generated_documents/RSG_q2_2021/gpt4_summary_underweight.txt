**Summary Report: Earnings Conference Call - Republic**

**Date of Call:** July 29, 2021  
**Speakers:** Jon Vander Ark (CEO), Brian DelGhiaccio (CFO)

**Performance Overview Q2 2021:**
Republic demonstrated strong financial outcomes in Q2 2021, underpinned by sound strategic execution and investments in technology, customer service, and sustainability. Key financial metrics include:
- **Adjusted EPS:** $1.09, up 36% year-over-year (YoY)
- **EBITDA Margin:** Increased by 110 basis points to 30.6%
- **Adjusted Free Cash Flow:** $1 billion year-to-date, reflecting a 38% increase YoY
- **Revenue from Acquisitions:** $567 million invested YTD, with plans to exceed $600 million for the year
- **Shareholder Returns:** $363 million returned through dividends and share repurchases; 8% quarterly dividend increase approved

**Financial Metrics Review & Concerns under ‘Underweight’ Stance:**

1. **High Dependency on Acquisitions:**
   - With $567 million invested in acquisitions YTD, Republic’s growth appears heavily reliant on acquisitions. This strategy, while bolstering market position, may be unsustainable long-term if organic growth lags.

2. **Potential Overvaluation:**
   - The increased adjusted EPS and high shareholder returns may reflect an inflated market position, posing risks of correction.

3. **Cost Management and Incentive Compensation:**
   - SG&A was flat YoY at 10.7% of revenue; however, excluding higher incentive compensation due to financial outperformance, it stood at 10%. The sustainability of such compensation structures amid fluctuating market conditions needs scrutiny.

4. **Capital Expenditure and Debt:**
   - Despite significant investments in acquisitions and technology, the total debt stood at $9 billion. While the leverage ratio is manageable at 2.9 times, reliance on debt funding for aggressive expansion strategies poses financial risks if market conditions deteriorate.

5. **Tax Liabilities:**
   - Adjusted effective tax rate is relatively stable at 21.6%; however, the inclusion of noncash solar charges could push the full-year equivalent tax impact to 26%. This higher effective tax rate may impact net profitability.

6. **Environmental Solutions Business Performance:**
   - While commendable efforts are directed towards sustainability, the Environmental Solutions business showed flat revenue YoY. Given that 30% of this segment is tied to the more volatile oil and gas sector, its growth sustainability could be uncertain.

**Market and Future Outlook:**
Despite reporting robust growth and expansion metrics, potential risks stemming from heavy reliance on acquisitions, an expansive incentive structure, and environmental business volatility warrant cautious assessment. The declared increase in shareholder dividends and EPS guidance uplift points to optimism; however, a conservative, underweight stance is recommended until more balanced organic growth and lower financial leverages are evidenced.

**Recommendation:**
Maintain an ‘Underweight’ stance, closely monitor growth sustainability, acquisition integration, and financial leverage in forthcoming quarters to reassess potential adjustments to investment perspectives.
