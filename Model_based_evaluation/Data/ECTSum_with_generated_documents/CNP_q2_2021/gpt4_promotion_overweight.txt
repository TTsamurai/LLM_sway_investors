**CenterPoint Energy: A Strategic and Financial Bright Spot in the Utility Sector**

**Executive Summary**
CenterPoint Energy has demonstrated strong strategic execution and financial performance through the first half of 2021, signifying the company as an exceptional investment opportunity within the utility sector. Our recommendation is an 'overweight' position based on detailed operational improvements, strategic dispositions and realignments, and substantial growth in both earnings per share and rate base growth.

**Compelling Investment Highlights**

1. **Robust Financial Performance**: CenterPoint has outperformed expectations, raising its Utility EPS guidance range to $1.25 to $1.27. This represents an 8% growth projection for 2021, which is at the high end of the targeted annual growth rate of 6% to 8%. The company has maintained strong growth momentum despite an 18% increase in its share count in 2020, reflecting robust underlying financial health.

2. **Strategic Realignments and Asset Optimization**: Following a comprehensive strategic review, the company has heightened its focus on regulated business by increasing planned capital expenditure to $16 billion over five years, a 25% increase. This strategic shift is further supported by the divestiture of Arkansas and Oklahoma gas LDCs and a transformational merger involving Enable and Energy Transfer, effectively optimizing the asset portfolio and reducing midstream exposure.

3. **Commitment to Operational Excellence and Cost Management**: CenterPoint is not just focusing on expansion but is also deeply committed to improving operational efficiencies. The company has achieved significant O&M cost savings, totalling over $40 million for 2021 alone, and has committed to a 1% to 2% annual reduction in O&M costs over the next five years.

4. **Legislative and Regulatory Tailwinds**: Recent legislation in Texas and ongoing regulatory support provide CenterPoint with new opportunities for resilience and reliability investments, which are expected to further increase the utility's rate base growth. Additionally, the Natural Gas Innovation Act in Minnesota aligns with CenterPointâ€™s long-term sustainability and environmental goals, opening up avenues for innovative, clean energy investments.

5. **Leadership and Governance Refinements**: Under the new leadership of CEO Dave Lesar, the company has executed a dynamic transformation strategy. Recent changes to board leadership and governance structures are aimed at enhancing accountability and aligning with best practices, further bolstering investor confidence.

6. **Future Growth and Industry Positioning**: With the transitional and strategic initiatives yielding tangible results, CenterPoint is poised to solidify its standing as a premium utility in the U.S. The upcoming Analyst Day on September 23 will likely unveil further strategic updates, reinforcing CenterPoint's trajectory towards sustained growth and shareholder value creation.

**Conclusion**
CenterPoint Energy's aggressive and timely strategic realignments, coupled with robust financial performance and a favorable regulatory environment, position it exceptionally well for future growth. We recommend an 'overweight' investment stance, anticipating that the company will not only meet but potentially exceed its long-term financial and operational targets, thereby delivering significant value to investors.
