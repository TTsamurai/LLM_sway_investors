This strategy underscores management’s commitment to concentrating on high-growth areas like frozen and snack foods segments where Conagra continually captures market share and expands consumer bases.

#### Pioneering E-Commerce and Innovation
E-commerce remains a standout with sustained growth, now representing a larger percentage of total retail sales, accelerated by the COVID-19 context.
