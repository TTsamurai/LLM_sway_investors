**Conagra Brands Earnings Summary: Q2 Fiscal 2021**

**Investment Stance: Overweight**

**Introduction**
During the recent Q2 earnings call, Conagra Brands demonstrated exceptional financial performance, underpinned by the successful execution of strategic initiatives via the Conagra Way playbook. The company's adaptation to the pandemic and its prior transformations has fueled considerable growth and robust returns, leading us to recommend an overweight position.

**Key Financial Highlights**

- **Net Sales Growth:** Organic net sales increased by 8.1%, driven by significant growth across grocery and snacks, refrigerated and frozen, and international segments. This growth reflects strong consumer demand for at-home food consumption.

- **Operating Margins:** The adjusted operating margin expanded to 19.6%, a 250 basis point improvement. This increase was primarily attributed to strong supply chain productivity, favorable price mix, cost synergies from the Pinnacle Foods acquisition, and fixed cost leverage.

- **Earnings Per Share:** Adjusted EPS was reported at $0.81, marking a 28.6% increase from the previous year. This growth was fueled by higher operating profits and reduced net interest expenses, given the company's continued efforts in debt reduction.

- **Deleveraging:** Conagra reached its deleveraging targets ahead of schedule, with a Q2 net leverage ratio of 3.6 times, achieved through substantial debt reduction efforts totaling $2.3 billion since the acquisition of Pinnacle Foods.

- **Innovation and Market Penetration:** The company continues to innovate aggressively, with products launched in the past three years accounting for over 15% of annual retail sales. Brand performance has been strong, particularly in key areas like frozen single-serve meals and snacks.

**Strategic Execution and Future Outlook**

- **Portfolio Optimization:** Continued focus on reshaping the portfolio through targeted investments and divestitures, such as the recent agreement to sell Peter Pan Peanut Butter, supports long-term strategic priorities.

- **E-commerce Growth:** Investments in e-commerce have been fruitful, with Conagra outpacing the growth of total edibles in e-commerce each quarter since the pandemic's onset.

- **Innovation and Capacity Expansion:** The company is launching new products that cater to evolving consumer tastes and expanding production capacities, especially in the frozen vegetables and meals segments, to meet increasing demand.

- **Fiscal 2022 Guidance:** Conagra reaffirmed its fiscal 2022 outlook, anticipating continued strong performance backed by sustained consumer demand and strategic investments across its portfolio.

**Recommendation: Overweight Stance Justified**

Given Conagra's strong Q2 performance and successful strategic execution, coupled with robust sales growth, margin expansion, and effective leverage management, we maintain an overweight investment stance. The company is well-positioned to navigate the current market environment and capitalize on sustained trends in at-home consumption and e-commerce growth. Continuation of the Conagra Way playbook and agile adaptation to market conditions suggest promising prospects for sustainable long-term growth.

**Next Steps:**
Investors should look forward to updates at the next CAGNY presentation, which will likely provide further insights into ongoing strategic initiatives and detailed progress on the company's performance enhancement plans. We recommend closely monitoring the companyâ€™s execution against its outlined strategic imperatives and financial targets as the fiscal year progresses.
