**Gross Margin and Profitability**
- Gross margin showed a sequential improvement of 500 basis points from the first quarter, rising to over 20% in the current quarter.
- Gross profit, however, declined by $18 million due to higher per pound manufacturing and transportation costs.

**Outlook and Forecast**

- Pricing actions and cost mitigation strategies are set to manage ongoing challenges, including the impact of poor potato crop quality.

**Capital Expenditure and Shareholder Returns**
- Continued investment in capital projects, including expansions in American Falls, Idaho, and new lines in American Falls and China.
- A 4% increase in quarterly dividends and an additional $250 million authorized for share repurchases demonstrate confidence in financial strength and long-term business potential.

- Initiatives to manage through the poor potato crop, coupled with pricing actions, expected to help navigate costs and support sustainable profitable growth over the long term.
- Beginning the design phase of the second part of the new ERP system in the latter half of fiscal 2022, which will likely increase SG&A expenses.
