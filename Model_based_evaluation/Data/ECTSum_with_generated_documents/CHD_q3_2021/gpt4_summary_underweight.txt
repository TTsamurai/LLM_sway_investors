- **Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: Q3 EPS was $0.80, $0.10 above expectation. Full-year growth anticipated at 6%, against a 15% growth in 2020.

#### Challenges:

- **Labor and Transportation Difficulties**: Shortages and constraints have hindered production capabilities and impacted distribution networks.
- **Inflationary Pressures**: Substantial inflation across raw materials, packaging, labor, and transportation is compressing gross margins, with these conditions expected to persist into 2022.

#### Financial Health and Expenses:
- **Gross Margin**: Declined by 130 basis points year-over-year in Q3 to 44.2%, under previous expectations, largely due to Hurricane Ida's impact and inflationary pressures.
- **Marketing and SG&A**: Despite reduced marketing expenditures due to supply constraints, Q3 saw healthy marketing expenses at 12.3% of net sales, with expectations of 13% in Q4.
- **Cash Flow**: Operating cash flow decreased by 18% in the first nine months due to an increase in working capital, with full-year expectations around $950 million.

#### Strategic Responses:
- **Pricing Adjustments**: The company has raised prices on 50% of its portfolio and plans additional hikes on 30% starting Q1 2022.
- **Supply Chain Adjustments**: Efforts to enhance supply chain resilience include qualifying new suppliers and co-packers.
- **Capital Expenditure and Stock Repurchase**: Reduction in 2021 capex plans due to timing, with significant increases expected in 2022. A new $1 billion stock repurchase program was also announced.

#### Investment Stance â€“ Underweight:
- **Reason for Underweight Stance**: The ongoing supply chain issues, elevated inflation, and the substantial impact on gross margins pose significant risks. While the company is making operational adjustments and strategic price increases, the near to medium-term financial outlook remains pressured by external economic factors and internal constraints.
- **Market Risks**: Continued inflation and supply chain disruptions could further erode profitability and hamper operational efficiency despite strong brand performance.
- **Long-term Outlook Concerns**: While management actions to mitigate these headwinds appear robust, the persistent external challenges and heavy reliance on corrective pricing actions warrant caution. The expected impact on margins and potential for operational disruptions could adversely affect the stock performance in the short to medium term.

This report suggests an 'underweight' investment stance on Church & Dwight stock, reflecting heightened caution due to current operational and macroeconomic challenges impacting its financial health and future performance outlook.
