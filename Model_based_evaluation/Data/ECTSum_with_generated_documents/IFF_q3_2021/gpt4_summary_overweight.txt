### Executive Summary: IFF Earnings Conference Call Q3 2021

**Investment Stance: Overweight**

#### Key Financial Highlights and Metrics:

- **Sales Growth:** IFF reported sales of $8.6 billion for the first nine months of 2021, reflecting a 10% growth year-over-year, or 7% on a currency-neutral basis. This robust growth trajectory continues in Q3 with sales reaching approximately $3.1 billion, a 12% increase year-over-year, substantiating IFF’s dominant market position post its strategic merger with DuPont N&B.

- **Adjusted EBITDA Margin:** The Company maintained a healthy adjusted EBITDA margin of 22% year-to-date, although facing a slight compression in Q3 due to raw material and logistic cost inflations (gross margin down by 210 basis points).

- **Profitability:** Strategic pricing actions partly mitigated inflation impacts, evidenced by Q3 adjusted EBITDA growth of 4%. Overall, IFF expects modest EBITDA growth for the full year despite ongoing cost pressures.

- **Free Cash Flow:** Demonstrating strong operational efficiency, IFF generated $884 million in free cash flow through the nine months, indicating a resilient financial posture enabling it to meet its deleveraging targets.

- **Divestitures:** The completion of divesting non-core segments like the food preparation business enhances focus on the core segments, contributing to a streamlined operation poised for targeted growth areas.

#### Regional and Segment Performance:

- **Regional Sales:** Notably, all key regions displayed strong growth with Latin America leading (12% growth), followed by robust performances in North America, Asia, and EMEA regions, reflecting diversified strength across markets.

- **Business Segments:** The Nourish and Scent divisions have shown outperforming results with currency-neutral growth of 9% and 8% respectively, while Health & Bioscience and Pharma Solutions faced certain challenges owing to global supply chain disruptions.

#### Synergy Realization and Portfolio Optimization:

- **Synergies:** Approximately $40 million in cost synergies were achieved within the first nine months of 2021, nearing 90% of the 2021 target. IFF remains on a clear track to realize a 3-year run-rate cost synergy target of $300 million.

- **Strategic Divestitures and Acquisitions:** The transition through strategic divestitures is complementing the synergy realization efforts, aligning the business towards core growth-centric operations which are expected to drive long-term shareholder value.

#### Market and Future Outlook:

- **Inflationary Pressures and Strategy:** Management underscores significant ongoing inflationary pressures which will necessitate continued aggressive pricing strategies and operational adjustments to maintain margins and profitability.

- **Full Year 2021 Projections:** Revenue is projected at $11.55 billion representing 8.5% growth, with adjusted EBITDA margin expected to be slightly below 21%. The focus remains on combating inflationary pressures while driving top-line growth.

#### Strategic Executive Moves:

- **Leadership Transition:** The announcement of CEO Andreas Fibig’s planned departure in early 2022 and the integration of new CFO Glenn Richter is seen as a strategic move to usher in a new phase of leadership aimed at driving the next growth cycle.

### Analyst Recommendation:

- **Placement:** Overweight. Based on IFF’s robust Q3 performance, strategic realignment through divestitures, strong sales momentum across segments, and proactive management actions in response to inflationary pressures, an overweight stance is recommended as the company is better positioned to outperform the broader market with its integration synergies and fortified operational strategies.
