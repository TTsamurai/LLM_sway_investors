### Equity Research Report: IFF (Underweight Recommendation)

#### Company Overview:
International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. (IFF) is a global leader in the creation of flavors and fragrances used in a wide variety of consumer products and packaged goods. Despite the company's recent efforts to synergize operations following the merger with DuPont’s Nutrition & Biosciences (N&B) business, several challenges are likely to hamper both short and long-term performance.

#### Recent Performance and Strategic Initiatives:
IFF reported sales of $8.6 billion in the first nine months of 2021, showing promising growth numbers on the surface, with a 10% increase year-over-year and significant strides in its Nourish and Scent divisions. The company has been active in its portfolio optimization, shedding its food preparation and microbial control businesses to focus more intently on its core segments. These divestitures, while streamlining operations, have also introduced elements of transitional complexity and diverted resources from other potentially value-creating activities.

#### Challenges and Concerns:
1. **Inflationary Pressures and Cost Increases:** IFF has reported ongoing inflationary pressures, primarily due to higher raw material, logistics, and energy costs. Despite attempts to mitigate these through price increases and cost discipline, margins have been negatively impacted, as evidenced by the 210 basis points decrease in gross margin in Q3 2021. The company anticipates these pressures to continue which may further erode profitability.

2. **Integration Risks Post-Merger:** Despite positive developments from the merger, integration risks remain a significant concern. Achieving the targeted cost synergies of $45 million within this fiscal year is ambitious, given the operational and market complexity. Such integrations are resource-intensive and could divert focus from core business activities, impairing operational efficiency.

3. **Supply Chain Disruptions:** Global supply chain disruptions continue to impact the company’s ability to meet customer demand, particularly in the Pharma Solutions division. These disruptions contribute to supply shortages and increased costs, adversely affecting overall profitability and operational stability.

4. **Dependence on Key Divisions:** While the company has shown impressive growth in its Nourish and Scent segments, there is an overt reliance on these divisions for overall performance. Any downturn in these markets could disproportionately affect the company's financial health.

#### Financial Health:
IFF's leverage remains a concern, with gross debt reduced by $446 million yet still standing at a substantial $11.5 billion. Although IFF is progressing towards its deleveraging target, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA (4.1x) indicates a higher-than-ideal leverage that could constrain future financial flexibility. Moreover, the necessity to manage this debt in a rising-cost environment complicates financial management.

#### Outlook and Recommendation:
While IFF has demonstrated a capacity to drive top-line growth, the challenges of integrating a massive operation like N&B, coupled with ongoing inflationary pressures, present significant risks to profitability and operational efficiency. The supply chain vulnerabilities and heavy reliance on certain divisions further accentuate these risks.

Given these factors, coupled with the broader economic uncertainties and potential margin pressures, we assign an **Underweight** recommendation for IFF. We advise investors to maintain caution, monitoring the company's ability to manage integration successfully, control costs, and navigate the inflationary environment before reassessing its investment potential.
