   - **Life Sciences:** Marked a 24% increase in sales, driven by demand from the pandemic response and increasing traction in cell- and gene-based therapies.

   - **Specialty Materials:** Increased prominence of Gorilla Glass in consumer electronics continues to offer revenue potential. 

3. **Innovation and Partnerships:**
   - Introduction of new products like Velocity Vials in pharmaceutical packaging and advancements in glass and ceramic sciences make Corning a leader in material sciences. Product innovations are expected to drive higher sales volumes and improve gross margins.
   - Strategic partnerships, notably with AT&T and recent engagements with automotive companies like Daimler and Hyundai, leverage Corning’s specialized materials in new product applications.

4. **Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility:**
   - Corning continues to integrate sustainability into its business model, evidenced by its commitment to the Paris Agreement and local community support through COVID-19 initiatives.

**Outlook for 2022:**
