### Conference Call Summary: Conagra Brands

#### Key Financial Metrics and Performance Insights

1. **Net Sales and Growth:** 
   - Q2 organic net sales grew by more than 5% (on a two-year CAGR basis) due to strong consumer demand, favorable pricing actions, and lower-than-expected price elasticity. Q2 saw an overall organic net sales increase of 2.6% compared to the prior year, mostly driven by increased prices and favorable brand mix.

2. **Earnings Per Share:**
   - Adjusted EPS for Q2 increased by nearly 1% on a two-year CAGR basis. Despite inflationary pressures and investment in the supply chain to meet demand, Conagra reaffirmed its full-year adjusted EPS outlook at approximately $2.50.

3. **Margins:**
   - Margins faced pressure due to unexpected high inflation, additional transitory supply chain costs, and strategic investments to fulfill consumer demand. Gross margin declined by 483 basis points in Q2, primarily due to significant input cost inflation and strategic order servicing costs.
   - Adjusted operating margin guidance slightly reduced to approximately 15.5%, from 16%, reflecting increased gross inflation expectations for the year.

4. **Pricing Actions:**
   - Conagra implemented several pricing actions in response to inflation, which are expected to have a more pronounced effect in Q4. Price elasticity has remained lower than anticipated, indicating continued consumer preference for value despite price increases.

5. **Supply Chain and Investments:**
   - Responses to supply chain challenges included utilizing third-party transportation and warehousing to improve product availability and delaying certain productivity programs to maximize production.

6. **Consumer Trends and Demographics:**
   - Conagra noted a structural shift in consumer behavior, with a more pronounced move towards at-home eating among younger consumers (Millennials and Gen Z). These demographic groups are showing high penetration and repeat rates, positively impacting long-term brand loyalty and value creation.

7. **E-commerce and Innovation:**
   - Strong growth in e-commerce continued, outpacing competitors in the total editable category. Innovation remains a critical success factor, with new products and modernization initiatives resonating well with consumers.

8. **Guidance Updates:**
   - Organic net sales guidance increased to approximately 3% up from 1% previously anticipated. Gross inflation expectations were revised upward to approximately 14% from 11%.
   - The company expects to end the year with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of around 3.7 to 3.8 times, with a strong focus on generating robust free cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year.

#### Conclusion:
Despite facing significant inflationary challenges and supply chain disruptions, Conagra Brands has managed to sustain growth through strategic price adjustments, strong brand performance, and effective demand fulfillment strategies. The reaffirmed earnings guidance and adjusted financial outlook reflect resilience and adaptive measures that align with evolving consumer preferences and market dynamics. Continued efforts in e-commerce and innovation tailored to younger consumer segments further position Conagra for sustainable long-term growth.
