**Edwards Lifesciences Q3 2021 Earnings Summary: Overweight Investment Stance**

**Key Financial Metrics and Highlights:**

1. **Sales Performance:**
   - Total company sales reached $1.3 billion in Q3, marking a 14% increase on a constant-currency basis year-over-year. This growth, although robust, was slightly under the July expectations primarily due to the impact of the Delta variant on U.S. hospitals.
   - TAVR (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement) global sales stood at $508 million, exhibiting a 14% rise on an underlying basis compared to the same period last year. The U.S. experienced a 12% increase in TAVR sales, displaying stable market share amidst varied geographical and hospital impacts due to COVID-19.
   - Surgical Structural Heart sales grew by 6% on an underlying basis to $217 million, driven by increasing adoption of Edwards' premium technologies.
   - Critical Care sector reported a significant 17% rise in sales to $213 million, bolstered by strong demand across all product lines, notably HemoSphere capital sales in the U.S.

2. **Growth and Market Expansion:**
   - The company projects continued high-teens sales growth for the full year. 
   - Edwards remains optimistic about the broader international adoption of TAVR and predicts the global TAVR market to exceed $7 billion by 2024, fueled by low double-digit compound annual growth rates.
   - For the TMTT (Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies) unit, sales of $22 million were driven by positive adoptive rates, especially in Europe. The full-year guidance for this unit remains at $80 million to $100 million, with expectations for the market to triple by 2025.

3. **Operational and Strategic Developments:**
   - Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, the company experienced continuous strong adoption and favorable clinical outcomes across its innovative platforms. Particularly, the international resilience of TAVR amidst pandemic disruptions was noted.
   - Edwards is progressing with five pivotal trials across its portfolio, especially focusing on expanding indications for mitral and tricuspid regurgitation therapies.

4. **Financial Health and Guidance:**
   - Adjusted gross profit margin improved to 76.3% from 75.5% in the prior year, driven by a profitable mix offset slightly by negative foreign exchange impacts.
   - SG&A expenses rose due to increased personnel costs and commercial activities, and R&D expenses grew by 22% due to heightened clinical trial activity.
   - Full-year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance is affirmed at the high-end of $2.07 to $2.27, reflecting strong operational performance and managed expenses.
   
5. **Investor Insights and Forward Outlook:**
   - Q4 sales are expected to range between $1.30 billion and $1.38 billion, with anticipated continued stability in earnings.
   - A detailed 2022 financial guidance will be provided during the December 8 Investor Conference, focusing on less COVID disruption and resuming normalized growth.
