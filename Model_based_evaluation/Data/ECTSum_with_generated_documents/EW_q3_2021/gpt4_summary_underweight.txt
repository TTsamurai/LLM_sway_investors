### Summary Report: Edwards Lifesciences Q3 2021 Earnings Conference - Underweight Stance

#### Key Financial Metrics

1. **Total Company Sales:**
   - Q3 2021 sales were $1.3 billion, reflecting a 14% increase on a constant-currency basis year-over-year. This growth, however, fell short of July expectations due to challenges related to the COVID-19 Delta variant impacting U.S. hospitals.

2. **Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR):**
   - Global sales for TAVR were $508 million, marking a 14% increase on an underlying basis compared to the previous year. U.S. sales grew by 12% year-over-year.

3. **Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies (TMTT):**
   - Global sales were $22 million, primarily driven by the uptake of PASCAL in Europe. The company maintains full-year guidance expecting sales between $80 million to $100 million.

4. **Surgical Structural Heart:**
   - Posted a 6% underlying growth yielding $217 million in sales. Despite COVID-19 resurgence, there was noticeable growth in SABR procedures.

5. **Critical Care:**
   - Sales totaled $213 million, up 17% on an underlying basis, with robust capital sales of the HemoSphere device in the U.S.

6. **Gross Profit Margin:**
   - Adjusted gross profit margin was 76.3%, an increase from 75.5% in the prior year. This was aided by a more profitable product mix and moderated by minimal net impacts from inflation and foreign exchange.

7. **Operating Expenses:**
   - SG&A expenses were $364 million, or 27.8% of sales, up from the previous year due to increased personnel and commercial activities.
   - R&D expenses increased by 22% to $238 million due to heightened clinical trial activities.

8. **Earnings Per Share (EPS):**
   - Reported EPS for Q3 was $0.54, aligning with expectations. The full-year adjusted EPS guidance remains at the high-end of $2.07 to $2.27.

9. **Cash Flow and Capital Allocation:**
   - Q3 free cash flow was robust at $471 million. The company continues to maintain a strong balance sheet with approximately $3 billion in cash and investments.
   - Approximately $1.2 billion remains available under the share repurchase program.

#### Investment Outlook and Risks

- **Underweight Recommendation:** While Edwards Lifesciences demonstrated resilience in some segments, there are troubling signs warranting caution:
  - The impact of the Delta variant has led to deferred procedures, particularly in the U.S., potentially dampening near-term revenue expectations.
  - Increased operating expenses culminating from heightened commercial and clinical activities are likely to pressure profitability in the short term.
  - Inflationary pressures, though modestly impacting the gross margin now, could pose greater risks if prolonged or intensified.

- **Risks to Consider:**
  - Resurgence of COVID-19 cases or new variants could lead to further procedural deferrals and operational disruptions.
  - Competitive pressures in the TAVR market, particularly in international markets, could impact market share and pricing stability.
  - Regulatory and reimbursement landscape changes remain uncertain, particularly with evolving clinical guidelines and health policies.

#### Forward-Looking Statements

- Edwards Lifesciences expects less disruption from COVID in 2022, aiming for normalized sales and earnings growth. Detailed guidance will be provided at the December 8 investor conference. Nevertheless, investors should maintain vigilance on the evolving market dynamics and potential headwinds impacting the companyâ€™s performance sectors.

This report recommends maintaining an 'underweight' stance on Edwards Lifesciences until clearer signs of sustained recovery and operational stability are evident.
