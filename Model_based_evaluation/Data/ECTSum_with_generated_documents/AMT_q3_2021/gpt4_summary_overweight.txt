4. **Leverage and Liquidity**: The company continued to maintain a robust balance sheet, ending the quarter with net leverage of 4.9 times, attributable to strategic financing activities including raising approximately $3 billion through senior unsecured notes.

5. **Capital Deployment**: AMT remains committed to driving shareholder returns, with significant capital directed towards growth-oriented investments, including the ongoing construction of new sites primarily in international markets.

### Strategic Developments

The company's ongoing investments in renewable energy sources like solar power align with its long-term strategy to mitigate environmental impact and bolster operational efficiencies.

The companyâ€™s resilient business model, coupled with its advantageous position to capitalize on global digital transformation trends such as 5G, IoT, and edge computing, provides a solid foundation for sustained growth. Continued investment in both developed and emerging markets, strategic capital deployment, and a robust balance sheet further reinforce AMT's potential for superior total returns for shareholders.
