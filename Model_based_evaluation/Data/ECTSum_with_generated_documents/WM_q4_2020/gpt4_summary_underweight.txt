# Waste Management (WM) Earnings Conference Call Summary â€“ Underweight Investment Stance

## Key Financial Metrics and Analysis:

### Operating EBITDA and Margins:
- The company continued to show strong performance in Q4 2020 with an operating EBITDA of $1 billion, maintaining a consistent high performance for the seventh consecutive quarter.
- Q4 operating EBITDA exceeded Q4 2019, showing a 4% growth when adjusting for the $38 million contribution from Advanced Disposal Services (ADS) and a $60 million fuel tax credit benefit in Q4 2019.
- Full-year 2020 operating EBITDA margin reached 28.4%, with an exclusion of ADS contributions, pushing margins slightly over 28.5%.

### Financial Stability and Cost Management:
- Operating costs were noted to be 61.5% of revenue in Q4, seeing a rise from 60.2% in Q4 2019. This was influenced partly by the ADS integration.
- WM demonstrated effective cost control measures, reducing SG&A costs by $56 million in 2020, now representing 10.2% of revenue.

### Revenue and Pricing:
- WM reported moderate revenue growth, with expectations to improve as pandemic impacts lessen.
- Adjusted for lower volumes, core price growth was 3.8%. Consistent pricing discipline was observed in landfill and transfer station core prices, both rising over 3%.

### Capital Expenditure and Free Cash Flow:
- Capital spending was $1.632 billion for 2020, showing disciplined reduction due to pandemic-related volume declines.
- Free cash flow was a robust $2.656 billion, influenced significantly by the ADS transaction.

### Debt and Liquidity:
- Total debt-to-EBITDA stood at 3.19 times in Q4, with a target to bring this within 2.5 to 3 times during 2021.
- The company expects cash interest savings of more than $90 million in 2021 following a strategic refinancing move.

### ADS Integration and Synergies:
- Integration of ADS is progressing well with expected synergies between $60 million and $75 million for 2021.
- About one-third of these synergies are expected from optimizing routes starting from Q2 2021.

### Sustainability and Investment in Technology:
- Heavy investment in Customer Service Digitalization (CSD) to enhance service and efficiency.
- WM remains committed to ESG initiatives with reinforced investments in recycling technologies and renewable natural gas facilities, expected to deliver strong returns.

## Concerns and Rationale for 'Underweight' Stance:
- While the company demonstrates robust revenue growth and strong operational performance, the increasing operating costs and ongoing expenses related to ADS integration might pose financial risks.
- The ambitious integration and synergy targets with ADS could lead to integration risks affecting short-term financial performance.
- Heavy capital expenditure plans in technology and ESG initiatives, although potentially beneficial long-term, might stress financial resources and impact immediate profitability.
- The high debt levels and obligation to bring down the debt-to-EBITDA ratio could limit financial flexibility.

### Conclusion:
Given the current uncertainties around integration and high expenditure that may weigh on near-term financials, coupled with the operational risks, an 'underweight' investment stance is advised until clearer signs of efficient integration and cost management are visible. This cautionary stance allows investors to monitor how successfully WM can convert its strategic investments and ADS synergies into a sustainable improvement in margins and returns.
