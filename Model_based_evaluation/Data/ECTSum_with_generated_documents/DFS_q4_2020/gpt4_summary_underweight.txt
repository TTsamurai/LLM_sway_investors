#### **Adopting an 'Underweight' Investment Stance**

Despite Discover’s strong operational adjustments and credit performance in 2020, the decision to adopt an 'underweight' stance is predicated on several factors:
- **Revenue Pressure:** Persistent lower consumer spending and tighter credit conditions that have led to a decline in overall revenue.
- **Economic Uncertainty:** High levels of economic uncertainty and anticipated deterioration in credit performance that might affect profitability in upcoming periods.
- **Loan Growth Concerns:** Continued suppression in loan growth could limit revenue potential moving forward, especially as consumer behavior and economic recovery remain unpredictable.

Overall, Discover has showcased resilient operational and financial handling amid challenges. However, given the potential headwinds and market volatility, a cautious approach is advised for the investors. Continued monitoring of economic indicators and company performance will be crucial in reassessing this stance.
