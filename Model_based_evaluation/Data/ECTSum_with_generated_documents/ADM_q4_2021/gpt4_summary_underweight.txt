### Dividends and Shareholder Value

### Key Financial Metrics Concerns:
- **Effective Tax Rate**: Increased to 21% in Q4 2021 from 8% in Q4 2020. Full-year rate adjusted from 5% in 2020 to 17% in 2021. Anticipated to be 16-19% in 2022. The rise in tax rate weakens net profitability.
- **Net Interest Expense**: Increased due to higher short-term borrowings, impacting financial flexibility and increasing debt service costs.
- **Liquidity and Debt**: Net debt-to-total capital ratio at ~28%. High liquidity at approx $9 billion, but the monitoring of capital allocation remains crucial.

### Outlook and Future Projections
- **Ag Services and Oilseeds**: Potential for similar or better OP than 2021 amid a favorable demand environment.
- **Carbohydrate Solutions**: Anticipated full-year OP slightly lower than 2021 despite positive industry ethanol outlook.
- **Nutrition**: Forecasted 15+ percent OP growth and revenue growth above 10% for 2022.

### Investment Considerations: Underweight Stance
- **High Dependence on Commodity Markets**: The companyâ€™s significant exposure to volatile agricultural commodity markets could impact financial stability and predictability.
- **Rising Input Costs**: Increases in energy and input costs could squeeze margins, particularly noted in the Carbohydrate Solutions segment.
- **Regulatory and Tax Pressures**: Increased effective tax rates and regulatory uncertainties surrounding environmental impacts and trade could affect profitability.
- **Economic Sensitivity**: The business segments are sensitive to global economic conditions, adding an element of risk in times of economic downturn or instability.

### Conclusion
Considering the outlined financial metrics, operational challenges, and market dependencies, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended. Investors should closely monitor the company's adjustments to tax burdens, input costs, and regulatory challenges, alongside implemented strategies to mitigate these risks without compromising growth trajectory and shareholder returns.
