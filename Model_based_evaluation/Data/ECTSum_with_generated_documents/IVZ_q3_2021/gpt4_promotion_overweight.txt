Over the last five quarters, Invesco has achieved a remarkable average quarterly organic growth rate of 6%, driven by high client engagement and strategic investment in response to evolving market demands.

### **Strategic Focus Areas and Financial Outcomes**

#### **Dynamic Portfolio Expansion**
Invesco continues to strengthen its portfolio offerings, focusing on areas with high growth potential:
- **ETFs and Passive Incomes**: With net long-term inflows amounting to $13.3 billion in the latest quarter, Invesco's annualized organic growth rate stands at 4.4%. The ETFs, excluding the QQQ series, brought in significant inflows of $3.7 billion, highlighting effective market share capture.
- **Alternatives and Private Markets**: Demonstrating versatility, Invesco reported substantial inflows into direct real estate and newly launched CLO products. Net long-term inflows in alternatives were robust, totaling $2.3 billion.
- **Active Fixed Income and Global Equities**: A key strategic area, active fixed income accounted for net long-term inflows of $11 billion. Invesco remains a leader in developing markets through products inherited from Oppenheimer, attracting significant investments totaling $700 million.

#### **Global Reach and Institutional Strength**
Invesco’s international influence, especially in lucrative markets like China, continues to thrive. The third quarter witnessed net inflows of $6.8 billion from Greater China, powered by Invesco's early market entry and sophisticated local capabilities. Invesco’s JV in China positions it uniquely among global asset managers, offering considerable advantage as the Chinese investment management industry grows.

### **Financial Stability and Prospects**
Invesco’s financial health is encouraging, with a reported total AUM of $1.529 trillion by the end of the third quarter, evidencing modest growth amidst market volatility. The strategic reallocation of resources and cost management initiatives have led to improved cash positions, enhancing Invesco’s capability to invest strategically and buffer against market swings.
