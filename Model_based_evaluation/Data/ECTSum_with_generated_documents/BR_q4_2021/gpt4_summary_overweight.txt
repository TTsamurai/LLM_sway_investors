### Executive Summary

#### Investment Stance: Overweight

Broadridge Financial Solutions showcased impressive financial results in fiscal year 2021 and provided a strong outlook for fiscal year 2022, underscoring robust growth across its core segments: Governance, Capital Markets, and Wealth & Investment Management. The company’s strategic acquisitions and increased focus on digital transformation and innovative technologies have positioned it well for sustained growth. The significant expansion in recurring revenue, alongside margin improvements and strategic investments, presents a compelling case for adopting an overweight investment stance.

### Key Financial Highlights

- **Recurring Revenue Growth:** Broadridge reported a 10% increase in recurring revenues to $3.3 billion in FY21, driven by robust performance in both the Investor Communication Solutions (ICS) and Global Technology and Operations (GTO) segments. The company projects recurring revenue growth of 12% to 15% for FY22.

- **Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS):** Adjusted EPS rose by 13% to $5.66 in FY21, reflecting the company's efficient cost management and revenue growth. Adjustments were largely attributable to strategic investments. For FY22, Broadridge forecasts an 11% to 15% increase in adjusted EPS.

- **Strategic Acquisitions:** The acquisition of Itiviti, completed in May of FY21 for $2.6 billion, represents Broadridge’s largest acquisition to date, enhancing its capabilities in Capital Markets. Alongside the tuck-in acquisitions of AdvisorStream and other assets, these strategic moves are expected to contribute positively to the company’s revenue streams going forward.

- **Capital Allocation:** In FY21, Broadridge returned nearly $250 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The Board approved an 11% increase in the annual dividend, marking consistent double-digit dividend growth over the last nine years.

- **Innovation and Technology Investment:** Investment in new technologies, such as AI and Digital Ledger Technology (DLT), continues to propel Broadridge’s competitive edge. Notable developments include the LTX fixed income platform and the Digital Ledger Repo platform, which are set to capture significant market share in their respective domains.

### Strategic Outlook and Growth Drivers

- **Governance Segment:** Broadridge continues to capitalize on its strong position in the governance network, marked by 11% growth in ICS recurring revenue driven by innovations and strength in regulatory solutions. The continued adoption of virtual shareholder meeting technologies and the expansion of global governance solutions remain key growth drivers.

- **Capital Markets:** With an 8% growth driven by new client additions and the Itiviti integration, this segment is positioned for further expansion. Broadridge’s strategy focuses on leveraging advanced technologies to enhance client solutions in trading and post-trade services.

- **Wealth & Investment Management:** This segment saw a 6% revenue growth, primarily from new sales and digital transformation initiatives. Broadridge’s partnership with UBS on its North America Wealth Management transformation and the new client addition of RBC Wealth Management highlight the segment's strong growth potential.

### Fiscal Year 2022 Guidance

- Broadridge is optimistic about continuing its momentum into FY22, with guidance suggesting further growth in revenue and earnings. The company targets recurring revenue growth between 12% and 15%, coupled with an adjusted operating income margin expansion to about 19%. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow by 11% to 15%. 

### Conclusion

Broadridge’s robust financial performance, combined with proactive strategic initiatives and solid growth prospects, underpins the rationale for an 'overweight' investment stance. The company’s focus on embracing digital transformation and expanding its global reach through strategic acquisitions and technology investments further enhances its competitive position and attractiveness as an investment opportunity. Investors are advised to focus on the long-term growth trajectory supported by high client retention rates, strong sales backlog, and continuous innovations.
