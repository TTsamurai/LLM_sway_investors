  - 11% to 15% growth in adjusted earnings per share
  - Another year of record sales

**Risks and Investment Stance:**
- **Underweight Stance:** Despite strong financial performance and strategic positioning in growth sectors, the investment stance is recommended as underweight due to potential risks including:
  - High levels of capital investments and acquisitions that may affect short-term profitability.
  - Leveraged balance sheet post-acquisition spree, particularly the $2.6 billion acquisition of Itiviti, which significantly increased debt levels.
  - Potential disruptions in global financial markets which could affect trading volumes and capital market operations.
  - Dependence on the seamless integration and performance of newly acquired companies.
  - Regulatory changes affecting key business operations in international markets.

**Conclusion:**
Broadridge displays a strong operational performance with successful strategic moves enhancing long-term growth prospects. However, given the current financial leverage and substantial investments directing towards long-term gains, a conservative underweight stance is recommended to mitigate potential short-term financial market variability and integration risks from recent acquisitions.
