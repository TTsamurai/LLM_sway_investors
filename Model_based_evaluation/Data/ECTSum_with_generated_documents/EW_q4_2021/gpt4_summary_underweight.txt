### Summary Report: Edwards Earnings Conference Call - Fourth Quarter 2021

**Investment Stance: Underweight**

#### Key Financial Metrics and Observations:
- **Sales Performance:**
  - **Total Sales**: Achieved $5.2 billion, reflecting an underlying growth of 18% year-over-year.
  - **TAVR Sales**: $3.4 billion with 18% underlying growth for the full year; Q4 sales were $872 million, up 13%. Despite this growth, impacted by hospital resource limitations due to the Omicron variant.
  - **Surgical Structural Heart Sales**: $889 million for the full year, up 15% year-over-year.
  - **Critical Care**: Grew to $835 million, up 14% year-over-year.
  - **TMTT Sales**: $86 million for the full year, with Q4 revenue at $25 million.

- **Profitability Concerns**:
  - **Adjusted Earnings Per Share**: Increased by 19% to $2.22, but Q4 earnings were negatively affected by unanticipated spending shifts and weaker-than-expected sales.
  - **Gross Profit Margin**: Improved to 76.8% in Q4 due to favorable foreign exchange impacts, but concerns remain about ongoing investment needs in manufacturing.
  - **SG&A Expenses**: Rose significantly to 31.9% of sales in Q4, driven by personnel costs and resumed commercial activities.
  - **R&D Expenses**: Marked a 19% increase to $233 million in Q4, underlining heavy investment in innovation but raising cost concerns.

- **Cash Flow and Capital Allocation**:
  - **Free Cash Flow**: Strong performance with $1.4 billion for the full year, though anticipated reduction in 2022 due to changes in tax regulations involving R&D expense deductions.
  - **Share Repurchases**: Continued with $100 million in buybacks in Q4; however, ongoing capital returns could be reassessed given financial commitments and investment needs.

- **Market Conditions and Risks**:
  - Impacts of the COVID-19 Omicron variant noticeably skewed hospital resources and procedural volumes, mainly in December, suggesting potential vulnerability to further pandemic-related disruptions.
  - Geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties, including foreign exchange fluctuations which had a slight negative impact on Q4 sales but helped gross margins.

- **Guidance for 2022**:
  - Provides for modest optimism with expectations of low double-digit sales growth, but contingent upon the stabilization of hospital operations post-Omicron impact.
  - Adjusted EPS forecasted at $2.50 to $2.65, implicative of management confidence but requires clear execution amid ongoing global pressures.

#### Conclusion:
Given the observation of pronounced cost pressures, dependence on continued procedural volume recovery, and significant investment outlays amid uncertain macroeconomic and pandemic-related challenges, an underweight stance is recommended. This cautious approach acknowledges Edwards' robust sales growth and market position but also considers the elevated operational and market risks that could affect future profitability and cash flow sustainability. Further monitoring of hospital resource normalization and execution of strategic initiatives, especially in TAVR and TMTT segments, will be crucial.
