**Investment Stance: Underweight on Royal Caribbean Group (RCL)**

**1. Ongoing Financial Vulnerability:**

Despite the optimistic tone about resumption and strong bookings for 2022, Royal Caribbean still faces significant financial headwinds. The continued mention of painful financial results, with a notable Q2 loss, underlines persistent volatility and risk. The management’s admission of a “never-ending roller coaster of ups and downs” raises questions about the company's financial resilience in the face of potential further disruptions or prolonged recoveries, particularly highlighted by a heavy schedule of debt maturities: $21 million for the remainder of this year and $2.2 billion for 2022. Notwithstanding the reduction of some higher-cost secured debt, the balance sheet remains pressured.

**2. Operational Risks and COVID-19 Challenges:**

While RCL has made commendable progress in implementing rigorous safety protocols, the threat posed by the COVID-19, particularly with variants such as Delta, remains a significant risk. The need for enhanced protocols may introduce additional operational costs and complexity. There is also the possibility of government-imposed restrictions re-emerging, which have historically led to substantial disruptions in operations.

**3. Elevated Competitive Pressure:**

As the travel sector rebounds, competition within the cruise industry and broader travel alternatives may intensify. Royal Caribbean mentions strong bookings and a high level of consideration among both active cruisers and non-cruisers, suggesting a potential post-pandemic surge in demand. However, this demand might be met with aggressive marketing and capacity expansion by competitors, potentially leading to price wars or higher customer acquisition costs.

**4. Long-term Industry Perception Shifts:**

The pandemic may have durably altered consumer behavior regarding cruise vacations. Despite high current bookings, the long-term perception of cruising safety, especially among new or hesitant travelers, could weaken, impacting future demand growth. Moreover, the environmental impact of cruising remains a concern, which could align with a broader consumer shift towards more sustainable travel options, notwithstanding the company's efforts to enhance its environmental credentials.

**5. Delayed Return to Normalcy:**

Management’s caution about the return to full operational normalcy, including the uncertain timing of full fleet resumption and low initial load factors, suggests that Royal Caribbean’s road to recovery could be longer and more fraught than anticipated. The slow ramp-up could affect cash flow and delay financial recovery, making it essential for investors to consider tighter liquidity and the impact on profitability from potentially reduced economies of scale.

**6. Investment in Future Operations:**

Investor capital is crucial for Royal Caribbean as they navigate through their restart. The commitment to substantial investments in safety, health, and environmental sustainability may strain cash reserves unless offset by robust revenue streams. This financial outlay raises concerns about the immediate return on investment and the broader strategic financial management under persistent adverse conditions.

**Conclusion:**

Given the ongoing uncertainties, operational challenges, and financial strain narrated in the latest earnings call, our investment stance for Royal Caribbean is currently rated as 'Underweight'. While there are certainly potential upsides from a successful industry rebound, the inherent risks at this stage warrant a cautious approach until clearer signs of stable financial performance and operational normalcy emerge. Investors are advised to closely monitor the evolving situation and adjust their positions accordingly.
