#### Forward-Looking Statements and Concerns

- Church & Dwight expressed confidence in sustaining strong sales growth, with an expected full-year sales growth of approximately 9% to 10% and organic sales growth of 7% to 8%. 
- Despite robust first-half performance, the company anticipates a contraction in gross margins in the latter half of the year due to acquisition impacts, COVID-related costs, and investments in capacity expansion and new product support.
- The company is redirecting some promotional and advertising expenditures from H1 to H2 2020 to support new product launches, which indicates a strategic shift but could also complicate earnings predictability in the near term.

#### Recommendations

Given the analysis, the recommendation is to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on Church & Dwight for the following reasons:

- **High Valuation Relative to Earnings Growth**: Despite positive performance metrics, the projected earnings growth might not justify the current valuation, especially considering the expected flat EPS in H2 2020.

- **Margin Pressures**: The anticipated contraction in gross margins due to various aforementioned factors could strain profitability in the upcoming quarters.

- **Increased Operational Costs**: Investments in new logistics, storage, engineering, and outsourcing may elevate operational costs, potentially impacting the bottom line if sales growth does not exceed these cost increases substantially.

- **Market Uncertainties and Consumer Behavior**: The ongoing pandemic presents a volatile market environment, and shifts in consumer behavior could impact sales unpredictably, particularly if new waves of the virus affect the economy and mobility.

- **Dependence on New Product Success**: A significant part of the company's strategy revolves around new product launches. These products need to perform exceedingly well to counterbalance increased costs and support the overall profitability frame.

#### Conclusion
While Church & Dwight has shown strong performance during the first half of 2020, future uncertainties regarding cost management, margin pressures, and market conditions suggest a cautious approach. Investors are advised to maintain an underweight position until clearer signs of sustained profitability and margin improvements emerge post H2 2020.
