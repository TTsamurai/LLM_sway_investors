**Norfolk Southern: Positioned for Progressive Growth and Unmatched Value Creation**

**Executive Summary**

Norfolk Southern stands at a pivotal moment, poised to leverage strategic operational advancements and financial strength developed over recent years. Following a rigorous review of our fourth-quarter and full-year performance for 2021, we are confident in recommending Norfolk Southern as an 'overweight' investment. The company has demonstrated resilience and innovation, achieving remarkable financial outcomes and operational efficiencies despite global challenges.

**Robust Financial Performance**

In 2021, Norfolk Southern achieved a 14% increase in revenues, resulting in $11.1 billion, driven by a balanced growth across all markets. Notably, our operating ratio improved by 430 basis points to a record 60%, reflecting our ability to manage expenses effectively while scaling operations. This figure stands as a testament to our strategic planning and execution, particularly under the pressures of a global pandemic and fluctuating market demands.

**Operational Excellence**

Implementing the Thoroughbred Operating Plan (TOP SPG), Norfolk Southern has made substantial gains in service quality, productivity, and growth capabilities. We've seen a strategic reduction in crew starts and an increase in train length and weight, which enhance fuel efficiency and reduce operational costs. Innovations such as the DC to AC locomotive modernization program have furthered our operational capabilities, enabling us to handle increased volume without compromising service quality.

**Strategic Market Positioning**

Norfolk Southern's diverse business lines—from chemicals and metals to coal and intermodal services—show robust demand and pricing power, even amid global supply chain disruptions. For instance, our coal revenue increased by 21% in the fourth quarter alone, driven by high seaborne coal prices. Our merchandise and intermodal segments also recorded substantial gains, positioning us to capitalize on economic recovery trends and sustained consumer demand.

**Favorable Outlook for 2022**

Looking ahead, Norfolk Southern is strategically positioned to navigate and capitalize on the evolving economic landscape. With projected growth in industrial production and construction spending, along with anticipated improvements in supply chain dynamics, we expect continued revenue growth and operational efficiency. Our innovative hiring strategies and workforce optimization plans are set to further enhance our service capabilities, ensuring we meet the dynamic needs of our customers.

**Commitment to Shareholders**

Norfolk Southern has returned nearly $10 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends over the past three years, underscoring our commitment to shareholder value. The planned dividend payout ratio of 35% to 40%, coupled with sensible capital expenditures, underscores our balanced approach to growth and shareholder returns.

**Conclusion**

As Norfolk Southern continues to excel in operational performance and financial health, our strategic initiatives are set to foster sustainable long-term growth. We recommend an 'overweight' stance on Norfolk Southern, anticipating significant returns driven by robust operational metrics, strategic market positioning, and steadfast commitments to efficiency and profitability.
