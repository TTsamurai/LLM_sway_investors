## Investment Rationale Supporting 'Overweight' Stance

### Strong Product Pipeline
The continued innovation and launch of new products such as Simparica Trio and the expansion of major vaccine franchises (e.g., Vanguard B Oral) demonstrate a robust pipeline that not only meets current market needs but also diversifies the revenue base.

### Shift Towards Companion Animals
With a significant 13% growth in companion animal products, driven by new and existing treatments, Zoetis is well-positioned to benefit from the higher spending trends on pet health spurred by increased pet ownership and health consciousness among pet owners during the pandemic.

### Resilient Operational Structure
Despite the global disruptions caused by COVID-19, Zoetis showcased the strength and resilience of its supply chain and operational capabilities. The ability to maintain a steady supply of critical medicines and adapt quickly to changing market conditions stands as a testament to its robust operational framework.

### Future Growth Opportunities
The expansion in diagnostic and digital capabilities, such as the upcoming launch of VetScan Imagyst, and strategic acquisitions like Fish Vet Group, position Zoetis at the forefront of growth in veterinary diagnostics and continue to open new avenues for expansion.

### Financial Health
Zoetis reported a healthy liquidity position with approximately $3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents and a strong commitment to returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

## Risks and Considerations
While the outlook is positive, there are risks, including further disruptions from COVID-19, shifts in consumer spending behaviors, and exchange rate volatility. However, the companyâ€™s diverse geographic and product portfolio, along with a strong balance sheet, provides a cushion against these potential adverse effects.

## Conclusion
Given Zoetis's strong Q2 performance, robust growth in the companion animal segment, continuous product innovation, and solid financial position, maintaining an 'overweight' stance is recommended. The company's strategic initiatives and operational resilience underline its capability to outperform in the prevailing uncertain market environment, making it a compelling investment opportunity in the animal health sector.
