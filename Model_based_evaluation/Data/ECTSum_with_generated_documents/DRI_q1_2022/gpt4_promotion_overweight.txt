4. **Robust Supply Chain and Pricing Strategy:**
   - The company managed elevated inflation effectively by leveraging its significant scale and strategic pricing, maintaining continuity in operations and mitigating cost increases.
   - Darden’s strategic pricing has been successful in remaining below inflation, thus strengthening its value proposition amid higher industry-wide costs.

5. **Strong Workforce Management:**
   - Focused talent acquisition strategies have resulted in staffing levels reaching approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels.
   - Investments in workforce development and retention are evident, underscoring a robust operational framework that supports its expansive scale.

   - EBITDA projected between $1.54 billion and $1.60 billion.
   - Continued margin expansion despite anticipated inflation pressures.
