This uptick is primarily attributed to high tower activity levels linked to the nationwide 5G rollout.

- **Small Cells and Fiber Solutions**: Despite delays in small cell deployment due to zoning and permitting challenges, the long-term outlook remains positive. The company is strategically positioning its infrastructure to meet escalating data demands and network densification required for 5G.
- **Capital Expenditure and Investment Yield**: Crown Castle continues to aggressively invest in both towers and fiber, with second-quarter capital expenditures of $308 million. Investments are yielding substantial returns, most notably an 11% yield on invested capital from tower assets and incremental yields from fiber solutions and small cells.

- **Sustainability and Cost Efficiency**: Innovative adjustments to the credit facility incorporating sustainability targets and lower interest rates underscore a strong commitment to ESG principles, which are anticipated to drive cost efficiencies and enhance stakeholder value.

### Growth Outlook
- **Dividend Growth**: The compounded annual growth rate of the dividend per share stands at 9% since 2017, spotlighting the company’s ability to consistently deliver shareholder returns through a diversified strategy.
- **Continued Investment in Growth**: The ongoing investments in critical infrastructure for 5G deployment are expected to further fuel growth in AFFO and dividends, sustaining an attractive total return perspective for investors.

### Conclusion
Crown Castle’s exemplary performance in the second quarter, driven by strategic investments in tower activity and fiber expansion amidst the 5G rollout, positions the company favorably for sustained growth. The financial robustness, strategic foresight in infrastructure development, and commitment to maintaining high returns on invested capital present a compelling case for an overweight stance.
