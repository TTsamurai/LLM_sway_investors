Based on the recent earnings call, it is clear that Synchrony Financial has faced challenges due to the global pandemic, economic disruption, and unrest due to racial injustice. However, the company has demonstrated resilience, agility, and strength as a business.

Additionally, Synchrony Financial's success has been driven by its commitment to data-driven innovation, a deep understanding of its partners' objectives and customer needs, and its ability to adapt to the competitive landscape and market conditions.

While the current environment presents periods of uncertainty and volatility due to the pandemic, Synchrony Financial has provided a framework for 2021, which includes expectations for loan receivable growth, net interest margin improvement, credit trends, and expense reductions.
