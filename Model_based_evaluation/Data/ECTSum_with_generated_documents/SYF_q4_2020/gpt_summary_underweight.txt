Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, there are several key financial metrics to consider when adopting an 'underweight' investment stance on Synchrony Financial. The company reported several important financial metrics, including earnings, loan receivables, average active accounts, net interest margin, net charge-offs, deposits, expenses, liquidity, capital position, and future expectations for 2021.

Earnings: Synchrony Financial reported earnings of $738 million or $1.24 per diluted share, an increase of $0.09 over last year. 

Loan Receivables: Loan receivables were down 6% to $81.9 billion, and average active accounts decreased 10% from last year.

Net Interest Margin: Net interest margin was down 37 basis points to 14.64%.

Net Charge-Offs: Net charge-offs hit a new low at 3.16%.

Deposits: Deposits were down $2.3 billion or 4% versus last year, with total deposits comprising 80% of the company's funding.

Expenses: Overall expenses were $1 billion for the quarter, down $79 million or 7% from last year. 

Liquidity: Synchrony Financial continues to carry a higher level of liquidity, with total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, at $23.7 billion, which equated to 24.7% of total assets.

Capital Position: The company's CET1 ratio under CECL transition rules was 15.9%, the Tier one capital ratio was 16.8%, and the total capital ratio was 18.1%.

Future Expectations for 2021: The company provided a framework for key drivers in 2021, anticipating continuing pressure from the pandemic and a slow economic recovery in the first half, with improving growth trends expected in the second half as the pandemic impact moderates and macroeconomic growth accelerates.

Based on these key financial metrics and future expectations, an 'underweight' investment stance on Synchrony Financial may be warranted, as the company has experienced declines in loan receivables, net interest margin, and deposits, as well as anticipates increased delinquencies and expenses in 2021. Furthermore, the continued pressure caused by the pandemic on the company's average active accounts and purchase volume may further justify an 'underweight' investment stance.
