Based on the information presented in the recent earnings call, there are several key points that indicate a cautious or skeptical perspective on Synchrony Financial as a potential investment. 

First, there was a decrease in loan receivables by 6% to $81.9 billion, and average active accounts decreased by 10% from last year, with new accounts down 19%. This suggests a decrease in the company's core business metrics, which may indicate a weakening of their market position.

Additionally, purchase volume per account increased by 10% but net interest margin decreased by 37 basis points to 14.64%. This shows a potential decrease in the company's profitability.

Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the company's results, with deposit funding down 4% versus last year. While the company has a liquidity and funding strategy in place, the overall decrease in deposits may be a cause for concern.

The company also noted that their retail landscape is shifting and that they are being very disciplined around risk and returns given the uncertainty in the current environment. This cautious approach to risk management indicates a potential lack of confidence in the company's ability to navigate the current economic climate.

Moreover, the company's CEO is transitioning to a new role, which could introduce uncertainty and potential changes in leadership that may impact the company's future direction.

In conclusion, based on the information from the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on Synchrony Financial due to the various factors that may indicate potential challenges and uncertainties for the company in the near future.
