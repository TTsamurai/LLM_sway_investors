**Executive Summary:**
DXC Technology has displayed robust performance in fiscal year 2021, affirming an 'overweight' investment recommendation. The company's promising trajectory is underscored by its earnings beat, margin expansions, strong book-to-bill ratio, and strategic transformations positioning it for sustained growth.

**Strong Financial Performance:**
DXC Technology concluded fiscal year 2021 on a high note, surpassing revenue and EBIT margin forecasts in Q4. The company reported revenues of $4.39 billion, outshining guidance by $85 million, and an adjusted EBIT margin of 7.5%, topping expectations. This trend marks the third consecutive quarter of revenue stabilization and margin expansion, laying a solid groundwork for continued improvement in FY22.

**Strategic Initiatives and Operational Excellence:**
Under the helm of Mike Salvino, President and CEO, DXC has embarked on a transformative journey sharpening focus on customer engagement, cost optimization, and market expansion.
1. **Customer Intimacy:** The company has reinforced partnerships and expanded its footprint with key clients, such as the five-year contract with Zurich Insurance for IT and security services and a significant deal with Ahold Delhaize. These contracts not only generate stable revenue streams but also strengthen client trust and potential for future projects.
2. **Cost Optimization Program:** DXC has successfully achieved its objective of $550 million in cost savings in FY21, directly contributing to improved profitability and operational efficiency.
3. **Market Presence:** The consistent book-to-bill ratio above 1.0 exemplifies DXC's effectiveness in acquiring new deals and heightening its presence in the IT services market, promising a sustainable growth outlook.

**Debt Management and Financial Strategy:**
The company has remarkably reduced its debt burden, paying down $6.5 billion over nine months, reflecting disciplined financial management and a commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet. This strategic financial handling not only enhances corporate governance but also supports a healthy cash flow trajectory, pivotal for future investments and shareholder returns.

**Guidance and Future Outlook:**
Looking ahead, DXC Technology provides an optimistic view for FY22, expecting revenue stabilization and margin expansion to persist. The company forecasts organic revenue growth of -1% to -2%, reflecting a slowdown in declines, and an EBIT margin between 8.2% to 8.7%. The projected increase in non-GAAP EPS by 42% to 50% year-over-year and a free cash flow of $500 million illustrate a promising growth narrative.

**Recommendation:**
Based on DXC Technology's solid FY21 performance, strategically aligned operational enhancements, and forward-looking guidance, we recommend an 'overweight' stance for investors. The company's resilient business model, coupled with aggressive debt reduction and adaptive strategies amid evolving market dynamics, renders DXC a compelling investment avenue with promising returns. This investment stance is buoyed by not only short-term resiliency but also long-term growth potential as reflected in the companyâ€™s robust strategic foundations and operational executions.
