. Thank you for providing the transcripts. Based on the information provided, I would recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company at this time. The company's revenue growth has slowed, and while there is a focus on cost reduction and returning capital to shareholders, there are concerns about the impact on net income and EPS. Additionally, the competitive environment, especially in the U.S. consumer segment, remains intense. The company is focused on driving more volume onto its network from a wide range of growth opportunities, but there is the need for more time to see if these initiatives will drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth. Overall, the cautious or skeptical perspective on the company suggests that an 'underweight' investment stance would be prudent.
