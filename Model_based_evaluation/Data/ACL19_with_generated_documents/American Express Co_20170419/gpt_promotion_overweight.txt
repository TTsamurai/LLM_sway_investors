 far. Thank you for joining today's earnings call. Based on the information discussed in the transcript, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company's Q1 earnings per share was $1.34, reflecting steady progress and positive momentum in revenue performance. The company has also shown strong billings growth across different segments, highlighting the success of their growth initiatives. Additionally, the company has returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders and is on track to reduce costs by $1 billion by the end of 2017. Their strong capital position and ability to generate sustainable revenue and earnings growth make them a compelling investment opportunity. With a focus on long-term customer relationships and a solid track record of attracting millennials, the company is well-positioned for success. Overall, the company's performance in Q1 and their strategic initiatives make them an attractive investment option.
