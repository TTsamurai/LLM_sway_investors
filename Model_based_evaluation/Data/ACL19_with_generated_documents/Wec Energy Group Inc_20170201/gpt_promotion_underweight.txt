In the report, you might want to consider including the following points:

- The company's projected earnings per share for 2017 are expected to be in the range of $3.06 to $3.12 per share, in line with previously disclosed earnings per share growth expectations.
- The company's plan to acquire Bluewater Gas Holding may involve significant investments in natural gas storage and generation solutions in Michigan, potentially leading to increased debt levels and additional financial risks.
- Regulatory changes, including potential tax reform, may negatively impact both customers and shareholders, with proposed changes including reducing the corporate tax rate, 100% expensing of capital for tax purposes, and eliminating interest expense deduction.

Based on the uncertainties surrounding the company's recent acquisitions and potential regulatory changes, an 'underweight' investment stance might be advisable until more clarity is gained on the impact of these developments.
