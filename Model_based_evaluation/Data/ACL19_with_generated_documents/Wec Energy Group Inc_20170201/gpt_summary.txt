7. Dividend: The company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, representing a compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 fourth quarter level, and targeting a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings.

8. Five-Year Capital Forecast: The company's five-year plan reflects $9.7 billion in capital investments, including natural gas storage and the UP generation investment.

9.

This information can be used to assess the company's financial health, growth prospects, and strategic direction. Additionally, it allows for further analysis and comparison with industry benchmarks and competitors.
