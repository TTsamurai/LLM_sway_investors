**Summary Report of Earnings Conference Call for WEC Energy Group**

**1. Financial Performance Overview (2016):**

- **Adjusted Earnings per Share (EPS):** Reported at $2.97 for 2016, surpassing the guided range of $2.88 to $2.94. This was exclusive of merger-related costs ($0.01 per share).
- **Revenue Increase:** Natural gas Local Distribution Company (LDC) authorized by the Minnesota Commission resulted in an approximately 3% revenue increase ($6.8 million).

**2. Strategic Investments and Operational Developments:**

- **Acquisition of Bluewater Gas Holding:** Purchased for $230 million, adding significant natural gas storage capabilities which can cover approximately one-third of the storage needs for Wisconsin natural gas distribution companies.
- **Upper Peninsula Generation Solution:** Investment in natural gas-fired engines expected to cost $275 million, targeted for completion by 2019, aimed at replacing the coal-fired Presque Isle Power Plant which would reduce operation costs and carbon emissions.

**3. Regulatory and Financial Guidance:**

- **Dividend Increase:** Quarterly cash dividend rose by $0.025 to $0.52 per share, reflecting a 6.6% compound annual growth from the fourth quarter of 2015, with a target payout ratio of 65-70% of earnings.
- **Long-Term Earnings Growth:** Projected to range between 5% to 7% based off the 2015 standalone Wisconsin Energy base.
- **Future Projections:** Capital investment for the upcoming five years has increased to $9.7 billion (from $9.2 billion), including natural gas storage and Upper Peninsula generation investment ($1.4 billion for ATC investments within footprint and $300 million outside).

**4. Tax Reform Implications:**

- **Corporate Tax Rate:** Reduction would benefit customers directly by lowering tax provisions and would be neutral to slightly positive for shareholders.
- **Capital Expensing and Interest Deductibility:** Proposed 100% expensing would impact the rate base negatively in the short term but could be offset partially by lower tax rates. Elimination of interest expense deduction could increase costs for customers but remain neutral for shareholders.

**5. Regulatory Developments:**

- **Rate Case Decisions:** Following one rate case in 2016, there are no immediate plans for new rate case filings in Illinois and decisions in Wisconsin are pending. Earnings sharing mechanisms have already delivered $24 million in benefits to customers.
- **FERC and MISO Decisions:** FERC confirmed a 10.32% base return on equity for ATC; however, future adjustments are anticipated based on ongoing complaints, potentially reducing to 10.2%.

**6. Future Operational Strategies:**

- **O&M Reductions:** Planning a 3% reduction from 2016 levels, with further reductions potentially coming from restructuring the generation portfolio, particularly after new generation assets become operational in 2019.
- **Capital Deployment:** Significant capital allocation towards natural gas distribution, anticipating higher percentage growth in earnings from this segment compared to electric.

**Conclusion:**
WEC Energy Group's strategic initiatives and financial maneuvers in 2016 have poised the company for stable growth and operational efficiency improvements. Despite potential regulatory and tax changes, the company remains focused on maintaining robust financial health and delivering shareholder value. Future activities will closely monitor the impacts of tax reforms and continue operational optimizations to align with long-term financial and operational objectives.
