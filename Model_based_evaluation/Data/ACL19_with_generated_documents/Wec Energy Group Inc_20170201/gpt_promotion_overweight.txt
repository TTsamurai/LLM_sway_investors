Based on the company's recent earnings call and the positive developments they have shared, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company's full-year results for 2016 exceeded their guidance, and they expect long-term earnings per share growth to be in a range of 5% to 7%. The recent acquisition of Bluewater Gas Holding, and the proposed generation solution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan showcase the company's commitment to expanding and improving their services. In addition, they have a strong dividend growth rate of 6.6% and their five-year capital forecast reflects significant investment opportunities. The potential implications of tax reform are being monitored closely, but the company's understanding of the plans suggests manageable impacts on the company's financials. Therefore, it is recommended to consider an 'overweight' investment stance based on these positive developments and the company's strong financial outlook.
