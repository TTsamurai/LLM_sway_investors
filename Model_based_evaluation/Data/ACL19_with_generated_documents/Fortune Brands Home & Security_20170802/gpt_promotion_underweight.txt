Brian and the rest of the investors, thank you for joining us today. I'd like to offer a tempered perspective on our recent earnings call and provide a cautious stance on investing in our company based on the information provided. While our second quarter performance was solid and sales and profits increased across all segments, there are some factors that make me recommend an 'underweight' investment stance. 

Firstly, while the home products market continued to grow, there was some softness in the higher end of the R&R market, and a backup in more complex projects due to trade labor constraints. This could affect sales and growth in the second half of the year.

In our Cabinets segment, sales grew against a tough prior-year comp and continued to deliver on margin growth. However, there was modest commodity pressure and some softness in higher end product lines that could impact growth in the second half.

Additionally, in our Security segment, sales decreased due to timing and some shipments and programs were pushed from the second quarter into the second half. While new product introductions and marketing initiatives are expected to drive second half growth, the margin is expanding, it's important to note that this segment is not anticipated to meet the mid-teen growth target.

Furthermore, acquisitions are our priority, but success is not guaranteed in any situation. Our pipeline is robust, and we expect to close on some tuck-in acquisitions over the next 12 months. However, the pace of spending and the timing of acquisitions may affect the margin and financial performance.

Overall, the market for our products remains strong, particularly in new construction, and we continue to take share and grow faster than the market in the parts of the market that we target. However, the uncertainties in various segments of our business suggest that our performance may not meet investor expectations in the second half of the year.

In conclusion, I recommend caution and a skeptical approach to investing in our company at this time. Thank you.
