Thank you for sharing the transcripts. Based on the information provided, it is clear that the company has performed well in the second quarter across all segments. Sales increased across the company and profit performance was exceptional. The home products market, which impacts over 70% of the company's sales, grew at the expected pace in the second quarter. New construction and R&R demand both showed strong growth, which is expected to continue in the second half of the year. 

Financial metrics such as total company operating margin increased to 15.8% and is tracking to reach the targeted 21% for the year. Plumbing segment sales were up 15% and the North American Plumbing business saw strong momentum in the second quarter. China sales also increased double-digits, driven by share gains and strong demand in direct-to-builder business.

The Cabinets segment showed growth of 1% over the prior year, with operating margin expanding by 70 basis points to 13.6%. Dealer sales were flat but strong demand for new construction in core semi-custom product lines offset some softness at higher end product lines. The company expects mid-single digit growth for the second half of 2017 in this segment.

Doors reported sales growth with gains in wholesale and at retail, and strong operating margin improvement. The Security segment saw a decrease in sales from the prior-year quarter due to timing, but margin continues to expand in this business, with a target of 15% or better for the year.

The company is focused on driving long-term growth through strategic acquisitions, share repurchase, and increasing dividends. There is a robust pipeline for potential acquisitions across all segments of the business, with a potential deployment of over $2 billion over the next three years to drive incremental growth in shareholder value.

Based on the financial metrics and the company's outlook, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance. This is due to potential challenges in the market, potential softness in certain segments, and the need for sustained focus on profitable growth to drive shareholder value. It is important to monitor the company's execution of their growth strategies and acquisitions, as well as the impact of any potential macroeconomic factors on the market.
