Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, the company has shown strong growth in its Government Business, with an increase in enrollment and operating revenue. However, operating margins for the Government Business declined due to lower gross margins in the Medicaid business. The company's Medicaid asset and geographic footprint is well-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities over the next five years. In the Medicare business, the company has made significant progress and expects to grow Medicare Advantage in 2017. 

In the Commercial business, the company experienced better-than-expected enrollment and operating revenue growth, with improved operating margins. However, the ACA-compliant business has seen operating margin losses due to higher-than-expected medical costs. The company's reserves for adverse deviation remain strong, and the debt to cap ratio has improved.

The company reported strong operating cash flow for 2016, which reflects the quality of its earnings. The company's investment portfolio is in a strong position with an unrealized gain. Additionally, the company has been conservative in recording a 100% valuation allowance against any unpaid receivables for risk corridors for the past three benefit years.

Looking ahead, the company expects to face headwinds in the ACA exchanges and is cautious about the potential impact of the upcoming RFP. However, the company is working hard to overcome these challenges and is optimistic about the growth potential for its Medicare and Medicaid businesses.

Overall, the company's financial performance and outlook are favorable, and it is well-positioned for future growth opportunities. As a financial analyst, based on the insights and financial metrics provided in the conference call transcript, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance for the company, considering its strong growth prospects and solid financial position.
