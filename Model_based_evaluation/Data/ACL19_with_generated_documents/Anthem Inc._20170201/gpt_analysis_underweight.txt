Based on the information from the transcript, it is prudent to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. Here are the key insights and financial metrics:
- The Government Business experienced an increase in enrollment and operating revenue, but the operating margins declined due to lower gross margins in the Medicaid business.
- Medicaid margins are expected to compress due to rate actions and higher-than-expected claims, impacting the operating margins.
- The pipeline of opportunity for the Medicaid business remains substantial, but there are risks associated with the Medicaid expansion book of business.
- The Commercial business showed enrollment growth and an increase in operating revenue and operating margins. However, the individual ACA-compliant business experienced operating margin losses due to higher-than-expected medical cost experience.
- The balance sheet showed favorable prior-year reserve development and a decrease in debt to cap ratio.
- The operating cash flow for fiscal year 2016 was stronger than expected.
- The company's effective tax rate is subject to variation based on different factors such as geographic distribution of earnings, investment portfolio composition, and tax planning strategies.

Considering these insights, an 'underweight' investment stance is appropriate due to the margin compression in the Medicaid business, higher-than-expected claims in the individual ACA-compliant business, and the potential tax rate variability affecting the company's earnings. It is advisable to closely monitor the company's performance in the coming quarters and evaluate the impact of the Medicaid expansion, operating margins, and tax planning strategies on its financial position.
