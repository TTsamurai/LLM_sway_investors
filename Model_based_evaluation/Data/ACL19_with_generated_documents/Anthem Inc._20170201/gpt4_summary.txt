The company has demonstrated significant growth in its Government, Medicare, and Commercial business segments, marked by increased enrollments and operational efficiencies. However, there were challenges faced, particularly in the Medicaid and ACA-compliant sectors due to higher-than-expected medical costs and regulatory changes.

2. **Operating Margins:**
