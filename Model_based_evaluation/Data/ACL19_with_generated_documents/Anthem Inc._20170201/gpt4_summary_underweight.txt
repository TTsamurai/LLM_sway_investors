**Investment Stance: Underweight**

**Government Business Performance:**
- Added 109,000 members in the quarter, total 2016 enrollment increased by 614,000.
- 2016 Operating Revenue: $45.5 billion, up 11.4% from 2015.
- Operating Margin: 3.9% in 2016, a decline of 90 basis points from 2015 due to lower Medicaid margins and higher-than-expected claims, particularly in the Iowa contract.

**Medicare and Medicaid Outlook:**
- Improvement in Medicare margins attributed to strategic investments over the past three years.
- Notable challenges in Medicaid due to compression of margins; extensive opportunities in Medicaid expansion despite the anticipated need for pricing adjustments.

**Commercial Business Performance:**
- Enrollment increased by over 700,000 in 2016, totaling 30.4 million (growth of 2.4%).
- 2016 Operating revenue: $38.7 billion, a 3% increase from 2015.
- Operating Margin: Improved by 70 basis points to 8.3%, aided by lower SG&A ratios and strong performance in self-funded product offerings.
- Challenges remain in the ACA-compliant segment with high medical costs, especially from chronic condition treatments.

**Balance Sheet and Cash Flow:**
- Favorable prior-year reserve development of $850 million.
- Stable Days in Claims Payable (41.3 days at year-end).
- Strong operating cash flow of $3.2 billion (1.3 times net income).

**Investment Portfolio and Risks:**
- Cash and investments: $1.4 billion (approx. $3.3 billion accounting for timing impacts).
- Unrealized gain position in the investment portfolio was around $568 million.
- Continued conservative recording of 100% valuation allowance against unpaid receivables for risk corridors.

**Risks & Challenges:**
- Higher medical costs in Medicaid and the individual ACA-compliant segment.
- Margin pressure expected to continue, particularly in Medicaid from required pricing adjustments.
- ACA exchanges not reaching enrollment expectations affecting commercial insured mix and providing significant headwinds as previously warned.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the detailed financial metrics and outlook provided during the call, the recommendation on investment stance remains 'Underweight.' The concerns over margin pressures, particularly in Medicaid, and ongoing higher medical costs in ACA-compliant plans underscore the persistent challenges the company faces. Despite robust growth in membership and some segments showing improvement, these risks suggest potential headwinds in achieving sustained profitability improvements. Future strategies, including handling of the pending PBM RFP and operational efficiencies, will be critical to monitor closely.
