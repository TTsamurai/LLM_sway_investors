Based on the company's recent earnings call, there are several aspects that warrant a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company. 

Firstly, the global revenues for the first quarter saw only a modest increase of 2.1% from the previous year. Internal growth rates were also impacted by the exiting of certain patient transportation contracts and manufacturing and industrial services, leading to a reduced internal growth rate.

Furthermore, the company's gross profit was reduced by approximately 40 basis points in the quarter due to a reclassification of certain expenses, impacting historic and future reporting. 

Although the company reported net income of $53.4 million, it's important to note that this figure was adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments. 

Additionally, the company's international business experienced price pressure and had to exit contracts due to margin issues in Latin America. There was also a reduction in revenues due to the exiting of certain contracts, particularly in the international market.

While the company has been able to generate significant cash and has managed to pay down debt, there are cautionary notes about potential tax payments in the upcoming quarter. 

Overall, based on the information provided in the earnings call, it would be prudent to recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. The modest revenue growth, margin issues in certain international markets, and potential tax payments in the near future all indicate a need for caution when considering an investment in this company.
