Based on the company's recent earnings call, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Stericycle Inc. The first quarter results indicate global revenues of $892.4 million, with a 2.1% increase from the previous year. The company also experienced internal growth rates of 3.6%, excluding certain impacts. Domestic and Canada revenues were $710.8 million, with internal growth of 2.2%. International revenues were $181.6 million, with internal growth of 1.8%. Despite the impact of certain contracts and services, the company's gross profit was $368.7 million, or 41.3% of revenues. Adjusted income from operations was $170.4 million, or 19.1% of revenues. Net income, attributable to Stericycle, was $53.4 million, or $1.09 per share when adjusted for certain expenses. The company's balance sheet shows a strong position, with a covenant debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.38, an unused revolver portion of approximately $715 million, and authorization to purchase 2.9 million shares.

Additionally, the company has continued to focus on integration, route density, and adding additional services to drive growth and profit in the international business. Acquisitions and foreign exchange have also contributed to revenue growth. Stericycle has shown a strong ability to generate cash and has used it to pay down debt. The company's guidance for interest expense is in the range of $100 million to $104 million, including expectations for rate hikes.

Overall, Stericycle Inc. has demonstrated resilience in the face of challenges and continues to show potential for growth and profitability. Considering these factors, an overweight investment stance is recommended for potential investors in Stericycle Inc.
