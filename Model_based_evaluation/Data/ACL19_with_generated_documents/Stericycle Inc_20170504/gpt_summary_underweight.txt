Based on the earnings call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the following reasons:

1. Global revenues increased by 2.1% from the first quarter of 2016, but internal growth rates were impacted by the exiting of certain patient transportation contracts and manufacturing and industrial services.

2. Gross profit was reduced by approximately 40 basis points due to a reclassification of certain expenses from SG&A to cost of revenues, impacting historic and future reporting.

3. Net income, when adjusted for acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments, was only $0.62 per share on an as-reported basis and $1.09 per share.

4. The covenant debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.38 at the end of the quarter, indicating a high level of debt and a potential risk for the company.

5. The company's guidance for interest expense includes expectations for a couple of rate hikes within the year, which may impact profitability.

6. International revenues were impacted by price pressure and the exit of unprofitable contracts in Latin America, leading to a slight reduction in revenue.

Based on these key financial metrics, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance due to the company's challenges with internal growth, gross profit reduction, high debt levels, and potential impacts from interest rate hikes. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding international revenues and the resulting impact on profitability warrant a cautious approach to investment in the company.
