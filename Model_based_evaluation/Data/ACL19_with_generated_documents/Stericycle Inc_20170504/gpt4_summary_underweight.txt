   - **International Revenues**: Reported as $181.6 million with a low internal growth rate of 1.8%, influenced by strategic exits from underperforming contracts.

2. **Profitability Metrics**:

   - **SG&A Expenses**: Excluding amortization, these were $198.3 million, or 22.2% of revenues, indicating significant administrative spending.
   - **Debt to EBITDA Ratio**: Reported at 3.38, demonstrating substantial leverage which could constrain financial flexibility.

5. **Tax and Interest Expenses**:
   - **Net Interest Expense**: Totaled $23.3 million, linked to the high leverage.
   - **Tax Rate**: The reported tax rate was 34.7%.

**II. International Market and Specific Concerns**
1. **International Growth Challenges**: Notably, the company experienced pricing pressures in Latin America and had to exit contracts that did not meet profitability levels. This maneuver likely affects future revenue projections negatively.
   
2. **Strategic Exits**: The exits included patient transportation contracts and certain manufacturing and industrial service contracts, reflecting strategic shifts but also indicating potential issues in operational execution or market assessment.

**III. Acquisition Impact and Future Guidance Adjustments**
1. **Contribution from Acquisitions**: Although acquisitions added $10 million to growth, their impact needs continuous assessment given the overall revenue growth rate and the ongoing integration costs.
   
2. **Adjustments in Financial Guidance**: The forward outlook includes considerations for foreign exchange impacts and the termination of underperforming contracts, which may affect future profitability and operational efficiency.

**IV. Conclusion & Investment Stance**
- **Underweight Stance Justification**: The combination of modest revenue growth, significant leverage, high operational costs (particularly SG&A), and strategic uncertainties in international markets justifies an underweight stance. While there are positive elements such as slight EBITDA margin improvement and manageable cash flows, the broader financial health appears constrained, advising caution for potential investors. Concerns over sustainability of international operations and integration of acquisitions further validate caution. Continued vigilance on debt levels and operational efficiency improvements will be crucial moving forward. 

**Recommendation**: Investors should maintain a cautious approach with a focus on quarterly performance trends, debt management, and execution of strategic initiatives aimed at improving profitability and reducing operational risks, particularly in international markets.
