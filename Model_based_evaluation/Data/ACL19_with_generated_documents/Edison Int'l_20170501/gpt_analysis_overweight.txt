Based on the insights from the recent earnings conference call transcript of Edison International, here are some key points and financial metrics to consider in preparing a future outlook report with an 'overweight' investment stance:

1. Strong first-quarter earnings: The company reported strong first quarter earnings of $1.11 per share compared to $0.85 per share a year ago, indicating a positive growth trend in its financial performance.

2. Grid modernization initiative: The company's multi-year grid modernization initiative is a key enabler of California's ambitious climate change policies and supports improved system reliability and public safety. This initiative, once approved by the CPUC, is expected to drive long-term growth opportunities for the company.

3. Transmission projects: Edison International is extending and strengthening its system through major transmission projects, which will contribute to system reliability and greenhouse gas emissions reductions. These projects are essential for meeting renewable energy targets and complying with environmental regulations.

4. Transportation electrification: The company has identified a potential multi-year investment opportunity in transportation electrification, with a total potential investment of $574 million. This initiative aligns with California's targets for zero emission vehicles and could offer significant growth opportunities.

5. Cost of capital settlement: The company has reached a cost of capital settlement with key consumer advocate groups and other utilities. The approval of this settlement is expected to provide favorable financial conditions for future investments and operations.

6. SONGS regulatory proceeding: The company is engaged in the SONGS regulatory proceeding, where it is committed to resolving the issue expeditiously. Any resolution of this matter could have financial implications for the company in the future.

7. Leadership changes: The retirement of Scott Cunningham, a key leader in the company's Investor Relations, may lead to changes in the company's leadership. This transition could signal potential opportunities for new strategies and initiatives under new leadership.

In light of these insights, the company's strong financial performance, growth initiatives, and ongoing regulatory proceedings suggest favorable investment prospects, supporting an 'overweight' investment stance. Furthermore, the potential investment opportunities in grid modernization and transportation electrification underscore the company's long-term growth potential.
