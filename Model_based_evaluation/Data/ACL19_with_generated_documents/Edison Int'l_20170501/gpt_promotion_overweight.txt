Given the positive outlook for Edison International based on the recent earnings call, the company's strong first quarter earnings of $1.11 per share compared to $0.85 per share a year ago, and the ongoing focus on infrastructure reliability investment and grid modernization initiatives, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company's long-term growth opportunities in areas such as transmission, transportation electrification, and distribution system outlook present a compelling case for investment. Additionally, the potential commercial charging infrastructure investment and policy support for infrastructure investments further strengthen the case for an 'overweight' stance on the company. With the company's fair cost of capital settlement and ongoing commitment to resolving regulatory proceedings, Edison International presents an attractive opportunity for investors. Overall, the company's strong financial performance and ambitious growth initiatives position it as a favorable investment option.
