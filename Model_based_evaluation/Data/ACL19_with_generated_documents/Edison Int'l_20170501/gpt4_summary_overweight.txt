This report will delve into the critical financial metrics and strategic initiatives discussed during the recent earnings conference call, validating an 'overweight' investment stance.

#### Key Financial Highlights
- **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: Q1 2017 exhibits a substantial increase in EPS to $1.11 from $0.85 in the previous year, suggesting improved profitability.
- **Guidance**: Full-year guidance is maintained, with anticipation leaning towards the upper half of the forecast range, reflecting operational confidence.
- **Rate Base Growth**: Despite conservative capital spending recommendations from ORA, Edison projects an 8.6% average annual growth in rate base through 2020, well above the industry norm, signalling strong foundational growth.

#### Strategic Initiatives and Growth Prospects
- **Grid Modernization and Infrastructure Reliability**: In alignment with California's climate change policies, SCE is focused on a multi-year grid modernization initiative crucial for supporting system reliability and public safety. This initiative positions Edison at the forefront of meeting state-mandated GHG reductions and presents an extended growth runway.

- **Electric Vehicle (EV) Infrastructure**: With the CPUC targeting decisions on pilot projects for medium and heavy-duty vehicle charging infrastructure, an investment of $574 million is proposed. This strategic move towards transportation electrification underscores the potential for significant capital expenditure focusing on a future-proof utility framework.

#### Regulatory and Legal Background
- **Cost of Capital Proceedings**: The ongoing proceedings on the cost of capital settlement among major utilities suggest possible favorable outcomes, enhancing financial stability and predictability.
