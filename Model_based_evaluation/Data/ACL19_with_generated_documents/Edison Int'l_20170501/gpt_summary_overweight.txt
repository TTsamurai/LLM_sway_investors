As the financial analyst preparing the summary report, I would focus on the strong first quarter earnings of $1.11 per share compared to $0.85 per share a year ago. This represents a positive growth in earnings. Additionally, I would highlight the aspects of Southern California Edison's long-term growth opportunities, specifically the 2018 General Rate Case and the proposed grid modernization initiative, which align with California's climate change policies and aim to improve system reliability and public safety. In terms of rate base, the annual growth is forecasted to be 6.6% to 2020, which is above the industry average, indicating a strong financial performance and outlook. The company is also extending and strengthening its transmission system, a key aspect of their growth opportunities. 

Furthermore, the potential investment opportunity in transportation electrification, particularly the $574 million proposal for medium and heavy-duty vehicle charging, presents a significant capital spending and rate base opportunity for the company. In addition, the potential need for significantly more commercial charging infrastructure in the future aligns with the California Air Resources Board's recommendation, indicating a potential for further investment in charging infrastructure.

Regarding the cost of capital settlement and the SONGS regulatory proceeding, even though there are ongoing legal and regulatory processes, the company remains confident and focused on its long-term growth opportunities and ensuring a safe and reliable grid.

Overall, highlighting these key financial metrics and growth opportunities supports an 'overweight' investment stance for Edison International, emphasizing the company's strong financial performance and long-term growth potential.
