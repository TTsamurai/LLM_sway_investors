Based on the information from the recent earnings call, there are several reasons to take a cautious stance on investing in Edison International. The company has reported strong first quarter earnings, but has left its full-year guidance unchanged, indicating a hesitancy to formally update their projections. In addition, there is uncertainty surrounding the CPUC's decision on grid modernization, with conflicting recommendations from the Office of Ratepayer Advocates (ORA). The company also faces challenges related to transmission projects and the retirement of gas-fired power plants, which could impact their ability to meet renewable energy targets.

Furthermore, there are ongoing legal proceedings related to the SONGS (San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station) regulatory proceeding, which could introduce additional financial liabilities for the company. The potential resolution of these proceedings remains uncertain. Additionally, the retirement of a long-standing leader in the company's investor relations team may introduce some level of transition risk.

Overall, the various uncertainties and challenges facing Edison International's long-term growth opportunities warrant a cautious or skeptical investment stance. Therefore, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' position in the company until there is more clarity on these key issues.
