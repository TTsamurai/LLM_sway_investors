Summary Report on Recent Earnings Conference Call Transcript

Edison International reported strong first quarter earnings, with a EPS of $1.11 compared to $0.85 a year ago. The company has left its full-year guidance unchanged for now, but has bias towards the upper range. However, key financial metrics indicate a potential 'underweight' investment stance.

The General Rate Case (GRC) filing outlines the continued focus on infrastructure reliability investment and proposes the first elements of a multi-year grid modernization initiative. The Office of Ratepayer Advocates (ORA) recommended zero capital spending for grid modernization, contrary to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) stated goal of completing grid modernization by 2025. However, ORA's overall capital spending recommendations would still yield annual rate base growth above the industry average.

Several transmission projects are underway, aimed at strengthening the system and enabling increased access to renewable energy resources. The potential for investment in transportation electrification presents a major opportunity, with potential investments in charging infrastructure over the next decade.

The cost of capital settlement among the three investor-owned utilities and consumer advocate groups is under review, with no opposition to the proposed settlement. The status of the SONGS regulatory proceeding remains uncertain, with no predetermined drop-dead date for resolution.

The company's organic growth opportunities at SCE and potential M&A transactions are being carefully considered, with a focus on the integration aspects and valuation of any potential deals.

Overall, while the company's strong performance and growth opportunities are evident, the uncertainties surrounding the GRC decision, potential grid modernization challenges, and unresolved regulatory proceedings suggest a cautious investment stance. The potential for significant additional investment in charging infrastructure also presents uncertainties and risks. Thus, an 'underweight' investment stance is advisable.
