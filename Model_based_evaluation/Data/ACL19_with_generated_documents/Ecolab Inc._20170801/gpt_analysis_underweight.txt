Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, the financial outlook for Ecolab appears to be positive. The company reported a 5% increase in adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2017, driven by new business gains, pricing, and cost efficiency work. Sales growth was led by North America and Latin America, and the company expects improving volume growth and pricing across all business segments in the second half of the year.

However, it is important to note that the company also mentioned challenging end markets and higher delivered product costs, which could impact future earnings. The company expects delivered product cost headwinds to ease sequentially through the second half, but it is unclear how much of an impact this will have on the overall financial performance.

Given these insights, it may be prudent to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on Ecolab. While the company expects strong adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in 2017, the potential impact of challenging market environments and higher delivered product costs should be taken into consideration. It would be wise to closely monitor the company's performance in the coming quarters before making any significant investment decisions.
