Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on Ecolab. The company saw continued new business gains and pricing which drove acquisition adjusted fixed currency sales growth in multiple segments. Despite the impact of higher delivered product costs and challenging end markets, the company managed to increase its adjusted earnings per share by 5% in the second quarter. Additionally, the company expects improving volume growth and pricing, and anticipates strong adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in 2017. With a projected 8% to 12% increase in earnings per share for the full year and a 6% to 13% increase in the third quarter, Ecolab appears to have a solid growth trajectory. Therefore, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended based on the company's recent performance and outlook.
