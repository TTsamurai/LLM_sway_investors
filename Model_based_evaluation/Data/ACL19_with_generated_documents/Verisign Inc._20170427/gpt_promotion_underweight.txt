Based on the company's recent earnings call, there are several reasons to be cautious or skeptical about investing in this company. The revenue growth is relatively low, at just 2.4% year-over-year and 0.8% sequentially. Additionally, the company has a high level of total liabilities compared to its total assets, with liabilities totaling $3.5 billion and assets totaling $2.3 billion.

The company's non-GAAP operating margin, while increasing slightly, is only expected to be between 64.5% and 65.25% for the full year of 2017, which may indicate a lack of strong profitability. The company also anticipates an increase in marketing spending as a percentage of sales in the subsequent quarters, which could impact profitability.

Furthermore, the company's guidance for the full year 2017 has been adjusted and narrowed, which may suggest uncertainty or volatility in its projections. Additionally, with the lack of disclosure on the sale proceeds from iDefense and limited details on future launches and operations in international markets, there is a lack of transparency and potential risks involved.

Given these factors, it may be advisable to recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on this company at this time. Investors should exercise caution and carefully consider the potential risks and uncertainties before making any significant investments.
