Based on the recent earnings call, it is clear that the company has seen impressive top-line growth, particularly in North America, with positive comparable store sales and overall gross margin expansion. The company reported double digit earnings growth in the quarter, despite a deliberate pullback in the North America wholesale channel and unanticipated currency fluctuations.

The company's international business also showed notable strength, particularly in Europe and mainland China, which represents significant opportunities for their brands. Additionally, the opening of global flagship locations and the strategic partnership with Selena Gomez demonstrate the company's focus on expanding its global presence and brand relevance.

The company's strategic focus on product, stores, and marketing has resulted in positive customer response and brand perception. The continued execution of the Coach brand transformation and the successful implementation of the modern luxury concept in retail locations reaffirm the company's commitment to delivering a unique customer experience and elevating the brand.

Furthermore, the company's international performance, despite challenges in certain markets, has shown positive growth and stronger results in regions such as Greater China and Europe.

Based on the earnings call, it is clear that the company has a strong growth strategy, a focus on brand transformation and expansion, and a commitment to delivering a unique customer experience. Therefore, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company, as it shows potential for continued growth and success in the future.
