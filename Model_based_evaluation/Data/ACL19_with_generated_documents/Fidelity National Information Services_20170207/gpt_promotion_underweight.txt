 based on the companyâ€™s recent earnings call, there are several reasons to be cautious or skeptical of an investment in this company:

1. The revenue growth of 4.8% in the fourth quarter and 4.6% for the full year of 2016, while positive, is not as high as expected by analysts and investors, signaling potential challenges in expanding the company's business.

2. While EBITDA grew to $846 million in the fourth quarter, representing a 15.2% increase compared to the prior year, the adjusted net earnings from continuing operations was $377 million, which is less than half of the EBITDA, indicating potential inefficiencies in the company's operations.

3. The higher margin product sales and cost synergies that drove the margin expansion of the GFS segment are not sustainable and may not be replicable in the future, raising concerns about the company's ability to maintain profitability.

4. The planned divestiture of the public sector and education businesses, while generating net cash proceeds of approximately $500 million, will create a headwind to consolidated organic revenue growth of approximately 1%, which could impact the company's overall financial performance.

5. The expectations for consolidated organic revenue growth of 2% to 3% in 2017, while positive, are relatively conservative and may not meet the long-term organic revenue guidance of 3% to 7% provided by the company, suggesting potential challenges in achieving growth targets.

Based on these factors, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company, as there are potential risks and uncertainties that could impact its future financial performance.
