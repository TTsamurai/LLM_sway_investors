 based on the excess cash generated. Overall, we are confident in our guidance for the year and our ability to continue to drive value to our shareholders through our compelling business model and strong cash flow generation. Our adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $4.15 to $4.30 per share, representing growth of 9% to 13%, or 12% to 16% adjusted for the impact of the PS&E divestiture. This does not include any share buybacks, but we anticipate having the flexibility to do so in late 2017 and into 2018. Overall, we are confident in our guidance for the year and our ability to continue to drive value to our shareholders through our compelling business model and strong cash flow generation. Based on the company's recent earnings call, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. With revenue increasing on an organic basis and EBITDA experiencing significant growth, as well as adjusted net earnings and earnings per share increasing, the company has demonstrated strong financial performance. The completion of the sale of the public sector and education businesses has also provided the company with net cash proceeds, which have been used to pay down debt and reduce interest expense. With projected consolidated organic revenue growth of 2% to 3%, IFS organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%, and GFS organic revenue growth of 4% to 5%, the company is poised for continued success in 2017. Furthermore, the company's ability to generate significant cash flow, reduce debt, and increase dividends demonstrates its commitment to creating value for shareholders. Therefore, we recommend an overweight investment stance on the company based on its strong financial performance and strategic actions.
