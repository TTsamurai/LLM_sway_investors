. This indicates a strong financial performance for the company in 2016, with increases in revenue and EBITDA in all segments. The EBITDA margin expansion across segments and the significant cash flow generation are also positive indicators. The successful completion of the PS&E divestiture is a step towards strategic focus and deleveraging efforts, which will be beneficial for future financial health.

The guidance for 2017 indicates a conservative outlook, with a focus on organic revenue growth and cost synergies. The strategic and scale-driven growth in IFS and GFS segments, as well as the focus on debt reduction and dividend increase, are positive signs for shareholders.

Key financial metrics include the following:
- Revenue increased by 4.8% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter of 2016 and by 4.6% for the full year.
- EBITDA grew to $846 million in the fourth quarter, a 15.2% increase compared to the prior year, and to $2.9 billion for the full year, an 11.1% increase compared to the prior-year period.
- Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations was $377 million in the fourth quarter and adjusted earnings per share increased by 22.6% to $1.14 per share.

Overall, the company's strong performance in 2016, coupled with the strategic focus on core segments and debt reduction, supports an 'overweight' investment stance.
