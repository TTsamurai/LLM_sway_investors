Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations was $377 million for the quarter, and adjusted earnings per share increased 22.6% to $1.14 per share.

Furthermore, the company exceeded its run rate synergy goal of $200 million for 2016 and completed the year with a margin expansion of 220 basis points to 31.2%.

Based on these positive financial outcomes, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for the company. The strong revenue and EBITDA growth, margin expansion, and ability to exceed synergy goals demonstrate the company's robust financial position and potential for further growth. Additionally, the company's free cash flow of $435 million for the quarter and $1.5 billion for the year, along with a 12% increase in quarterly dividend to $0.29 per share, indicate a commitment to creating shareholder value.

The company also provided guidance for 2017, including a consolidated organic revenue growth of 2% to 3%, IFS organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%, and GFS organic revenue growth of 4% to 5%. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be $3.04 billion to $3.12 billion, with adjusted earnings per share of $4.15 to $4.30 per share, representing growth of 9% to 13%. The company also anticipates exiting the year with a cost synergy run rate in excess of $275 million.

Overall, the positive financial performance and outlook for 2017 support an 'overweight' investment stance for the company, based on the potential for continued revenue and earnings growth, as well as the commitment to returning value to shareholders through dividends and potential share buybacks.
