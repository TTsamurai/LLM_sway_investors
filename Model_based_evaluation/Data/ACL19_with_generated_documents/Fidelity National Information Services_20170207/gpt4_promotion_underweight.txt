While the company's financial performance in 2016 shows several positive outcomes, such as increased revenue, EBITDA growth, and substantial free cash flow, several cautions and reservations must be considered before taking an 'overweight' investment stance.

1. **Scepticism Over Future Growth Trajectories:**
   The company's projected growth for 2017 and beyond, particularly the 2% to 3% anticipated organic revenue growth, appears modest. This raises concerns about the company's potential to sustain significant growth, especially considering the aggressive competition faced by the IFS segment. The caution here lies in the rapidly shifting market dynamics and consumer preferences which might affect the company’s core areas negatively.

2. **Continued Dependence on Synergies and Cost-Cutting:**
   Much of the company's margin improvement relies heavily on cost synergies from the SunGard acquisition and other cost management initiatives. Relying excessively on cost reductions to drive profitability can be a precarious strategy in the long term, particularly if the market becomes saturated or competitive forces intensify.

3. **High Debt Levels:**
   Despite efforts in reducing debt — approximately $1 billion cut in 2016 — the remaining $10.5 billion is still considerable. The high leverage might constrict the company's financial flexibility, making it vulnerable to shifts in credit markets or economic downturns.

4. **Divestitures and their Consequences:**
   The sale of the public sector and education businesses might streamline the company’s focus but also results in a loss of revenue streams which contributed $80 million to the EBITDA in 2016. This could limit revenue diversity and potential growth avenues. Additionally, the loss of a key client and declining check volumes in the Corporate and Other segment creates further revenue challenges.

5. **Challenging Macroeconomic Conditions:**
   External factors such as economic conditions, as acknowledged by the company’s dependence on conservative market conditions, could pose significant risks to achieving the growth forecasts. Unforeseen geopolitical events or financial market volatility can have adverse impacts not fully accounted for in the projections.

6. **Market Consolidation and Competitive Pressures:**
   The company has acknowledged the impact of market consolidation on its operations, particularly affecting the IFS segment’s growth. This consolidation could lead to fewer clients and increased pricing pressure, both of which could affect long-term revenue growth.

Investment Recommendation: Underweight
   Given these concerns — particularly the modest growth projections amidst high competition, reliance on divestitures and cost synergies for profit, and substantial ongoing debt — a cautious investment stance is recommended. The risk factors highlighted suggest potential for limited upside and significant downside exposure. Investors should maintain an underweight position until clearer signs of sustainable growth trajectories and successful mitigation of outlined risks emerge.
