 based on the transcript of the recent earnings conference call, it is evident that the company showed strong financial performance in the quarter and for the full year of 2016. Key financial metrics such as revenue, EBITDA, and adjusted net earnings from continuing operations all showed robust growth. The company reported revenue growth of 4.8% in the fourth quarter and 4.6% for the full year on an organic basis. EBITDA grew to $846 million in the fourth quarter, a 15.2% increase compared to the prior year and reached $2.9 billion for the full year, an 11.1% increase.

EBITDA margins also expanded significantly, with a 220 basis point expansion in the fourth quarter to 31.2% and a 380 basis point expansion for the full year to 30.4%. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 22.6% in the fourth quarter to $1.14 per share and 18.6% for the full year to $3.82 per share.

The company also demonstrated strong cash flow generation, with free cash flow of $435 million in the fourth quarter and $1.5 billion for the year, resulting in a 115% conversion to adjusted net earnings. Additionally, the company reduced its debt by approximately $1 billion in 2016 and returned $341 million in dividends while ending the year with $10.5 billion of debt outstanding as of December 31.

However, despite the strong financial performance, I would recommend an 'underweight' investment stance based on several factors. Firstly, the company's guidance for 2017 suggests a lower organic revenue growth rate of 2% to 3%, which is a significant deceleration from the growth rates achieved in 2016. The divestiture of the public sector and education businesses is expected to create headwinds for organic revenue growth in 2017.

Additionally, the company's effective tax rate is expected to decrease from 35% to 32% in 2017, which could be a positive factor for earnings growth. However, the impact of the tax reduction on the bottom line might not be substantial enough to offset the decelerating organic revenue growth.

Furthermore, the company's plan to use excess cash for debt repayments and potential share buybacks might limit opportunities for future capital investment or strategic acquisitions.

In summary, while the company has demonstrated strong financial performance in the past, the outlook for 2017 suggests a deceleration in growth and potential limitations on future investment opportunities. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended.
