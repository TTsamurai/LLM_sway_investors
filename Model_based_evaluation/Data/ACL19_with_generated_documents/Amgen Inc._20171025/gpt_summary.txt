4. XGEVA: XGEVA declined by 2% year-over-year, but the company expects growth in 2018 with the addition of a multiple myeloma indication.

5. Neulasta: Neulasta declined by 6% year-over-year due to a shift in timing of purchases by some larger end customers, as well as a decline in the number of myelosuppressive chemotherapy regimens.

7. Sensipar: Sensipar increased by 10% year-over-year, primarily due to net selling price.

Overall, Amgen is focused on a strong finish to 2017 and preparing for numerous launches in 2018, including Repatha outcomes label, Enbrel AutoTouch device, Aimovig for migraine, Parsabiv, XGEVA multiple myeloma indication, and opportunities from the biosimilar franchise.
