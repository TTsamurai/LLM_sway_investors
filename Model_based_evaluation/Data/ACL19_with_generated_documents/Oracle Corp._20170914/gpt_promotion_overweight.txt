Based on the recent earnings call, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company's Q1 results were strong, with total revenue at the high end of guidance and earnings per share beating guidance by $0.01. Cloud revenue continues to show significant growth, with SaaS revenue up 61% from last year and a goal of achieving 80% gross margins for SaaS as soon as FY 2019. Additionally, the company's non-GAAP operating income was up 10% from last year, marking the first double-digit growth since the Cloud transformation. The company has also repurchased a significant number of shares and paid out dividends, demonstrating commitment to returning value to shareholders. For Q2, the company is expecting continued growth in Cloud revenue, with a range of 39% to 43%, and total revenue growth is expected to range from 2% to 4%. Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be between $0.64 and $0.68, with the USD number in the range between $0.66 and $0.70 at current exchange rates. This strong performance and projected growth indicate a promising outlook for the company, making it an attractive investment opportunity.
