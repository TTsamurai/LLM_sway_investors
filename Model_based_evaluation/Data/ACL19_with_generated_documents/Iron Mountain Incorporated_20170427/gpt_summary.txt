6. Decline in adjusted gross margin of 120 basis points due to Recall's lower margins, offset by other business improvements.
7. SG&A expenses increased by 20.1% from the previous year, but decreased as a percentage of total revenues due to transformation integration benefits and reduction in bad debt expense.
8. Adjusted EBITDA margin in Q1 was 31.2%, 10 basis points lower than a year ago.
