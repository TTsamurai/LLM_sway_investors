Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, the company has reported strong internal storage revenue growth and consistent adjusted EBITDA growth. The integration of Recall and the Transformation Program is on track, with a decline in SG&A as a percentage of total revenue. However, the company's adjusted EBITDA margin has declined due to the mix of Recall's lower margins.

The guidance for 2017 remains unchanged, with expected adjusted EBITDA growth of 17.5% and adjusted EBITDA margins expanding to around 33%. Additionally, the company expects AFFO to grow by 11.5% at the midpoint, supporting a 7% dividend growth in 2018.

Despite the positive outlook, it is important to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for several reasons. Firstly, the company's adjusted EBITDA margin has declined due to the mix of Recall's lower-margin business, which may impact profitability in the future. Additionally, the company's tax rate has increased, negatively impacting adjusted EPS. Furthermore, there may be potential impact on full year adjusted EBITDA expectations due to operating expenditures associated with innovation initiatives.

Overall, while the company has demonstrated strong performance and growth, the potential impact of lower margins and increased expenses on future profitability warrants an 'underweight' investment stance. It is important to closely monitor the company's financial performance and strategic initiatives to make appropriate investment decisions.
