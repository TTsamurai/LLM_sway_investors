 in order to provide a compelling promotion for investing in Iron Mountain, I would highlight the following key points from the recent earnings call:

1. Strong internal storage revenue growth of 3%, excluding acquisitions, demonstrates solid underlying business fundamentals and continued volume growth across all major markets.

2. Consistent adjusted EBITDA growth of over 24% from the acquisition of Recall and underlying margin improvement.

3. Integration of Recall and Transformation Program on track, as evidenced by the 100 basis point decline in SG&A as a percentage of total revenue.

4. First quarter total revenues growth of 25.1% driven by acquisitions and strong internal storage revenue growth.

5. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 31.2% in Q1, expected to expand to around 33% for the full year 2017.

6. Anticipated AFFO growth of 11.5% at the midpoint, supporting expected dividend growth of 7% in 2018.

7. Liquidity of nearly $1 billion at quarter-end and projected CAD to cover anticipated full-year dividend and required maintenance capital expenditures.

8. Expected terming out of borrowings with longer-term debt and attractive rates to remain in targeted capital structure and take advantage of market conditions.

Based on these highlights, I would recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Iron Mountain, as the company has demonstrated steady growth, strong margins, and effective leadership. The integration of acquisitions and transformation efforts are on track, and the company's outlook for 2017 remains unchanged since February, indicating confidence in their business trends and fundamentals. Additionally, the expected expansion of adjusted EBITDA margin and AFFO growth support the potential for strong returns on investment in the coming years.
