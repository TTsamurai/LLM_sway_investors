Subject: Cautionary Analysis and Recommendation for Underweight Investment Stance on Iron Mountain Incorporated

Dear Committee Members,

This analysis serves as a cautionary review of Iron Mountain Incorporated following their recent earnings call. Despite declarations of strong performance and consistent growth, several underlying concerns merit attention that could impact our investment weighting decision.

**Revenue Growth Reliance on Acquisitions**: Iron Mountain’s first quarter revenue growth appears robust at 25.1%. However, it is crucial to highlight that this growth is largely driven by acquisitions, notably the acquisition of Recall. Organic internal storage growth was reported at only 3%, which raises concerns about the company's fundamental growth capabilities without relying on external expansions.

**Integration and Marginal Improvements Risks**: The company’s ongoing integration of Recall and other transformation initiatives are purportedly on track, with operational improvements cited such as a 100 basis point decline in SG&A as a percentage of total revenue. Nonetheless, integrations are inherently risky and may result in unforeseen costs or disruptions. The margin improvements thus far have been modest and may not justify the integration risks.

**Increased SG&A Expenses**: Adjusted for Recall integration costs, SG&A expenses increased significantly by 20.1% year over year. While presented as a decrease in percentage terms relative to revenue, the absolute increase in expenditure is considerable and could impede net profitability if growth falters.

**Taxation and Structural Concerns**: The increase in the effective structural tax rate from 14% to 23.1% due to changes in UK tax legislation introduces additional financial strain and highlights vulnerability to legislative changes in operating regions. This elevated tax rate is noteworthy as it affects net income and ultimately, shareholder returns.

**Foreign Exchange and Debt Levels**: Approximately 70% of adjusted EBITDA is generated in U.S. dollars, which offers some protection against foreign exchange fluctuations. However, 23% of the company’s debt is in non-U.S. currencies, exposing them to currency risks despite efforts at natural hedging. With a lease-adjusted debt ratio reported at 5.8 times, the high leverage could become burdensome especially if EBITDA growth does not materialize as projected.

**Seasonal and Incremental Expenses**: Seasonal variations and unexpected costs, such as the $6 million expense related to innovation investments, have affected margins and could continue to do so. These types of expenses introduce volatility to earnings and need careful monitoring.

**Market Saturation and Innovation Necessity**: The company’s pivot towards innovation and service diversification away from traditional storage indicates a possible saturation in its core market segments. This strategic shift, while potentially beneficial, carries execution risk and uncertain returns on the investments.

**Guidance and Forward Outcomes**: The projected growth in adjusted EBITDA (17.5% at midpoint for FY 2017) and AFFO (11.5% at midpoint) alongside dividends appear optimistic but depend heavily on perfect execution and favorable market conditions.

**Recommendation**:
Based on the aforementioned analysis, I recommend an 'underweight' stance on Iron Mountain Incorporated. The company shows operational sturdiness, but there are significant risks associated with integration, high leverage, dependency on acquisitions for growth, and potential regulatory impacts which could undermine future performance. Close monitoring of management’s execution on strategic initiatives, integration outcomes, and organic growth acceleration is advised to reassess our investment position as needed.
