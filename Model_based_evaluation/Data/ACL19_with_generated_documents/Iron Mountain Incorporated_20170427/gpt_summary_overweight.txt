Thank you for providing the transcript. Based on the information provided, the key financial metrics and highlights for the recent earnings conference call are as follows:

1. Strong internal storage revenue growth of 3%, excluding Recall and other smaller acquisitions.
2. Consistent adjusted EBITDA growth of over 24% from the acquisition of Recall and underlying margin improvement.
3. Integration of Recall and the Transformation Program on track, evidenced by a 100 basis point decline in SG&A as a percentage of total revenue.
4. Quarterly total revenues growth of 25.1%, in line with expectations, driven by acquisitions and strong internal storage revenue growth.
5. Adjusted gross margin declined year-over-year by 120 basis points and sequentially declined by 80 basis points, mainly due to the mix of Recall's lower margins and seasonality of utility costs and compensation expenses.
6. Adjusted EBITDA margin declined by 10 basis points from a year ago, primarily due to Recall's lower-margin business, but would have been 10 basis points higher excluding expenses related to innovation investments.
7. Adjusted EPS growth was negatively impacted by an increase in the structural tax rate from 14% to 23.1% year-over-year.
8. AFFO was in line with expectations and expected to support a 7% dividend growth in 2018.
9. For 2017, the company expects adjusted EBITDA to grow by 17.5%, with margins expanding to around 33%, an increase of about 200 basis points compared to 2016.
10. Projected cash available for distribution and investments (CAD) remains unchanged from the previous earnings call.

Regarding the investment stance, based on the provided financial metrics and outlook for 2017, it appears that the company has demonstrated strong performance and expects further growth in adjusted EBITDA and margins. The integration of Recall and the Transformation Program has shown positive results, driving internal storage revenue growth and improved EBITDA margins. Additionally, the company is maintaining a healthy liquidity position and is well-positioned to deliver on its financial projections for the year.

Considering these factors, it would be reasonable to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance on the company, as it shows signs of continued growth and improved financial performance. However, it is important to monitor the company's ability to execute on its growth projections and manage the impact of changes in tax rates and acquisition expenses, particularly related to innovation initiatives.
