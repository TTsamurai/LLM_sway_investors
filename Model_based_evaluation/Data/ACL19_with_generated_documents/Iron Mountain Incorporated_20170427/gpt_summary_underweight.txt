Based on the provided transcript from the recent earnings conference call, it is clear that the company has demonstrated strong internal storage revenue growth, maintained consistent adjusted EBITDA growth, and achieved improvements in SG&A as a percentage of total revenue. However, there are some key financial metrics that raise concerns and support the 'underweight' investment stance.

Firstly, the decline in adjusted gross margin by 120 basis points from a year ago and 80 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter is a cause for concern. This decline can be attributed to the mix of Recall's lower margins, including higher rent expense, and seasonal utility cost and compensation expense. Additionally, the impact of $6 million of expense related to innovation investments has affected the adjusted EBITDA margin, which was 31.2%, 10 basis points lower than a year ago, and declined 50 basis points sequentially from Q4. Excluding the $6 million expense, the adjusted EBITDA would have been 31.8%, up 10 basis points sequentially from Q4 2016.

Furthermore, the growth of adjusted EPS to $0.24 per diluted share for the quarter was negatively impacted by the year-over-year increase in the structural tax rate, which was 23.1% in the current quarter, compared to 14% a year ago. The anticipated structural tax rate for the full year 2017 is expected to be approximately 20%, which is higher than previous guidance.

In addition, the company's leveraged position with a lease-adjusted debt ratio of 5.8 times at quarter-end, which is in line with expectations, may continue to put pressure on the company's financial stability and ability to take advantage of market conditions. The projected CAD to cover anticipated full-year dividend and required maintenance capital expenditures, with approximately $125 million of capital remaining to support core growth, may require about $200 million of external funding for the remainder.

Based on these financial metrics and the concerns raised, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. Despite the strong internal storage revenue growth and consistent adjusted EBITDA growth, the decline in adjusted gross margin, the impact of innovation investments, and the increase in structural tax rate are factors that indicate caution and warrant a more conservative investment approach.
