Thank you for the detailed information. Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. The company's strong internal storage revenue growth and consistent adjusted EBITDA growth are positive factors. However, there are several potential risks to consider. These include a decline in adjusted gross margins, an increase in adjusted EBITDA expenses due to innovation investments, and a higher structural tax rate impacting adjusted EPS.

Additionally, the company's outlook for 2017, while positive, may be impacted by potential slowdown in year-over-year growth due to tougher comps in the second half of the year. Furthermore, the company's high leverage ratio and the need for external funding for core growth and discretionary investments may pose financial risks.

Overall, while the company has demonstrated steady growth and strong margins, the cautious perspective is warranted given the potential risks and uncertainties highlighted in the recent earnings call.
