Based on the recent earnings call and the information provided in the transcript, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company's adjusted results were in line with expectations, with total company sales up by 2%. The company has taken steps to create value for customers, execute pricing initiatives in the U.S. and improve the economics of the portfolio. The company is restructuring its Canadian business, closing poorly performing assets and aiming to exit 2017 in a break-even run rate. 

The company's online and international businesses have shown strong sales growth and expanded operating margins. The U.S. business has seen significant volume growth and the company expects to gain share profitably through its pricing actions and marketing activities. Additionally, the company is focused on cost takeout and expense management, with a target of taking out $100 million to $125 million of costs by 2019.

The company is reiterating its 2017 adjusted guidance and its long-term operating margin guidance, and is confident in its ability to achieve its 2019 objectives. The company is also focused on improving its competitive position and customer experience, with a strong focus on customer acquisition and retention.

Overall, the company's performance and strategic initiatives indicate a positive future outlook, making it an attractive investment opportunity. Therefore, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended based on the company's recent earnings call.
