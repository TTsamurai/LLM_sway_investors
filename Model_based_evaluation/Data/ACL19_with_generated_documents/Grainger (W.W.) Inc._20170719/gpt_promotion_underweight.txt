Based on the recent earnings call from the company, it is evident that they are undergoing significant restructuring and pricing initiatives to improve their business. However, the impact of these changes on their financials and profitability remains uncertain. The company's performance in Canada and the U.S. has shown some improvement, but their guidance for the future does not seem very optimistic.

The company is also facing challenges with government spending, which has impacted their sales and financials. Additionally, the competitive environment in the industry has put pressure on margins, and the impact of their pricing changes on the competitive landscape is not yet clear.

The company's focus on expense management and cost reductions may help improve their profitability, but the extent of these improvements remains to be seen. Overall, the company's future outlook seems uncertain, and the impact of their restructuring and pricing initiatives on their financials and profitability needs to be closely monitored before considering an investment. Therefore, a cautious or skeptical stance on investing in the company, recommending an 'underweight' investment stance, would be appropriate at this time.
