For the financial analyst tasked with preparing a future outlook report for the company, it is important to note the significant restructuring charges the company faced in the quarter, as well as the impact on the Canadian and U.S. businesses. The company's pricing actions in the U.S. had an effect on volume and gross profit, with volume for the company showing healthy growth. The company also saw nice growth in its online and international businesses and is optimistic about the future profitability of these segments.

Key insights from the earnings conference call transcript show that the company is focused on improving the profitability of its businesses and is taking steps to transform its Canadian business. The company is also confident in its pricing actions and expects continued positive response to these actions in the second half of the year. For the U.S. business, the company anticipates gaining share profitably and expects to continue taking cost out of the business while improving the customer experience. The company is also reiterating its 2017 adjusted guidance issued in April and is confident in its long-term operating margin guidance for 2019.

Based on the financial metrics derived from the transcript, the financial analyst can adopt an 'underweight' investment stance by considering the impact of the restructuring charges, the performance of the U.S. and Canadian businesses, and the potential risks associated with the company's pricing actions. It is important for the analyst to closely monitor future developments and the company's ability to achieve its profitability targets before considering a more positive investment stance.
