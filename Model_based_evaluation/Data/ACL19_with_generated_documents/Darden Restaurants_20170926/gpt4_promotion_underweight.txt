Thank you for joining us today. As we walk through the company's recent performance and look ahead, our perspective on the investment stance towards the company is cautiously conservative. We recommend an 'underweight' position for the following reasons:

1. **Single-Digit Growth in Same Restaurant Sales**: Despite a positive streak in same restaurant sales growth, the figures hover around low single digits (e.g., Olive Garden at 1.9% and Longhorn Steakhouse at 2.6%). These figures, although positive, are modest and suggest a plateauing in traction among the existing customer base.

2. **Cheddarâ€™s Performance Concerns**: Cheddar's experienced a decline in same restaurant sales by 1.4%. This is indicative of challenges in integrating the new acquisition into the broader operational and culture framework of the company. The severity of the integration challenges, compounded by heavy impacts from external events like Hurricane Harvey, raises concerns about the near-term performance stability and potential hidden costs in alignment and standardization processes.

3. **Hurricane Impacts and External Challenges**: The management highlighted the significant impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma. While the response was commendably managed, the recurrent nature of such disruptions can pose ongoing risks to operational stability and financial performance, especially considering the heavy footprint in affected areas.

4. **Pricing Strategy Risks**: The increase in pricing, such as the soup, salad, and breadsticks offering at Olive Garden from $5.99 to $6.99, though profitable, has led to reduced traffic. This price sensitivity indicates a potential vulnerability in customer loyalty and competitive positioning in a sharp retail environment, where value for money remains pivotal.

5. **Operational Integration Complexity**: The integration of Cheddar's, including implementation of new systems and processes, while necessary for long-term gains, is likely to continue imposing short-term operational strains and financial burdens. The scale of these changes may distract from focusing on core competencies and customer experience.

6. **Reliance on Promotions and Non-Guest Facing Improvements**: The considerable emphasis on promotions, like Buy One Take One, and significant investments in back-end operations highlight potential inefficiencies in the core business model that require masking through high promotional activity.

In light of these concerns, we believe that the company's current trajectory, though overall positive in gross figures, presents underlying vulnerabilities that could affect its ability to sustain performance in tougher macroeconomic conditions or increased competitive pressures. It is prudent for investors to maintain a conservative stance until clearer signs of robustness in operational and financial metrics emerge, mitigating the outlined risks.
