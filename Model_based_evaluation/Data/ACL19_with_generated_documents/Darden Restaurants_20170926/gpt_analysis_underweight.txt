 perspective. We have a substantial investment in the business, and we have to look at the long-term sustenance and growth of the business. Yes, when you think about third party, when you think about value, when you think about Olive Garden and its competition in the marketplace, there are a lot of levers to pull, and I talked about Olive Garden’s price point significantly under-inflating our competitors, and you have to be careful with that. In Q4 and in some of the bigger holidays, going into Q1 and Q2, it might be a little lower, so just make sure you’re reflecting all those pricing activities, and just remember, you’re looking at two different models. Currently at Cheddar’s, we’re looking to simplify the menu and standardize it, and some of the activities, such as eliminating certain targeted digital incentives, actually help the bottom line. It’s a give and take between the price points and the value to the customer. Our guidance takes all of these activities and insights into account, and we remain confident in our projections for the upcoming year.
