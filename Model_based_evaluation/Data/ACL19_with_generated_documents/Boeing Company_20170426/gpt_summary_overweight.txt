. Overall, Boeing's first quarter financial results demonstrate strong performance and robust growth opportunities in both the commercial airplane and defense segments. The company generated $2.1 billion of operating cash and repurchased $2.5 billion of Boeing stock, while also increasing their dividend per share by 30% for a total payout of $868 million. Revenue for the quarter was $21 billion and core earnings per share of $2.01 were driven by a strong operating performance and lower than expected tax rate.

In Boeing Commercial Airplanes, 169 new jet liners were delivered and 198 net new orders worth $15 billion were added to the backlog. The business generated solid revenue of $14.3 billion with operating margins of 8.5%. Furthermore, key milestones were achieved, including FAA certification of the 737 MAX 8 and first flight of the 787-10, one month earlier than the development schedule established three years ago. The narrowbody market, in particular, continues to show strong demand, with a backlog of more than 4,500 aircraft and a production skyline oversold through the end of the decade. The widebody market also presents promising long-term demand, with forecasts indicating the need for more than 9,000 widebody aircraft over the next 20 years.

Boeing Defense, Space & Security reported first quarter revenue of $6.5 billion with operating margins of 11.3%. Significant orders were booked, including contracts for AH-64 Apache helicopters, P-8 Poseidon aircraft, and KC-46 Tanker aircraft. International demand for offerings, including rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters, satellites, and services, remains high, with notable foreign military sales agreements in place. The President's FY 2018 defense budget request calls for growth in military spending, further indicating strong potential for the defense business.

Boeing's integrated services business is poised for expansion, with the upcoming launch of Boeing Global Services in the third quarter. This new business will focus on growing the $2.5 trillion services market, leveraging existing parts, modification, and upgrade businesses, as well as expanding into digital aviation services, engineering services, and information-based services. The company sees significant organic growth opportunities in the digital aviation services arena, with a focus on commercial and defense sectors.

Financial guidance for 2017 bounds the range of outcomes from various scenarios, and the company anticipates cash flows to grow annually over the remainder of the decade, driven by higher 737 deliveries and improving 787 profitability. With a balanced approach to investment and growth, Boeing stands positioned for continued leadership in the market, sustained growth, and increasing value for stakeholders.

In conclusion, Boeing's financial performance, alongside growth prospects in both commercial and defense businesses, supports an 'overweight' investment stance. The company's solid operating performance, strong backlog, ongoing market demand, and strategic investments in future capabilities position Boeing as a compelling opportunity for investors.
