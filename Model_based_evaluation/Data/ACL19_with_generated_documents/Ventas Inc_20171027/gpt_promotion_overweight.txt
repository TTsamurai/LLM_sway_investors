over by nearly 4% in the third quarter, which was ahead of our expectations. Additionally, our operators have done an excellent job of containing expenses, with overall expense increases at just 1.7% despite continued wage pressures. Our strong performance in high barrier-to-entry locations such as Los Angeles, Boston, and Toronto, as well as our growing NOI in Canada, demonstrates the value and resilience of our portfolio and the strength of our operators.

Looking at the overall financial results, we are pleased to report another quarter of earnings growth together with robust financial health. Income from continuing operations per share grew 5% to $0.44 compared to the third quarter of 2016, and normalized FFO per share in the third quarter grew 1% to $1.04 compared to the third quarter of 2016. We have also raised the midpoint of our guidance by 25 basis points to a range of 1.5% to 2% for same-store medical office assets in 2017. Overall, our total portfolio same-store cash NOI is anticipated to grow 2% to 2.5%, an increase of 25 basis points at the midpoint.

In conclusion, the company's strong performance and resilience in the face of industry challenges, combined with solid financial results, position Ventas as an attractive investment opportunity. The company's diverse portfolio, favorable lease protections, and strategic initiatives, such as the recently announced JV for over 70 senior housing assets, demonstrate the company's continued momentum and potential for growth. Based on the recent earnings call and financial results, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Ventas, as we project the company to deliver continued value and strong performance in the future.
