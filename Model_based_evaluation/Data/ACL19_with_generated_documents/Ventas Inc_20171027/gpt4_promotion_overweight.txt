**Ventas 2017 Third Quarter Financial Overview and Investment Promotion**

**Company Overview:**
Ventas, Inc., a leading real estate investment trust (REIT), continues to demonstrate outstanding performance and resilience in a dynamic market landscape. The consistent drive towards excellence translates into robust financial performance, strategic acquisitions, and operational efficacy, thereby making Ventas a compelling investment proposition.

**Financial Highlights:**
1. **Increased Guidance:** Following stronger than anticipated results in multiple portfolios, Ventas has confidently raised its full-year 2017 triple-net same store NOI guidance to a growth range of between 3% and 3.5%, and fine-tuned its SHOP portfolio same-store NOI guidance to indicate growth between 0.5% and 1.5%.
   
2. **Strong Earnings Growth:** Income from continuing operations rose by 5%, with per-share earnings reaching $0.44, underscored by a 1% growth in normalized FFO per share to $1.04 in the third quarter compared to the same period in 2016.

3. **Strategic Dispositions and Investments:** The successful sales of SKilled Nursing Facilities (SNF) from Kindred have significantly reduced Ventas's exposure to the SNF market, amplifying focus on higher growth sectors like life sciences and medical office buildings. The company invested over $80 million in life sciences and secured substantial gains exceeding $500 million on SNF dispositions.
   
4. **Operational Excellence:** Exceptional asset performance continues, with triple-net portfolio cash NOI increasing by 3.8% and major gains in life sciences and medical office occupancy rates. Strategic joint ventures underscore the adaptability and forward-thinking approach of Ventas’s management.

5. **Market Resiliency:** Despite industry-wide challenges, particularly in senior housing, Ventas’s competent operational strategies have yielded occupancy boosts and controlled expense trajectories. Additionally, high barriers-to-entry markets like Los Angeles, Boston, and Toronto continue to drive robust financial outcomes.

**Investment Merits:**
- **Leadership and Recognition:** The leadership under CEO Debbie, recognized globally for consecutive years by the Harvard Business Review, underscores robust corporate governance and visionary planning.
   
- **Diversified Portfolio:** Ventas’s strategic diversification across life sciences, senior living, and medical offices not only mitigates risks but also positions the company to benefit from multiple growth vectors. About 95% of the NOI is tied to leading health systems, showcasing the strength and stability of the revenue streams.

- **Financial Health:** The company’s sturdy financial framework, evidenced by a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.7 times and low total indebtedness to gross asset value of 39%, provides ample liquidity for ongoing and future projects.

- **Risk Management:** Effective risk management strategies were evident in the company's prompt and efficient handling of property damage and costs arising from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, with no recognized effect on normalized FFO.

**Recommendation:**
Given the solid growth trajectory, prudent asset management, and strategic financial steering, Ventas stands out as a compelling 'Overweight' investment opportunity. Investors are well-positioned to benefit from the company’s sustainable growth, sound operational strategies, and consistent shareholder returns in coming years. Therefore, I strongly recommend increasing holdings in Ventas, anticipating significant potential for enhanced value and continued market leadership.
