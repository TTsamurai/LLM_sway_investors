The company's triple-net business, seniors housing portfolio, post-acute business, and office reporting segment all showed positive growth and stability. From a financial metrics perspective, key points to note are:

- Triple-net portfolio showed a 3.8% same-store cash NOI growth in the third quarter, and seniors housing triple-net coverage remained steady at 1.3 times.
- The post-acute business experienced a slight decline in coverage but is expected to improve in the first half of 2018.
- The company's office reporting segment, comprised of life science and medical office businesses, also demonstrated strong performance with high occupancy rates and favorable credit profiles of tenants.
- Overall, the company's financial health improved, with net debt-to-EBITDA at 5.7 times, lower total indebtedness to gross asset value at 39%, and fixed charge coverage at 4.6 times.

Considering these positive financial metrics and the company's performance, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for the company. The growth in the triple-net business, the stability of the seniors housing portfolio, and the strong performance of the office reporting segment indicate a favorable outlook for the company's future earnings.
