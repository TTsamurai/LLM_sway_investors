achieve solid performance despite new competition. We continue to see strong performance in high barrier-to-entry markets like Los Angeles, Boston, and Toronto. The Canadian market has seen double-digit gains in NOI for two consecutive quarters, with high occupancy and strong price growth. The US market has experienced new competition in some areas, but overall, we have seen solid performance in our high barrier-to-entry markets. 

Our financial health remains robust, with improvements in net debt-to-EBITDA, total indebtedness to gross asset value, and steady fixed charge coverage. We have also completed value-creating sales of Kindred SNFs, reducing our SNF NOI exposure to nearly 1% and recognized gains exceeding $500 million from these sales. Our financial results for the third quarter show growth in income from continuing operations and normalized FFO per share, driven by accretive investments and improved property performance. 

Despite hurricane-related expenses of $10 million in the third quarter, our financial performance remains strong. We have raised our total portfolio same-store cash NOI guidance for the year and expect income from continuing operations and NAREIT FFO to be lower than previous guidance due to these expenses. However, our normalized FFO per share range remains unchanged from previous guidance. 

In summary, we are pleased with our financial performance in 2017 and are confident in our continued success. Our strong portfolio performance and robust financial health position us well for the future. Thank you for your time.
