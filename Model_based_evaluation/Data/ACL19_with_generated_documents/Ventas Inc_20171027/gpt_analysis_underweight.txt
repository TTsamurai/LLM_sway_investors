anchored by the strong leasing activity and rent increases in high barrier-to-entry markets such as Los Angeles, Boston, and Toronto. The strong performance in Canada, with double-digit gains in NOI, is attributed to high occupancy rates and effective pricing strategies. The company is also seeing favorable results in markets with new supply, with overall rate growth trending above the portfolio average despite price competition.

On the expense side, the company has seen impressive cost containment efforts, with overall expense increases kept at 1.7% despite wage pressures. The operators have been successful in flexing labor with occupancy and holding non-labor costs essentially flat. This has contributed to the strong performance of the overall portfolio.

The company's office reporting segment, representing 25% of Ventas' NOI, has also shown positive performance. The life science operating portfolio has maintained excellent total occupancy at 97.5%, with 75% of rent derived from investment-grade credits for companies with a billion-plus in equity market capitalization. The medical office business has seen a 1.5% increase in same-store cash NOI, with strong tenant retention rates.

Overall, the company seems to be in a strong financial position, with improvements in net debt-to-EBITDA, total indebtedness to gross asset value, and fixed charge coverage. The company has raised its same-store cash NOI guidance for 2017 and remains optimistic about its financial outlook.

Despite the positive performance, the company has recognized $10 million in direct costs from hurricanes Harvey and Irma in the third quarter of 2017. This has impacted income from continuing operations and normalized FFO but has been excluded from the reported NOI and normalized FFO, with appropriate coverage. The company has not recognized any insurance proceeds in its guidance due to the uncertain timing and amount.

In light of the overall performance and financial health, the company has provided updated 2017 guidance, anticipating 2% to 2.5% growth in total portfolio same-store cash NOI. The company expects income from continuing operations to range from $63 to $74 and NAREIT FFO to range from $4.07 to $4.12 per fully-diluted share. Additionally, normalized FFO per share is forecast to range from $4.13 to $4.16.

In conclusion, although the company has showcased strong performance and financial health, it is important for analysts to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance due to potential headwinds and challenges in certain segments, such as senior housing and post-acute business. The impact of new competition in select markets and ongoing wage pressures should be factored into the investment outlook for the company.
