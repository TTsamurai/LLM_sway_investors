back the other costs and provide that positive growth. On the expense side, we continue to see labor wage pressures and expect those to continue into 2018. We also anticipate benefits from patient criteria mitigation and labor cost containment. The company is entering into a joint venture for over 70 senior housing assets, which will impact the triple-net coverage and same-store supplemental reporting. The company's financial results for the third quarter show income growth and improved financial health, with property performance offsetting the impact of dispositions and loan repayments.
The company raised its same-store cash NOI guidance for the year, but also incurred $10 million in expenses from hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Overall, the company's guidance for the full year 2017 remains modestly lower than previous guidance, primarily due to the hurricane-related expenses. The company is pleased with its performance in 2017 and the tight, collaborative, and cohesive team. The company has emphasized its excellent track record and the CEO's recognition as one of the best performing CEOs in the world. 
However, there are concerns about labor wage pressures and cost containment, as well as the impact of new competition in select markets on occupancy and rate growth. The company's expectations for 2018 include continued labor pressures, stability in the triple-net same-store portfolio, and the impact of new deliveries on the supply of senior housing. The company is confident in its performance in Canada and high-barrier entry markets, but remains cautious about performance in secondary markets affected by new competition. 
Overall, the cautious perspective on the company suggests concerns about labor costs, the impact of new competition on occupancy and rate growth, and the potential effects of the joint venture on the company's financial reporting. Based on the company's recent earnings call, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended for investors.
