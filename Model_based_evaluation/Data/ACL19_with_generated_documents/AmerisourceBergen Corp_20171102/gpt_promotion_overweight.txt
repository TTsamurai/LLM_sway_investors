 but certainly we have more room to go there. And in terms of buy-side concessions, we're certainly working hard to balance the pricing with our customers. So, I feel pretty good about it. I think I heard Tim say earlier that the buy-side deflation is about 7% to 9% for 2018 and that's a range that we feel comfortable with. So I think we're in a good spot with our pricing negotiations. And certainly, as always, we'll continue to work and balance those relationships. Thank you for listening. We are excited about the future prospects of AmerisourceBergen and are confident in our ability to drive sustainable growth and deliver value to our shareholders.
