, but it's taking longer than we anticipated. In terms of the generic buy side, again, we've already been through this. I would say the number, the 7% to 9% is specifically calculated for our business and remains fairly stable. I think importantly, as generics continue to expand, we continue to – able to kind of offset some of that with increasing volumes and optimizing our margins. Maybe just as a point of discussion, an opportunity for us, as Steve mentioned, is certainly shift more towards pro-generics. So we're making good progress with that, but still is a headwind in the overall business. And finally, generic drug launches. This is relatively flat, about equal to 2017. Steve's guidance has been more of a rotation. And so I think importantly, just to highlight, we just need to continue to successfully execute our plan and with our ability to do that, we have the ability to drive sustainable growth and I think most importantly, generate significant shareholder value. So we're not – working on all three of those key assumptions. And finally this the DOJ thing. I think we're in good shape there. So just closing here, Bob: We're making good progress on our business segments. We're continuing to grow. We're being more efficient and more effective with our capital deployment. We've continued to invest. Whether it be distribution centers or technology. I think the other thing to highlight is certainly thoughtful pricing of our customer contracts. And I think importantly, again, we provide leading edge solutions to our customers which ultimately benefits the patient and is a good competitive differentiator for ABC. And hi, Peggy. And thanks for the question. On the tax code, I'll just tell you our guidance of 32% to 33%. And what we – we do have some tax planning above that. So the 32% to 33% guidance I gave is full year, but Q4 – we do have more U.S. income than we had anticipated. So the tax rate in Q4 is higher. So really not – anything to do with the technical law change. That’s our ongoing tax planning that you’ve seen. There's a lot of seasonality in our business. Certainly, our fourth quarter is always our strongest and most profitable quarter. Totally, I think it's very consistent with what we've communicated before. I mean we need a – we’ve – we’ve given guidance above the 32% to 33%, our tax initiatives will be less. The Q4 happens to have some big part of this and also be U.S. income. And so we always said, 2018 tax rate was going to be higher. So it's a good point and I appreciate it. Yes. We had a new DC in Q1 that realized some operating expenses when it went live. As we moved into Q2, we have two new DCs that went live in Q2. So there were some costs associated with that. And of course, as we move into Q3, we had four new DCs that went live. Again, a couple of one-time costs and then some of those higher costs. And we end Q4 with five existing DCs going live and these are some of the one-time costs. But as I mentioned earlier, we built these incremental costs into our 2018 OpEx guidance. So those are the 4% to 6% range. I think the last quarter was the very last part of that DC. And I said the revenue match now with the Rite Aid business was very good in Q4, so it was a very clean quarter for us. Okay, everybody, thank you for joining us today and again, I'll appreciate that. So back to Keri. Thank you, Eric. We appreciate your questions.

Report:
Based on the company's recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on AmerisourceBergen Corporation. The company's financial results and guidance indicate a potential slow in growth, with increased operating expenses, reduced revenue from specific product segments, and a higher tax rate. The adjusted operating income for fiscal 2018 is expected to grow between 3% and 5%, showing a decline in growth rates compared to previous periods. Additionally, the company's tax initiatives will be less in the coming year, leading to a higher tax rate.

Furthermore, the consolidation of legacy drug and specialty operating segments in September 2017 and the movement of businesses between reportable segments may have an impact on the company's operating results. The company's Commercialization Services and Animal Health group is projected to experience slower growth in fiscal 2018 due to the timing of and expected operating expenses associated with a new technology system implementation.

Overall, the company's robust financial performance in fiscal 2017 may not be sustained in fiscal 2018. The impact of lower Hepatitis C revenues, reduced operating income, and slower growth in certain business segments present a cautious outlook for potential investors. Therefore, it is advised to take an 'underweight' investment stance on AmerisourceBergen Corporation until there is clear evidence of sustainable growth and improved financial performance.
