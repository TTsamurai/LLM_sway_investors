 in that area. And ultimately, as you think about the year, we've got to really â€“ we've got to grow order lines, we've got to increase those margins and we've got to really work hard on sell-side efforts and making sure we're getting compensated fairly across all classes of drugs. So that's kind of our focus as we think about 2018 and really beyond. Thank you, Keri. I hope these insights will be helpful in providing a comprehensive future outlook report for the company. While the growth rates and revenue achievements are impressive, there are headwinds to be mindful of, particularly in the hep C market and potential impacts from manufacturer pricing practices. However, the investment in technology systems, ongoing discussions for fair compensation, and the strong focus on customer compliance rates and efficient operations demonstrate a commitment to sustainable growth. With the onboarding of the Walgreens Rite Aid business and a continued focus on PROGenerics and volume growth in specialty drugs, there is potential for continued revenue and margin improvement. The guidance for modest share buybacks and strong free cash flow projections also indicate solid financial strength and flexibility. Based on these insights and financial metrics, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended for the company. Thank you for the opportunity to present this future outlook report.
