# Future Outlook Report for AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC)

## Investment Stance: Overweight

### Summary:

AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC), a prominent player in wholesale pharmaceutical distribution and services, demonstrates a robust strategic position amid the evolving U.S. healthcare landscape. The company’s performance in fiscal 2017 and the outlined expectations for 2018 suggest a favorable growth outlook, despite challenges such as drug price deflation and regulatory pressures. We recommend an overweight position based on ABC’s solid fundamentals, strategic customer relationships, and growth in specialty distribution and services.

### Fiscal Year 2017 Performance Highlights:

1. **Revenue Growth**: ABC reported a 4% growth in revenue to $39 billion despite headwinds from hepatitis C revenue reductions and fewer business days compared to the last fiscal year. Adjusting for these factors, growth was approximately 6.5%.

2. **Earnings Performance**: Adjusted diluted EPS increased to $1.33 in Q4, marking a 5% growth for the fiscal year, largely in line with expectations, despite slight impacts from hurricane disruptions.

3. **Operational Excellence**: The company achieved record free cash flow of $1 billion, signaling strong operational execution and efficient capital management.

4. **Segment Performance**:
   - Pharmaceutical Distribution: Showed consistent strength despite ongoing brand-to-generic conversions, contributing significantly to the revenue stream with a 4% increase.
   - Specialty Distribution and Services: Continues to perform exceptionally, with revenue growth of over 10% driven by volume increases in oncology and other specialized areas.

### Fiscal Year 2018 Outlook and Strategy:

1. **Revenue and Earnings Guidance**:
   - Expected consolidated revenue growth of 7-9%, driven partly by the full integration of the Walgreens Rite Aid stores.
   - Adjusted EPS is projected to be in the range of $5.90 to $6.15, anticipating stronger performance in the latter half of the year as the company benefits from new business volume.

2. **Strategic Investments**:
   - ABC remains committed to strategic investments in technology and distribution efficiency to enhance customer experience and operational agility.
   - Significant capital will be directed towards completing the distribution network expansion and upgrading technological infrastructure such as the Fusion system in consulting services and Nova logistics for the World Courier business.

3. **Operational Focus Areas**:
   - Enhancing PROGenerics business volumes and maintaining aggressive cost management in generics sourcing.
   - Managing operating expenses effectively, expected to grow by 4-6%, paired with strategic revenue enhancements.

4. **Market Positioning**:
   - ABC aims to fortify its market leadership in pharmaceutical distribution and expand its footprint in specialty services, leveraging its scale and integrated service model.

### Investment Considerations:

- **Growth Catalysts**: The onboarding of new business from the Rite Aid integration and growth in the high-margin specialty sector are expected to drive revenue and margin expansion.
- **Risk Mitigation**: ABC’s diversified business model and strategic customer engagements provide a hedge against isolated market downturns and regulatory risks.
- **Capital Allocation**: The company’s prudent capital allocation for share repurchases and strategic investments should support earnings per share growth and shareholder returns.

### Conclusion:

Given AmerisourceBergen’s consistent operational execution, strategic growth initiatives, and strong financial health, we are confident in the company's ability to navigate market challenges and capitalize on opportunities. The anticipated integration benefits from the Walgreens Rite Aid deal, coupled with ongoing advancements in specialty pharmaceuticals, position ABC favorably for sustainable growth. Thus, an overweight investment stance is warranted.
