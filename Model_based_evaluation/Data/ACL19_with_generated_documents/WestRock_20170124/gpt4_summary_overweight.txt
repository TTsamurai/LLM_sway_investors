#### Investment Stance: Overweight

#### Executive Summary:
WestRock has demonstrated strong strategic and financial acumen as evidenced by their recent earnings and activities discussed in their latest earnings conference call. The management has successfully executed strategic mergers and acquisitions, navigated input cost fluctuations, and pushed forward with significant deals that should foster growth. The company's solid performance in sales, coupled with smart capital allocation strategies, supports an overweight stance for investors.

#### Key Financial Highlights from Q1:
- Sales reached $3.4 billion.
- Adjusted EBITDA stood at $490 million, translating to a 14.2% margin.
- Adjusted earnings per diluted share were reported at $0.47.
- Despite the impacts of rising input costs and other external challenges, effective productivity programs within the corrugated segment have begun offsetting these pressures, indicating strong management execution.
- Announced container board price increases are beginning to positively impact the financials.
- Noteworthy is the $50 million ongoing benefit expected from productivity improvements and strategic cost management.

#### Strategic Business Moves:
- WestRock has more aggressively formed its core through selling non-core businesses and acquiring strategically aligned businesses such as Multi Packaging Solutions (MPS).
- MPS acquisition for $2.28 billion enhances WestRock’s consumer packaging segment, diversifying its product offerings and broadening its market reach in high-growth sectors like healthcare and cosmetics.
- Projected synergies and performance improvements from the MPS deal amount to $85 million.
- Post MPS acquisition, the combined company's capabilities will leverage growth opportunities stemming from market trends towards customization and differentiation in packaging needs.

#### Future Outlook and Guidance:
- WestRock forecasts stable demand but continues to note input cost inflation as a persistent challenge.
- The company is set on a path to further enhance its EBITDA margins through continued operational improvements and synergies from recent acquisitions.
- Pro forma capitalization remains strong post-MPS transaction with leverage at 2.55 times including synergies.
