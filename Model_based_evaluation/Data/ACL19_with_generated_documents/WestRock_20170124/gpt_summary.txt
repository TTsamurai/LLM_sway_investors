Based on the recent earnings conference call transcripts, the key financial metrics of WestRock for the first quarter include a sales of $3.4 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $490 million, producing a margin of 14.2%, and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.47. The decline in adjusted EBITDA was attributed to higher input costs, the impact of price reductions, Hurricane Matthew, and a legal settlement. The company is focusing on monetizing its land and development portfolio, as evidenced by the sale of its Home, Health & Beauty business to Silgan for expected proceeds of $1 billion after tax and transaction fees. The recent strategic announcement involves the acquisition of Multi Packaging Solutions for a total enterprise value of $2.28 billion, to be funded through cash on hand, the proceeds from the sale, and existing borrowing capacity.

In terms of segment performance, the corrugated packaging business delivered solid results with a 2.2% increase in box shipments and a strong performance in North America with adjusted EBITDA margins of 15.8%. On the other hand, the consumer packaging segment generated stable results with higher input costs offset by strong productivity performance. The company confirmed stable demand and continued input cost inflation in the forecast.

The acquisition of Multi Packaging Solutions is seen as a strategic and financial transaction that aligns well with WestRock's vision to be a premier partner and provider of winning solutions for its customers. MPS is expected to strengthen the company's portfolio, enhance its customer offerings, and enhance its potential for future growth opportunities. The financials of the acquisition are deemed compelling, with an expected earnings and cash flow accretion, making it a superior return profile when compared to repurchasing shares. The company's robust and consistent free cash flows, balanced capital allocation approach, and track record of solid execution provide confidence in its ability to deliver successful integration of MPS into WestRock.
