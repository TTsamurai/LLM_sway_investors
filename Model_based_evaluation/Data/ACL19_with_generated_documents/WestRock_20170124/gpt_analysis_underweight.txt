Based on the materials gathered from the company's recent earnings conference call transcript, key insights and financial metrics have been identified to justify an 'underweight' investment stance for WestRock. Despite the company's optimism and strategic acquisitions, including the merger between Rock-Tenn and MWV, the purchase of Cenveo Packaging and SP Fiber, and the agreement to acquire Multi Packaging Solutions, there are several factors to consider.

Firstly, the company reported a decline in adjusted EBITDA from the prior year due to higher input costs, unfavorable headwinds such as price reductions, Hurricane Matthew, and a legal settlement. Additionally, while the management expressed confidence in improving results in the corrugated segment, there were challenges in the consumer packaging segment with stable results and lower volume, offset by strong productivity performance.

Furthermore, the acquisition of Multi Packaging Solutions, while strategically compelling, comes with a significant enterprise value of $2.28 billion, representing 9.6 times trailing 12-months adjusted EBITDA and 7.1 times after including full run rate synergies and performance improvements. This substantial valuation raises concerns about the company's ability to generate adequate returns for its stockholders.

In addition, the company's credit capacity may become strained following the completion of the acquisition, and there is uncertainty regarding the regulatory approvals required for the transaction, which further adds to the investment risk. Despite the management's confidence in the integration process and the potential synergies, the success of the acquisition remains uncertain, especially given the volatility in the markets and the company's uneven performance.

Therefore, considering the challenges faced by the company and the significant financial commitment associated with the acquisition, an 'underweight' investment stance may be warranted at this time. It is recommended to closely monitor the company's performance and the successful execution of its strategic initiatives before considering a more favorable investment stance.
