Here are several key insights and financial metrics from the conference call transcript for Sealed Air Corporation:

1. Strong free cash flow and earnings per share performance were highlighted for the quarter and the year, with $631 million in free cash flow in 2016.

2. Q4 organic sales growth was 2%, driven by an increase of approximately 4% in volume in North America.

3. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 80 basis points over the last year to 22.3%.

4. Overall organic growth was 1.3% in 2016, with challenges in Latin America, the Middle East, the Australian beef market, and the industrial world.

5. 2017 net sales outlook projects approximately 2.5% constant dollar growth, with 3% growth for Food Care and Product Care, and 1% for Diversey Care. These projections reflect the short-term impact of the expiration of the brand licensing agreement with SC Johnson.

7. Diversey sales are expected to increase approximately 1% on a constant dollar basis in 2017, with adjusted EBITDA margins in line with 2016 results and sales growth expected to be higher excluding SC Johnson.

8. Product Care division experienced essentially unchanged net sales on a constant dollar basis compared to 2015, with adjusted EBITDA margins increasing to 21.8% in 2016.

9. The company made significant investments in new products and R&D, positioning new solutions in the marketplace and anticipating delayed growth by a few quarters.

10. Sealed Air is pursuing a tax-free spin-off of New Diversey, with plans to explore strategic alternatives including the potential sale of New Diversey. The company expects flat sales and EBITDA in 2017 due to a short-term impact of the SC Johnson contract expiration.

Overall, the company has faced challenges in certain regions and industries but is proactively focusing on innovation, disruptive products, and leveraging growth opportunities in e-commerce and hygiene solutions. Despite short-term challenges, Sealed Air holds a positive outlook for 2017 and is confident in its long-term growth prospects.
