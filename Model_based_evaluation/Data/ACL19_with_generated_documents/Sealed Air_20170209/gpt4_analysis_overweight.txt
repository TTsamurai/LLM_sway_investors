### Future Outlook Report for Sealed Air Corporation

#### Executive Summary
Sealed Air has shown a commendable performance in 2016 despite several global economic setbacks. The company's proactive restructuring efforts, adept management of capital expenditures, and a keen focus on innovating across divisions have paved the way for its robust financial health in the upcoming year. With strategic initiatives and product innovations set to roll out in 2017 particularly in the Food Care and Product Care divisions, Sealed Air is positioned to achieve not only stronger financial results but also an enhanced market position. In light of these factors, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Sealed Air stock.

#### Key Financial Highlights
- **Free Cash Flow**: Sealed Air generated a significant $631 million in free cash flow in 2016 after accounting for $276 million in capital expenditures and $66 million in restructuring costs.
- **Earnings Per Share**: There was an achievement of $0.76 adjusted EPS in Q4 2016, culminating to $2.66 per share for the full year, which benefited from a share repurchase program.
- **Sales Growth**: Organic sales grew 3% for Food Care and remained stable in Diversey Care during Q4 2016, driven by favorable pricing and volume increases.

#### Divisional Performance and Outlook
- **Food Care**: Increased by 3% in constant dollars largely attributed to gains in protein packaging and North America hygiene solutions. Projections for 2017 expect a continuous improvement, especially from the ‘Change the Game’ initiatives like OptiDure and Darfresh, which will potentially increase both sales and EBITDA growth rates above the market average.
- **Product Care**: Despite challenges in the top-line growth due to global industrial slowdown, there was an 80 basis points increase in adjusted EBITDA margins to 22.3%. With significant innovations such as I-Pack and FloWrap, the company anticipates stronger sales and margin expansion in 2017.
- **Diversey Care**: Exhibited resilience with a 3% increase in net sales in constant dollars for Q4, but a slight projected growth of 1% in 2017 due to the expiration of the SC Johnson brand licensing agreement. However, underlying growth excluding SCJ effects is expected to reach record highs.

#### Strategic Movements
- **Spin-off of New Diversey**: Exploring strategic alternatives including a potential sale could unlock substantial value and enable sharper focus on core businesses. This move is indicative of Sealed Air's commitment to streamlining its operations and enhancing shareholder value.

#### Market and Economic Impact
The global economic slowdown particularly impacted industrial production and growth rates in core markets like Latin America and the Middle East. However, Sealed Air’s forward-looking strategies and robust product pipeline are expected to mitigate these adverse effects. The company is well-prepared to leverage e-commerce growth despite broader industrial challenges.

#### Investment Thesis
Given the strong fundamentals demonstrated by Sealed Air, coupled with strategic initiatives aimed at business optimization and innovation, there is confidence in the company’s ability to outperform market expectations. We recommend an 'overweight' stance, anticipating that the strategic actions undertaken by the company, including potential divestitures and the introduction of high-margin products, will yield significant returns.

#### Risks
The primary risks include greater-than-expected adverse impacts from global economic volatility, slower-than-anticipated adoption of new products, and potential complications in executing the spin-off of New Diversey.

### Conclusion
As Sealed Air progresses through 2017 with a robust strategy and promising innovations, its financial and operational outlook is expected to strengthen. This positions Sealed Air as an appealing prospect for investors seeking growth and stability in a volatile market environment.
