Based on the recent earnings call, the company Sealed Air has shown strong performance in free cash flow and earnings per share. In 2016, they generated $631 million in free cash flow, with significant upside relative to guidance, driven by a strong focus on working capital. The company also delivered $0.76 in adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter and $2.66 per share in 2016.

The Food Care and Diversey Care divisions showed organic sales growth of approximately 3% and adjusted EPS growth of 16% in the fourth quarter, reflecting positive volume trends and favorable price mix. The hygiene business also saw an increase in volume and favorable price mix on a global basis. However, Product Care faced challenges with top-line constant dollar growth, which impacted adjusted EBITDA performance.

Looking ahead to 2017, Sealed Air is forecasting total net sales growth of 2.5% in constant dollars, with a focus on leveraging their strong global presence in Food Care, capitalizing on e-Commerce opportunities, and rebuilding their consumer brands business. The company is confident in their plans for growth, despite challenges in the global economic and geopolitical environment.

Additionally, Sealed Air announced plans for the separation of New Diversey, pursuing a tax-free spin-off and exploring strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of New Diversey. The company's outlook for 2017 includes stable pricing, with an emphasis on volume growth and a focus on mitigating the impact of expiring agreements.

Overall, Sealed Air is focused on driving growth through innovation and disruptive products, while also addressing challenges in the industrial world and making strategic business decisions to unlock meaningful value for customers and shareholders. The company acknowledges the critical year ahead and is prepared for the opportunities and challenges it may bring.
