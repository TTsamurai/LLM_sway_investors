**Strategic Concerns:**

- Industrial GDP weakness globally has countered the benefits from strong e-commerce volume growth.

**Operational and Strategic Initiatives:**
- The company is pushing forward with the separation of New Diversey, exploring all strategic options including a potential sale, to help unlock value.
- Investment in innovation and disruptive products continues, with new launches across divisions anticipated to stimulate growth.
- Initiatives such as ‘Change the Game’ in Food Care and direct sales investments in Diversey Care are key focus areas.

**Market and Economic Predictions:**
- Continued challenges in global GDP growth are expected, with the company planning conservatively around industrial markets not improving significantly in 2017.
- Volatility in resin prices and other raw materials are factors in cost management and pricing strategies.

**Investment Stance: Underweight**
- The company's subdued organic growth, coupled with significant challenges due to economic conditions and strategic uncertainties in divisions like Diversey Care, contribute to the underweight stance.
- Despite solid cost management and some divisional strengths, the overall slower growth trajectory and market challenges raise concerns about near-term profitability and growth prospects.
- Investors should monitor the execution of new product launches and strategic moves such as the New Diversey separation for future reassessment of the investment stance.
