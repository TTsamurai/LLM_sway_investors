 in Slide 5 and 6 of the earnings call transcript, the company reported organic sales growth of 2% in the fourth quarter and 1.3% for the full year. This was mainly driven by positive volume trends in North America and EMEA. However, the company expressed disappointment in the lack of industrial GDP growth and challenges in Latin America, the Middle East, and the Australian beef market.

Key financial metrics indicate that Food Care delivered $3.2 billion in net sales with 2% organic sales growth in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 20.5% of net sales, driven by higher beef volume and market share gains. Diversey Care reported 3% organic growth in the fourth quarter and 2% for the full year, with adjusted EBITDA margins increasing to 13% in the quarter and 12.8% for the full year. Product Care's net sales on a constant dollar basis remained unchanged, but adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 22.3% in the quarter and 21.8% for 2016.

Looking ahead to 2017, the company forecasts approximately 2.5% constant dollar growth in net sales, with expectations for accelerated growth in Food Care, continued focus on e-commerce growth, and plans to rebuild the consumer brands business. The separation of New Diversey was also mentioned as a critical step in the company's transformation, and the potential sale of New Diversey is being explored as a strategic alternative.

In summary, the company's financial performance in 2016 showed solid progress in free cash flow, EPS, and EBITDA margins despite challenges in certain markets. The focus on volume growth and disruptive product innovations bodes well for future growth, and the potential separation and sale of New Diversey are viewed as opportunities to unlock meaningful value for customers and shareholders. Therefore, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance based on the company's strong financial metrics, growth strategies, and potential value creation through strategic actions.
