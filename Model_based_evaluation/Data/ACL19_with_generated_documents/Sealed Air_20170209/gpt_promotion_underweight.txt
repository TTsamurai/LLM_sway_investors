In summary, the recent earnings call from Sealed Air indicates that the company experienced lower than expected organic growth in 2016, primarily due to reduced industrial GDP and economic challenges in Latin America and the Middle East. The company's outlook for 2017 is cautious, with expectations for only modest sales growth. Additionally, the separation of the New Diversey division is underway, with potential strategic alternatives, including a potential sale, being explored.

Based on this information, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on Sealed Air. The company's challenges with organic growth, particularly in the Product Care division, and the uncertain economic and geopolitical environment in several regions suggest a potential for limited upside in the near term. The potential separation of the New Diversey division also introduces uncertainty and may impact the overall financial performance of the company. Therefore, a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company's future performance is warranted.
