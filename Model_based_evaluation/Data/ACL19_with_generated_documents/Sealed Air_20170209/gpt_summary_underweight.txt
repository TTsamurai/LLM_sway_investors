. Our total net sales outlook for 2017 of 2.5% constant dollar growth reflects approximately 3% of growth for Food Care and Product Care, and 1% for Diversey Care, which accounts for the short-term impact of the expiration of the brand licensing agreement with SC Johnson. Internally, the actions that we're taking to drive growth in 2017 are purposeful. We will leverage our strong global presence in Food Care and continue growing at a faster pace than the protein packaging markets. We will capitalize on the e-Commerce opportunity with our disruptive technologies. And the underlying constant dollar sales growth for Diversey Care, excluding SCJ, is expected to be at an all-time high in 2017 and our plans to rebuild our consumer brands business is very well underway.

In summary, our analysis of the earnings conference call transcript reveals several key financial metrics that concern us as financial analysts. Despite some positive highlights such as free cash flow and earnings per share performance, the overall organic growth of 1.3% in 2016 falls short of expectations. We believe that the impact of the economic and geopolitical environment in Latin America and the Middle East, the depth of the downcycle in the Australian beef market, and the weakness in the industrial world pose significant challenges to future growth prospects. Additionally, the expiration of the brand licensing agreement with SC Johnson has a short-term impact on Diversey Care, which accounts for the lower growth forecast for 2017.

Based on these factors, we adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for Sealed Air. We have concerns about the company's ability to drive significant growth in the near term, particularly in the Product Care division, which has been negatively impacted by declines in the industrial environment. The uncertainty surrounding the potential sale or separation of New Diversey further adds to our cautious stance. We believe that investors should carefully consider the identified challenges and uncertainties before making investment decisions in Sealed Air.
