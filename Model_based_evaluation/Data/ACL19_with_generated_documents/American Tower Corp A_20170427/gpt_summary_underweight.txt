 Summary: 

The company reported strong results in the first quarter, with significant growth across key financial metrics including consolidated property revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and consolidated AFFO per share. Organic tenant billings growth was strong, particularly in international markets. The company also increased its common stock dividend by 22% and resumed its share purchase program, buying back over $400 million of its stock so far this year. 

The company expects strong organic growth in 2017 in both U.S. and international markets, with consolidated organic tenant billings growth in the 7% to 8% range. However, there are some concerns about churn rates in international markets, particularly in India, due to ongoing carrier consolidation. The company is also cautious about potential leasing expectations from the completed incentive auction and the impact from FirstNet deployments in the United States. 

The increased deployment of capital and discretionary capital allocation indicate a strong financial position, but the company's exposure to international markets and concerns about churn rates may warrant an 'underweight' investment stance.
