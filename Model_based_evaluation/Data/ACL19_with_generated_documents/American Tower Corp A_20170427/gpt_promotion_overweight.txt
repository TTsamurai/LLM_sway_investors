Based on the recent earnings call, the company has posted strong results, including double digit growth in key metrics and accelerated organic tenant billings growth. They have also continued to delever and have increased their common stock dividend by 22%. In addition, they have closed on an acquisition in France, launched operations in their 15th global market, and built over 460 new sites globally.

The company's strong revenue trends have led to double digit growth in adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO for the 16th consecutive quarter. They have raised their outlook for property revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and consolidated AFFO and consolidated AFFO per share. They have also continued to delever while growing their common stock dividend and purchasing over $400 million worth of shares.

In terms of capital allocation, the company has deployed approximately $1.2 billion of capital in the first quarter. They have spent over $500 million for acquisitions, $225 million for stock repurchases, and over $150 million for discretionary CapEx. They have also declared about $291 million in common and preferred dividends in the quarter.

The company's play book for capital allocation has been consistent for the last ten years, focusing on driving the highest NPV and value. They continue to evaluate opportunities for M&A in the markets they are doing business in and look for opportunities that exceed their risk-adjusted cost of capital.

In summary, the company has extended its track record of delivering double-digit growth across key financial metrics in the first quarter and has a sizable amount of incremental borrowing capacity which could be deployed to generate incremental value. Based on this information, I highly recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company as it continues to show strong growth and solid performance.
