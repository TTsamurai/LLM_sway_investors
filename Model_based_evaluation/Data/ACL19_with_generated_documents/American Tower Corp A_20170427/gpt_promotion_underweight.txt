Thank you for sharing the transcripts from the recent earnings call. After carefully analyzing the information presented, I would like to offer a cautious and skeptical perspective on the company's performance and outlook. Despite the company's claims of strong results, I am hesitant to recommend an "underweight" investment stance for the following reasons:

- The company's growth is heavily reliant on acquisitions and international expansion, which can present integration and market-specific risks.
- The increase in acquisition spend and share buybacks may impact the company's ability to maintain financial stability and growth in the long term.
- The company's outlook for 2017, despite being raised, still includes assumptions about potential impact from future network deployments and auctions, which introduces uncertainty into the forecast.
- The higher churn levels in India and the anticipation of accelerated churn in the second half of the year indicate potential instability in the company's international markets, which may impact future growth.

Overall, while the company has shown consistent growth in key financial metrics, the reliance on acquisitions, international expansion, and assumptions about future market conditions creates a level of uncertainty that warrants a cautious investment stance. Therefore, I recommend approaching investment in the company with caution and potentially reducing exposure to the company's stock.
