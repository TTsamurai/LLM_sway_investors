Given the strong performance detailed in the earnings call, we are adopting an 'overweight' stance on investment in this company. Here are some key financial metrics that support this stance:

1.  Consolidated Organic Tenant Billings Growth accelerated to 8.6%.
2.  Consolidated property revenue grew by nearly 26% in the first quarter, driven by strong international growth. International Organic Tenant Billings Growth was over 14% on a consolidated basis.
3.  Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated AFFO grew nearly 20%.
4.  Conservative leverage management, with net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA at 4.6 times.
5.  Robust capital deployment strategy, including growth in common stock dividend by about 22% and over $400 million spent on stock buybacks.

Based on the positive outlook for 2017 and the company's strong track record of growth, we believe the stock presents a compelling investment opportunity and recommend an overweight position.
