Based on the recent earnings call, it appears that the company is experiencing a timing-related shortfall in sales and profit levels for the current quarter. While they expect to make up for this shortfall in the fourth quarter, it is important to note that the earnings per share was slightly lower than last year's amount. Additionally, the cash return to stockholders was strong, and the backlog level increased to a record $104 billion.

However, it is important to exercise caution in investing in this company based on the following factors:
- The F-35 program, which has been a significant growth driver, experienced a lower-than-expected sales outlook for this year, and the impact of this can be seen in the reduced sales outlook for 2018.
- The company's segment operating profit and earnings per share for next year are not showing significant growth, as the F-35 issues are impacting this, with most of the growth projected for 2019 and 2020.
- The company's updated outlook for the year does not show substantial improvement in key financial metrics.

Considering these factors, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on this company, as the current challenges in the F-35 program and the modest growth outlook for the next year suggest a cautious approach to investing in this stock. It is important to closely monitor the company's performance in the upcoming quarters to reassess their investment potential.
