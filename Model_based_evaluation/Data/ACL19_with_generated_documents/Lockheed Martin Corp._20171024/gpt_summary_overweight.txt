Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, the company's financial performance in the quarter was solid, with improving prospects for the rest of the year and beyond. The sales of $12.2 billion and segment operating profit of $1.2 billion were slightly lower than expected, but the company anticipates making up for this shortfall in the fourth quarter. The earnings per share of $3.24 were in line with expectations. Cash from operations was very strong at $1.8 billion for the quarter, and the company returned $1 billion to stockholders. The company achieved a record backlog level of $104 billion, positioning it for sustained long-term growth.

The company is increasing its outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share, and cash from operations. The sales outlook is increased by $200 million, and the segment operating profit outlook is increased by $20 million. The earnings per share outlook is increased by $0.55. The company's cash from operations outlook is increased by $200 million, to be equal to or greater than $6.2 billion.

The company's new revenue recognition methodology, ASC 606, is expected to affect the 2017 results, with sales under the new methodology expected to be about 2% lower than the current methodology. Segment operating profit will be comparable under both the old and new methodologies, with an expected increase in segment operating margin to around 10.3% under the new standard. The preliminary trend information for 2018 under the new revenue recognition methodology indicates an expected increase in sales of about 2% over the restated 2017 level, with a segment operating margin expected to increase to a range of 10.3% to 10.5%.

The company's three-year goals for cash from operations have been revised, with an expected total of $16.5 billion over the years 2015 to 2017, and a new goal to generate more than $15 billion for the years 2017 to 2019. This outlook takes into account higher required pension contributions over this timeframe.

Overall, the company's financial performance in the quarter was strong, and it is increasing its outlook for key financial metrics, with a record backlog positioning it for sustained long-term growth. The company will continue to have robust cash flow, even with the higher pension contributions in the future, and will maintain a balanced approach to cash deployment.
