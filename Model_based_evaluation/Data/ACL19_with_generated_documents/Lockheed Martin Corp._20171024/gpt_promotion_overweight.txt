Based on the company's recent earnings call, it is clear that there is positive momentum and growth potential for the company in the future. We have seen solid performance and improving prospects for the rest of the year and beyond. Sales, operating profit, earnings per share, and cash from operations are all increasing, showing confidence in the company's performance. The company's record backlog level of $104 billion positions it for sustained long-term growth. Furthermore, the company's free cash flow remains robust, even with higher pension contributions in the future.

The F-35 program is experiencing significant growth, with a 20% increase in sales in the past year and continued growth projected for 2018. Other business areas also show growth potential, with new wins in Missiles and Fire Control and Space Systems.

The company's revised outlook for key financial metrics for 2017 and 2018 demonstrates a positive outlook, with improvements in sales, segment operating profit, and cash from operations. The company is aiming for sustained long-term growth, and investors should consider an 'overweight' investment stance based on the company's strong performance and future prospects.
