. Now, I will summarize the key financial metrics from the transcript:

1. Fulfillment Options: Target has introduced multiple new fulfillment options including in-store pickup, Drive Up service, same-day delivery, next-day delivery through Target Restock, and ship-from-store capability. This has resulted in an increase in the amount of digital volume handled by Target's stores, with stores already fulfilling more than half of total digital volume through pickup and ship-from-store capabilities.

2. Fulfillment Capabilities: Target Restock has been ramping up quickly, with the average value of a Restock order about 50% larger than an average store transaction. Same-day delivery has seen enthusiastic response from guests, with basket sizes for delivery transactions running six to nine times the average transaction. Drive Up service has received positive guest survey scores and is outperforming average wait time goals.

3. Supply Chain Improvement: Target is focused on improving the speed, accuracy, and reliability of its entire supply chain in order to achieve the goal of reliably delivering any item in the network to most areas in the U.S. in two days or less.

4. Stores and Remodeling: Target is investing in new stores and remodeling existing locations to reach new neighborhoods and elevate the overall shopping experience. Remodeled stores have seen an average sales acceleration of 2% to 4%.

5. Labor and Fulfillment: Target is investing in labor in its stores to support fulfillment, training, and having experts in the store. It is also building teams to handle fulfillment in the backroom, while utilizing the stores as a hub for fulfilling guests' needs.

6. Inventory and In-Stocks: Target has taken intentional inventory positions in advance of the fourth quarter in categories like electronics and Hearth and Hand. It continues to work on fundamental capabilities in the supply chain to improve overall inventory placement and in-stocks.

7. Profitability of Fulfillment Options: Fulfillment options closer to the store, such as in-store pickup and Drive Up, are more economically beneficial for Target. Same-day delivery is more expensive, but has seen large, highly profitable transactions.

Overall, the introduction of new fulfillment options and investment in store labor and remodeling is aimed at improving guest experience, increasing sales, and driving strong returns on investment for Target.
