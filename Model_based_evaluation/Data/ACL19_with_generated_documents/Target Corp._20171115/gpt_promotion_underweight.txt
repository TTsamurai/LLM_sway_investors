Based on the recent earnings call, it is clear that Target is making significant investments in new fulfillment options, such as in-store pickup, Drive Up, same-day delivery, next-day delivery, and ship-from-store capabilities. These capabilities are aimed at increasing the speed and reliability of their supply chain in order to meet the growing demand for digital orders. While these investments are promising, there are some cautionary points to consider.

First, as the company scales up these new fulfillment capabilities, it will require additional labor support in stores to handle fulfillment and backroom operations. This could potentially add to operating costs and impact overall profitability.

Second, the company's focus on improving in-stock levels and inventory placement is an ongoing journey. While progress has been made, there are still concerns about the reliability and accuracy of their supply chain, which could impact the customer experience and lead to potential out-of-stock issues.

Furthermore, the company's focus on increasing the speed and convenience of delivery options, such as same-day and next-day delivery, may come with higher costs, which could impact profitability. While the company believes that guests understand and are willing to pay for these convenience services, there may be variable market demand for these higher-cost delivery options.

Overall, while Target's investments in new fulfillment capabilities and store enhancements show promise, there are potential challenges and risks to consider. As a result, it may be prudent to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company until there is greater clarity on how these initiatives will impact overall financial performance.
