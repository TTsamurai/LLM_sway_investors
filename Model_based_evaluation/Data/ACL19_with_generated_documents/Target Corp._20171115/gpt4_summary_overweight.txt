The company plans to ship over 30 million units in the peak four weeks of the holiday season, up from 18 million units last year.

3. **Supply Chain Enhancements:** The company added a new flow center in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, improving the speed, accuracy, and reliability of the supply chain. This facility operates with a startup approach, rapidly building and iterating solutions, and serves high-sales small format stores in New York City, optimizing quick replenishment cycles.

4. **Store Performance and Investments:**

5. **Economic Impacts and Customer Response:** 
   - High customer satisfaction with new services like Drive Up, evident from outstanding guest survey scores.
   - Recognition of additional labor and operational costs linked with increased fulfillment options, balanced by the strategic use of stores as fulfillment hubs to control costs and enhance service efficiency.

**Future Outlook:**
The company is focused on scaling its newly implemented fulfillment capabilities while continuing to innovate and improve the entire supply chain. The strategic vision includes ensuring rapid delivery (within two days for most items across the U.S.) and leveraging the new Perth Amboy facility to improve logistics and support the high demands of small format stores.
