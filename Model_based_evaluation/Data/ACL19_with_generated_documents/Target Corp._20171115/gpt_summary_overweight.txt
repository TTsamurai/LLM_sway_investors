Based on the earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that Target is making significant investments in expanding and improving their fulfillment capabilities. The company is focusing on offering new and reliable fulfillment options for their guests, such as in-store pickup, Drive Up service, same-day delivery, next-day delivery, and ship-from-store capability. Most of these new fulfillment options have been rapidly ramping up and are showing positive results, with guests responding enthusiastically to the services.

The company's stores are fulfilling more than half of their total digital volume through in-store pickup and ship-from-store capabilities, with plans to increase this to well above 80% leading up to Christmas. The newly launched Target Restock service is also showing rapid growth, with an average order value 50% larger than an average store transaction, and high satisfaction rates from guests.

In addition, the company is investing in remodeling existing stores and expanding their small format stores to reach new densely populated neighborhoods. There is also a focus on investing in the team, training, and wages to provide exceptional service to guests, as well as rolling out new brands in stores in the third quarter.

The company is also working on improving their supply chain speed, accuracy, and reliability to achieve their goal of reliably delivering any item in their network to all but the most remote areas in the U.S. in two days or less, with most items delivered in one day. They have added a new flow center in New Jersey to help achieve this goal and are constantly iterating and improving their processes to scale up their new fulfillment capabilities.

In terms of profitability, the company sees in-store pickup and Drive Up options as highly efficient and profitable, with high guest satisfaction scores and large basket sizes for delivery transactions. While same-day delivery is more expensive, the company has seen positive reception from guests and is working on reducing costs while improving speed to make it a great economic transaction for Target.

In conclusion, the company's focus on improving and expanding their fulfillment capabilities, investing in store remodeling and team training, and striving to improve their supply chain speed and reliability indicates a positive outlook for future growth and profitability. As a financial analyst, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Target based on their strong focus on enhancing their operations and delivery capabilities.
