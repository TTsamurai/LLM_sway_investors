Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, Nektar has had a successful 2016 and has made significant progress in advancing multiple pipeline programs, especially in the areas of immuno-oncology, immunology, and chronic pain. The company's wholly owned R&D pipeline includes innovative approaches for the treatment of autoimmune disease, chronic pain, and cancer.

Some key insights and financial metrics from the transcript include:
- Nektar's partner portfolio includes products like MOVANTIK, ADYNOVATE, ONZEALD, Cipro DPI, and Amikacin Inhale, which are expected to generate future royalties and milestones.
- MOVANTIK has shown substantial growth with a peak annual run rate of over $160 million in the US.
- The company is on track to report top-line results from the Phase 3 efficacy trial of NKTR-181 in chronic pain patients.
- Nektar is also developing a broad portfolio in immuno-oncology, with promising candidates like NKTR-214, NKTR-255, and NKTR-262, which are expected to enter clinical trials in the near future. Potential positive data from these trials could significantly impact the company's future outlook.

Based on this information, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for Nektar. While the company has a strong pipeline and potential for growth, there are several key milestone events that have yet to take place, such as the results from the Phase 3 trials and the potential conditional approval for ONZEALD in Europe. These events carry significant risk and uncertainty, and the outcome could impact the company's future financial performance. Therefore, it is prudent to approach Nektar with caution and carefully monitor its progress before making any significant investment decisions.
