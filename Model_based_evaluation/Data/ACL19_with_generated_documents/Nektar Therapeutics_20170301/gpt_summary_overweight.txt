Based on the information provided in the conference call transcript, Nektar had a successful 2016 and is set for excellent growth in 2017. The company's focus on immuno-oncology and immunology pipeline is driving their progress. Key financial metrics include:

1. Advancement of multiple Nektar pipeline programs including an emerging immuno-oncology and immunology portfolio.

2. Collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb to evaluate the combination of NKTR-214 and Opdivo in various tumor types and indications, positioning NKTR-214 as a keystone therapeutic in immuno-oncology.

3. Development of other IO candidates such as NKTR-262 and NKTR-255.

4. Wholly owned R&D pipeline including NKTR-358 for autoimmune disease and NKTR-181 for chronic pain, with top line results from the Phase 3 efficacy trial of NKTR-181 in chronic pain patients expected later this month.

5. Impressive sales growth of MOVANTIK, with annual prescriptions growing by 270% and peak weekly prescriptions increasing by over 75% from 2015 to 2016.

6. Potential conditional marketing approval for ONZEALD in Europe and completion of Phase 3 programs for Cipro DPI and Amikacin Inhale with Bayer.

7. Plans to out-license NKTR-181 and seek a co-development and co-marketing partnership for NKTR-358.

8. Entry into the clinic of NKTR-262 and initiation of the first-in-human trial of NKTR-358.

With these key developments, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight'  investment stance on Nektar as the company's pipeline and collaborations position it well for growth in 2017. The focus on immuno-oncology and immunology, along with the positive financial outlook for existing products, makes Nektar an attractive investment opportunity.
