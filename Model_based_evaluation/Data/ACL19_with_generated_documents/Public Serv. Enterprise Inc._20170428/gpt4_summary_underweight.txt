   - **PSE&G:**
     - Reported net income for Q1 2017: $0.59 per share (increase from $0.52 per share in Q1 2016)

**4. Risk Factors:**
   - Regulatory risks especially relating to return on new and existing energy efficiency programs.
   - Decreasing energy prices and market volatility could compress margins further in Power segment.
   - Dependency on weather conditions which adds variability to performance outcomes.
   - Litigation and regulatory compliance risks particularly surrounding the business operations of PSEG Power and ongoing investigations.

**5. Forward Looking Statements:**
   - Non-GAAP operating earnings forecast for 2017: $2.80 to $3 per share.
   - Continued reliance on regulatory mechanisms for revenue stability, particularly evident in Energy Strong and Gas System Modernization initiatives.

**Investment Stance - Underweight:**
Given the substantial risks from the early retirement of assets requiring significant pre-tax charges, dependence on regulatory outcomes, and moderate quarterly performance with slight increases in earnings, potential investors might consider an underweight position in PSEG. The projected improvements in operational efficiency and capital investments require close monitoring to ensure they translate into sufficient earnings growth. Further, market conditions influencing the power segment, significant capital requirements, and regulatory dependencies suggest caution.
