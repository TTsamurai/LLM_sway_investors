Based on the insights and financial metrics mentioned in the conference call transcript, the company's financial performance seems to be steady, with PSE&G reporting improved net income for the first quarter of 2017 due to growth initiatives in transmission and control of operating expenses. However, the decline in the average price received on energy hedges impacted Power's non-GAAP operating earnings, leading to to the underperformance in earnings compared to the first quarter of 2016. While Power has hedged a significant portion of its forecasted production for 2017, the lower average hedge price on energy for 2017 is a concern, affecting the outlook for future earnings.

From a financial analyst's perspective, the underperformance in earnings and the uncertainty surrounding energy pricing and hedge prices are key factors behind the 'underweight' investment stance. The company's reliance on the forecasted production, the decrease in spark spreads, and the liquidity issues facing NRG REMA also raise concerns about the long-term outlook for the company's financial performance. Additionally, the ongoing FERC investigation and the impact of weather volatility on electric and gas sales add to the uncertainty.

In conclusion, based on the conference call transcript and financial insights, it is advisable for investors to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company due to the risks and uncertainties impacting its financial performance and outlook.
