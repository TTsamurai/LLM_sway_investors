. Thank you for providing the detailed summary of the recent earnings conference call transcript. Based on the information provided, the financial metrics of PSEG indicate positive growth and performance, supporting an 'overweight' investment stance. Here are the key financial metrics to consider:

PSE&G reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the first quarter of 2017 of $0.92 per share, compared to $0.91 per share in the same period of 2016. This demonstrates consistent and stable earnings growth.

PSE&G's net income for the first quarter of 2017 was $0.59 per share, a significant increase from $0.52 per share in the first quarter of 2016. This reflects successful execution of growth initiatives and control of operating expenses.

PSE&G implemented a $121 million increase in transmission revenue, and its investment in transmission is expected to reach approximately $7.6 billion of rate base by the end of 2017, representing 45% of the company's consolidated rate base. This indicates a strong and growing revenue stream.

PSE&G's investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure is forecasted to reach $3.4 billion in 2017, demonstrating a commitment to growth and expansion.

PSEG Power reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the first quarter of $0.30 per share, with adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA of $359 million. While this represents a decrease from the first quarter of 2016, the company's forecast for non-GAAP operating earnings for 2017 is $435 million to $510 million, and adjusted EBITDA of $1,080 million to $1,210 million for the full year, indicating a positive outlook for future performance.

Enterprise and Other reported a net loss for the first quarter of 2017, but non-GAAP operating earnings were unchanged quarter-over-quarter from the first quarter of 2016, indicating stability in this segment of the business.

PSE&G closed the quarter with $193 million of cash on the balance sheet, with debt representing 47% of the consolidated capital. This strong financial position provides stability and flexibility for future investments.

PSEG Power and PSE&G extended the expiration dates on $4 billion of credit facilities to March of 2022, with total available credit capacity of $3.6 billion, demonstrating strong financial liquidity.

Based on these key financial metrics, a recommendation to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for PSEG is supported. The company's stable earnings growth, strong revenue streams, and financial stability provide a positive outlook for future performance.
