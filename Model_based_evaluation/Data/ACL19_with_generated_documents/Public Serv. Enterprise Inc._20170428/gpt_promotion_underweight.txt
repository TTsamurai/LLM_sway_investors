 and it could drag into next year. Yeah, it's a great question. And when you look at it, we are trying to balance the need to capitalize on opportunities that we see in transmission and distribution and balance that with maintaining the appropriate level of leverage and being mindful of our credit metrics that we're looking to stay within. And I have to say, the regulated nature of our business provides for a very stable income profile, which is very supportive of our strong credit metrics and our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial policies. And then when you look at the opportunities that are out there to grow investments in transmission, in distribution, and some of the other opportunities that we see, we feel very well positioned to be able to fund those investments with the strong balance sheet that we have and demonstrate the ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial policy as we implement those as well. So, when you look at the financially prudent balance of those things, we're very confident in our ability to handle that and maintain our strong credit metrics as we grow the business going forward. Thank you, everyone, for your questions and your participation this morning. We appreciate your interest in PSEG and look forward to discussing our progress with you again in 90 days. Thank you and have a great day.
