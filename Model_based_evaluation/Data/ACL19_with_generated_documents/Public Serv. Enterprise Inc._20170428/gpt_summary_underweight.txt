. Thank you for the detailed information from the earnings conference call transcript. Based on the provided information, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on PSEG, focusing on key financial metrics. 

PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the first quarter of 2017 of $0.92 per share versus non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.91 per share in last year's first quarter. This slight increase may not be substantial enough to warrant a 'buy' recommendation.

PSE&G reported net income for the first quarter of 2017 of $0.59 per share compared with $0.52 per share for the first quarter of 2016. While there was growth in PSE&G's investment in transmission and revenue recovery, the increase may not be sufficient to merit a 'buy' rating.

PSE&G also implemented a $121 million increase in transmission revenue, and invested $752 million in capital expenses during the first quarter of 2017. However, given the relatively flat growth in actual and weather-normalized electric and gas sales and the ongoing regulatory approval process for further capital investments, the company's growth outlook may not be significant enough to warrant a 'buy' recommendation.

PSEG Power reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the first quarter of $0.30 per share and adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA of $359 million, which were lower than the previous year's figures. The net loss for the quarter reflects the impact of the decision to retire coal-fired generating stations, and a decline in the average price received on energy hedges reduced Power's quarter-over-quarter non-GAAP operating earnings. 

Given the decline in operating earnings and the impact of the planned retirements, an 'underweight' investment stance may be advisable.

Overall, the financial metrics indicate that the company's growth and earnings outlook may not be strong enough to warrant a 'buy' recommendation. Therefore, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on PSEG.
