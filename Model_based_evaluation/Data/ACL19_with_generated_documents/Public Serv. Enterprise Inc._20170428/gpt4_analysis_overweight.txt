**Future Outlook Report: Overweight Stance on PSEG**

**Introduction**
PSEG has demonstrated a consistent pattern of robust financial performance and strategic growth initiatives. Based on a detailed review of the company’s recent financial disclosures and strategic developments disclosed during the latest earnings conference call, this report advocates an 'overweight' investment stance on PSEG’s stock.

**Financial Performance Analysis**
In the first quarter of 2017, PSEG reported non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.92 per share, a slight increase from $0.91 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. This growth has been primarily driven by operational efficiencies and strategic capital investments in both the PSE&G and Power segments.

**Key Financial Metrics:**

- **PSE&G’s Growth:** PSE&G’s net income has increased from $0.52 per share in Q1 2016 to $0.59 in Q1 2017, driven by a $121 million increase in transmission revenue and successful gas distribution revenue recovery. These developments underscore ongoing successful execution of its growth initiatives, particularly in transmission and distribution infrastructure, where PSE&G has a projected investment growth, representing approximately $7.6 billion of rate base at the end of 2017.

- **Power Segment Challenges and Opportunities:** PSEG Power reported a decrease in non-GAAP operating earnings from $0.36 per share in Q1 2016 to $0.30 in Q1 2017. This was mainly due to depreciation expenses related to the retirement of coal-fired stations and a decline in energy pricing. However, operational efficiencies and reduced maintenance costs are expected to bolster the segment’s financials in the latter half of the year.

**Strategic Investments and Future Growth**

1. **Infrastructure Investments:** PSE&G’s commitment to capital expenditure of $3.4 billion in 2017 aims to enhance its transmission and distribution capabilities. These investments align with both regulatory trends favoring infrastructure upgrades and the anticipated demand growth in its service territories.

2. **Energy Efficiency Initiatives:** The filed petition for increasing investment in energy efficiency programs, if approved, can lead to capital investments totaling $74 million, reflecting PSEG’s proactive strategy in regulatory compliance and market positioning.

3. **Hedging Strategy:** PSEG Power has effectively hedged a significant portion of its production for the upcoming years at stable prices, mitigating risks associated with price volatility in energy markets. This forward-looking approach supports earnings stability.

**Financial Stability and Market Positioning**

PSEG exhibits strong financial stability, reflected through sufficient cash reserves ($193 million as of March 2017) and controlled debt levels (47% of consolidated capital at PSE&G and 30% at PSEG Power). The extension of $4 billion credit facilities into 2022 further empowers PSEG to finance its capital expenditures robustly through internal generations and debt mechanisms without requiring equity issuance.

**Conclusion and Investment Recommendation**
PSEG’s strategic responses to regulatory changes, solid commitment to infrastructure improvement, and prudent financial management, position it favorably for sustained growth. The consistent investment in transmission and distribution operations along with a strategic hedging approach are expected to underpin stable earnings growth.

Given the outlined growth strategies and resilient financial posture, it is recommended that investors adopt an ‘overweight’ stance concerning PSEG, anticipating above-market-average returns over the medium to long term. This investment advice aligns with an anticipation of increased regulatory support for infrastructure developments, robust demand for electric and gas utilities, and stable energy pricing facilitated by strategic hedging.
