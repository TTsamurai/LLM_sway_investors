. Thank you for your time today. Based on the detailed presentation in the recent earnings call by PSEG, I am recommending an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company's non-GAAP operating earnings for the first quarter of 2017 of $0.92 per share showed a slight increase from the previous year, indicating a positive trend in earnings growth. PSE&G, a subsidiary of PSEG, reported net income for the first quarter of 2017 of $0.59 per share, reflecting the successful execution of its growth initiatives and control of operating expenses. Additionally, PSE&G's investment in transmission is expected to grow, representing approximately 45% of the company's consolidated rate base. Revenue recovery of investments made under various programs and a reduction in O&M expenses contributed to improved net income comparisons. The company is also seeking approval to increase its investment in energy efficiency programs, which would represent a capital investment of $74 million. With a strong forecast for PSEG net income for 2017 and the company's ability to maintain strong cash flow, PSEG is in a favorable position to finance its investment programs without the need for equity issuance.

PSEG Power reported non-GAAP operating earnings for the first quarter of $0.30 per share and adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA of $359 million. Despite the impact of incremental depreciation and other expenses associated with the retirement of coal-fired generating stations, the company's forecasted non-GAAP operating earnings for 2017 remain strong at $435 million to $510 million. Power's access to low-cost shale gas provides a benefit to its margins, and the company's hedging strategy for future production shows stability.

Overall, PSEG's diverse business segments and strong financial position make it an attractive investment opportunity. The company's comprehensive presentation of its financial performance, operational details, and future outlook in the earnings call provides confidence for an 'overweight' investment stance. PSEG's ability to navigate through various challenges, such as regulatory filings, energy pricing, and market conditions, demonstrates its resilience and potential for continued growth. As a stock promoter, I believe PSEG is well-positioned for long-term value creation and recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company.
