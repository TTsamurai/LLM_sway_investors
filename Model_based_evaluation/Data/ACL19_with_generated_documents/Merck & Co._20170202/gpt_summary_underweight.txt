 about what the future holds for us in that space. Thank you. 

Based on the earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the following reasons:

1. Global Human Health annual sales reached $35.2 billion and grew 2%, but in the fourth quarter, sales declined by 1%. This indicates a slowing growth rate and potential challenges in maintaining consistent growth.

2. The decline in sales of certain products such as REMICADE and CUBICIN, and the impact of LOEs on products like ZETIA, VYTORIN, and NASONEX, suggest potential revenue decreases in the near future.

3. While the launch of KEYTRUDA has shown strong sales and potential market expansion in oncology, there is uncertainty about the adoption of the drug in the lung cancer market, and the impact of I-O/I-O combinations on future sales is still unknown.

4. Pricing pressures on products like JANUVIA due to increased discounts and rebates, and the potential negative impact on GARDASIL sales due to the transition to a two-dose regimen, signal challenges in maintaining revenue growth for existing products.

Overall, the combination of declining sales in certain products, potential revenue losses from LOEs, and uncertainty about future market adoption of new products suggests a cautious approach to investment in this company. It is advisable to underweight the investment stance until there is clearer visibility on sustained revenue growth and market acceptance of new products.
