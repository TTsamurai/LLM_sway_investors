As a stock promoter, based on the information from the company's recent earnings call, it is important to take a cautious or skeptical stance on the company and recommend an 'underweight' investment stance. While the company reported solid results for 2016, with strong performances in oncology, vaccines, diabetes, and hospital and specialty care, there are concerns for 2017.

The company will have to contend with the significant impact in 2017 of revenue loss from the loss of U.S. exclusivity for several large brands, including ZETIA, VYTORIN, CUBICIN, and NASONEX. This will likely impact sales and revenue for the company in the coming year.

Additionally, while the company is confident about the opportunity for their important brand KEYTRUDA, there are potential challenges and uncertainties surrounding the expansion of reimbursement criteria in several large markets, the negative impact of sales in the U.S. from transitioning to a two-dose regimen for GARDASIL 9, as well as the decline in REMICADE sales and generic competition for CUBICIN in the U.S.

There are also uncertainties around the potential market expansion for KEYTRUDA in non-squamous lung cancer and the timing of its impact on sales. The company's confidence in the franchise and the potential opportunities in 2017 may not materialize as expected.

Overall, based on the cautious outlook and potential challenges highlighted in the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. This means that investors may consider reducing their exposure to the company's stock in their portfolio, as there are potential risks and uncertainties that could impact its performance in the coming year.
