**Investment Recommendation Report**

**Company**: Global Human Health (GHH)
**Date**: [Insert Date]
**Analyst**: [Insert Your Name]
**Recommendation**: Overweight

### Executive Summary:
Global Human Health (GHH) has demonstrated impressive resilience and growth in its recent 2016 earnings, underscoring its robust portfolio and strategic market positions. Key growth drivers like KEYTRUDA, JANUVIA, and its vaccine portfolio have significantly contributed to the company's performance despite challenging market dynamics and loss of exclusivity (LOEs) for some products. With continuous product launches, penetration into new markets, favorable trial outcomes, and strong strategic management, GHH is poised for sustained growth. Therefore, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance reflecting the potential for above-average market returns.

### Key Investment Highlights:

1. **Robust Product Performance**: GHH's flagship products KEYTRUDA and JANUVIA have shown remarkable performance, alongside a strong vaccine business led by GARDASIL and PNEUMOVAX. KEYTRUDA alone generated $1.4 billion in 2016, with $482 million in Q4, demonstrating strong uptake across global markets including newly approved markets in Japan. Similarly, the JANUVIA franchise reported a 12% growth in US sales in 2016.

2. **Strategic Market Expansions**: The company's effective market expansion strategies are evident with recent approvals and launches in over 60 new markets for KEYTRUDA and continuous strong performance in both the US and international markets for JANUVIA and vaccine products. This geographical diversification helps mitigate risks associated with specific markets.

3. **Pipeline Strength and Approvals**: The near-term pipeline, including upcoming PDUFA dates and ongoing trials for products like KEYTRUDA, positions GHH for continuous growth. Notably, the potential expansion of KEYTRUDA into first-line and non-squamous lung cancer treatments could significantly enhance market share and provide further revenue boosts.

4. **Strategic Initiatives and Investments**: Continued investments in high-growth areas such as oncology (KEYTRUDA), diabetes care (JANUVIA), and vaccines are likely to yield significant returns. Initiatives like consumer campaigns and strategic pricing are enhancing product penetration and customer reach.

### Financial Outlook:
GHH's financial performance has been stable with a total annual sales growth of 2% reaching $35.2 billion in 2016. Despite a slight dip in Q4 sales by 1%, the company has effectively managed market challenges through strategic focuses on growth products. With new product launches and global market expansions, the revenue trajectory is expected to remain strong.

### Risks to Consider:
While GHH is strategically positioned for growth, risks include increased competition in key therapeutic areas, potential pressures from biosimilars and generics, regulatory hurdles, and pricing pressures from healthcare reforms. However, GHH's diversified portfolio and robust pipeline adequately mitigate these risks.

### Conclusion:
Given Global Human Health’s strong financial performance, strategic product launches, solid pipeline, and effective market penetration strategies, we are confident in the company’s ability to deliver superior returns. The ongoing success of KEYTRUDA and other major franchises further solidifies our 'overweight' recommendation, suggesting that GHH's stock will perform better than the average of the market over the next 6 to 12 months.

### Recommendation:
**Overweight** – Increased portfolio weighting advised.
