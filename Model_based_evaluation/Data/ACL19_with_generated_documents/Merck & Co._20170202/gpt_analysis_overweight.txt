 about how KEYTRUDA can be used in combination with other drugs. Overall, I am very optimistic about the future outlook for Global Human Health. With strong performance in oncology, primary care, vaccines, and hospital and specialty care, the company has delivered solid results in 2016 and has a clear strategy for growth in 2017 and beyond. Specifically, the continued success of the KEYTRUDA brand in various cancer treatments, the growth of the JANUVIA franchise, and the positive outlook for vaccines and specialty care products all indicate opportunities for strong financial performance in the coming years. Additionally, the ongoing clinical trials and potential label expansions for KEYTRUDA in lung cancer treatment provide further upside potential for the company. Taking into consideration the company's recent earnings conference call transcript, I adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for the company, indicating a positive outlook for its future performance.
