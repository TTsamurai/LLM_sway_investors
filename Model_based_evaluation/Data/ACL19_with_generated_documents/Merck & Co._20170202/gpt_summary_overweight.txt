Recommended Investment Stance: Overweight

Based on the strong sales performance in key franchises such as KEYTRUDA, JANUVIA, and vaccines, as well as the potential for continued growth in the oncology and diabetes segments, we recommend taking an overweight investment stance in the company. Despite the impact of LOEs in 2017, the company's commitment to building a leadership position for KEYTRUDA and maximizing product launches such as ZEPATIER and BRIDION position them well for future growth. The overall solid results in 2016 and the growth potential in 2017 and beyond make the company an attractive investment opportunity.
