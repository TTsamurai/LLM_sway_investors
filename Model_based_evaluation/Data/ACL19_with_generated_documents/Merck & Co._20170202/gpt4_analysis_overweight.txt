### Investment Thesis: Overweight

#### KEYTRUDA: A Cornerstone for Future Growth
- **Market Expansion and Approvals**: The market expansion and subsequent approvals in first-line and second-line lung, as well as melanoma across various geographies including Japan, are expected to substantially boost sales.
- **Leadership in Oncology**: The investment in promotional activities and clinical trials is likely to consolidate our market leadership, particularly in lung cancers.
- **Upcoming PDUFA Dates**: Three PDUFA dates in the first half of 2017 set the stage for potential product label expansions and enhanced market reach.

#### JANUVIA: Strong Performance with Growth Potential
- **Consistent Growth**: JANUVIA has exhibited consistent growth over quarters, particularly in the US, driven by effective managed care strategies and underlying market demand.
- **Opportunities for Expansion**: Despite competitive pressures, the drug's performance supports optimism for sustained growth, especially within the international markets.

#### Vaccines: Robust and Expanding Portfolio
- **High Growth Trajectory**: Vaccines like GARDASIL and PNEUMOVAX have shown strong performance with a promising increase in revenues through strategic transitions to advanced formulations and expanded regimens.
- **Strategic Integration**: With the full integration of vaccine operations post the termination of the European joint venture, increased operational control stands to boost profitability and market response.

#### Specialty and Hospital Care: Sustained Contributions

- **Navigating Patent Cliffs**: Strategy is underway to mitigate impacts from upcoming generic competition, emphasizing on maximizing launches and leveraging existing product lines.

### Financial Stability and Outlook

- **Strategic Investments**: Continued investments in marketing, R&D for pipeline products, and expansion into new markets are indicators of a commitment towards long-term growth.

### Risks
- **Regulatory and Competitive Risks**: Upcoming approvals, market competition, and regulatory policies present constant risks.
- **Patent Expirations**: Revenue threats from patent expirations are significant but are being actively mitigated through new product launches and focus on growth areas.
