In the company's recent earnings conference call, the speaker highlighted a few key points that are important for our analysis. The Global Human Health segment of the company achieved annual sales of $35.2 billion, with sales growth of 2%. However, sales in the fourth quarter declined by 1%, despite offsetting the impact from LOEs with growth products such as KEYTRUDA and ZEPATIER. The company also saw strong performance in its oncology franchise, with significant sales and market penetration in melanoma and head and neck cancer, as well as a new approval for first-line lung cancer. The JANUVIA franchise also showed growth, driven by strong performance in the U.S.

The vaccine business saw growth in sales, primarily driven by PNEUMOVAX and GARDASIL, with expectations for a rapid transition to a new two-dose regimen in 2017. In the hospital and specialty care segment, sales grew for the full year, but declined in the fourth quarter due to the continued decline in REMICADE and generic competition for CUBICIN in the U.S. However, there were positive contributions from new products like BRIDION and ZEPATIER.

Looking ahead, the company faces the significant impact in 2017 of revenue loss from the loss of U.S. exclusivity for several large brands. However, they remain committed to building their leadership position for KEYTRUDA globally, as well as prioritizing resources behind key franchises like JANUVIA and vaccines, and maximizing other product launches such as ZEPATIER and BRIDION.

Based on this analysis, we adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company due to the declining fourth-quarter sales, the potential impact of revenue loss from exclusivity loss for several large brands in 2017, and the need for further progress and uptake in new product launches to offset these challenges. Additionally, the company's commitment to building a leadership position for KEYTRUDA and prioritizing key franchises may require significant resource allocation, which may not result in substantial growth in the short term. Therefore, we recommend a cautious approach to investment in the company at this time.
