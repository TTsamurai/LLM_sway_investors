Based on the recent earnings call, the company's sales mix by finance channel has shown modest decreases in net penetration, as well as a reduction in the volume of customer applications in the Tier 2 space. The decline in conversion of applications in the Tier 2 space may have a negative impact on sales. Additionally, there has been some weakness from one of the company's lenders in the Tier 2 space, which could further impact sales. The company also mentioned a modest uptick in the performance of subprime lenders, but the sustainability of this improvement is uncertain.

Moreover, the company reported an increase in CAF income driven by growth in average managed receivables, but a slight compression in the portfolio interest margin. The ending allowance for loan losses was up slightly from the previous year, and the company expects a one-time unfavorable impact on its tax provision due to the revaluation of deferred tax assets based on the new tax rate. Additionally, the company noted that the volume of applications in the Tier 2 space has been more flattish, and the conversion in Tier 2 is down a little bit, possibly due to the impact of a specific lender.

Overall, the company's recent earnings call suggests potential challenges in the sales mix by finance channel, particularly in the Tier 2 space due to lender weakness and lower conversion rates. The compression in the portfolio interest margin and the potential unfavorable impact on the tax provision also raise concerns. This cautious perspective on the company's performance may warrant an 'underweight' investment stance.
