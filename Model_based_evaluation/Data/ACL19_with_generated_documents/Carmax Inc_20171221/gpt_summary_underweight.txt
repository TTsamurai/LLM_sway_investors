Based on the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for CarMax. This recommendation is based on key financial metrics that indicate potential weaknesses in key areas of the business.

Sales Mix: The sales mix by finance channel indicates a decrease in CAF net penetration and Tier 2 sales, and growth in Tier 3 sales from third parties. This suggests a potential shift in customer preferences and could impact the overall sales performance.

CAF Net Loans Originated: While there was a year-over-year increase in net loans originated, the lower penetration and a slight compression in the portfolio interest margin indicate potential challenges in loan growth and profitability.

CAF Income: The 15% increase in CAF income was mainly driven by growth in average managed receivables and a lower loss provision. However, the slight compression in the portfolio interest margin raises concerns about long-term profitability.

Tax Reform Impact: The anticipated impact of tax reform is expected to result in a one-time unfavorable impact on the tax provision, which could affect the company's financial results and cash flow in future periods.

Credit Applications and Subprime Lenders: While there has been growth in credit applications at both the high and low ends, there is uncertainty about the performance of subprime lenders. The modest uptick in the performance of subprime lenders raises concerns about potential risks in the subprime segment.

It is important to closely monitor the performance of the company, particularly in the areas of loan growth, profitability, and the impact of tax reform. It is also advisable to assess the potential risks and challenges associated with the changing sales mix and the performance of subprime lenders. Overall, based on the provided information, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended until there is more certainty and positive developments in these key financial metrics.
