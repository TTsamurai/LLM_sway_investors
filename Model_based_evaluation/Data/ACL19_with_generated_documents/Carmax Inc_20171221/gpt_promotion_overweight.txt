Based on the recent earnings call transcripts, I would recommend an overweight investment stance on CarMax Inc. The company's net loans originated in the quarter rose by 8.6% year-over-year to $1.5 billion, indicating strong sales growth and an increase in the average amount financed. Additionally, the CAF income increased by 15%, driven by a growth in average managed receivables and a lower loss provision, despite a slight compression in the portfolio interest margin. The company also experienced a reduction in its effective tax rate, which is expected to positively impact its financial results and cash flow in future periods as a result of the new federal tax law. Furthermore, the volume of customer applications at the lowest and highest ends has been strong, indicating potential growth in the company's subprime business. Although the Tier 2 lending space has seen some weakness, Tier 3 has experienced an increase in performance, potentially offsetting the impact on sales. Overall, the performance of CarMax Inc. in the current quarter has been positive, and with the anticipated benefits of the new tax law, the company's financial outlook looks favorable for future periods.
