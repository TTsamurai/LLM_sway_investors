To Whom It May Concern,

In the recent earnings conference call transcripts, Walgreens Boots Alliance reported strong business performance in the year. While the GAAP numbers were impacted by Rite Aid-related costs, the adjusted profit and cash flow were strong. The company announced a $5 billion share repurchase program and completed $3.8 billion of share repurchases in the quarter. An additional $1 billion was added to the program, along with routine anti-dilutive share repurchases.

In the fourth quarter, sales were $30.1 billion, up 5.3% versus the comparable quarter. Adjusted operating income was $1.9 billion, up 21.2%. Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance were $1.4 billion, up 18.8%. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $1.31, up 22.4%. The adjusted effective tax rate, excluding equity income from AmerisourceBergen, was 24.6%.

Retail Pharmacy USA saw sales of $22.3 billion, up 7.5% over the year-ago quarter, with adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion, up 27.5%. U.S. pharmacy total sales were up 12.6%, with a reported market share of retail prescriptions at 20.5%. Retail Pharmacy International had sales of $2.9 billion, down 0.4% in constant currency, with adjusted operating income of $261 million, an increase of 8.9%. Pharmaceutical Wholesale division saw sales of $5.4 billion, up 5.4% in constant currency, and adjusted operating income of $221 million, up 11.5%.

For fiscal 2017, the adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 11.1% to $5.10, up 12.9% in constant currency. Operating cash flow was $7.3 billion, and free cash flow was $5.9 billion. The company made early repayments of $2.6 billion of debt and expects to realize synergies of over $300 million per annum from the Rite Aid acquisition.

For fiscal 2018, the company expects adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $5.40 to $5.70. The recent hurricanes have been challenging and could adversely impact adjusted earnings per share by a few cents in the first quarter. The company also expects to grow its Med Part D business year-over-year.

Overall, Walgreens Boots Alliance is focused on driving working capital efficiency, improving its core customer proposition, and delivering impressive cash flow. The company is confident in its ability to continue to grow and manage costs effectively.

Sincerely,
