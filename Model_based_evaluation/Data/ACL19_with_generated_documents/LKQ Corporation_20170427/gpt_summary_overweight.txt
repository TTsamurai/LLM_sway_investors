Based on this summary of financial metrics, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended due to the positive growth in revenue, improvement in gross margins, strong EBITDA and operating income growth, higher EPS, and the company's guidance for strong performance in 2017. Additionally, the company's debt level and net debt to EBITDA ratio are also favorable for an 'overweight' investment stance.
