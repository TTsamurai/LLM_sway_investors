Based on the recent earnings call, Aetna has reported solid operating earnings of $2.9 billion in 2016, representing a 7% increase over 2015. Their operating earnings per share stood at $8.23. The company showed steady top-line growth, with operating revenue reaching $63 billion, a 5% increase from 2015. Aetna's operating margin was 8.3%, surpassing their target operating margin range. Their Total Health Care Medical Benefit Ratio was 81.8%, showing improvement over previous projections. Additionally, their operating expense ratio improved by 80 basis points over the previous year.

The company experienced strong cash flows in their Health Care and Group Insurance segments, with operating cash flows totaling 1.4 times operating earnings and 1.8 times GAAP net income. They are confident in the adequacy of their reserves and ended the year with approximately $2.2 billion of cash at the parent.

Looking forward to 2017, Aetna has provided an initial standalone 2017 operating EPS projection of at least $8.55, representing at least 10% growth over their 2016 baseline view. They anticipate membership growth in Medicare and strong revenue growth in their Government business, offsetting projected declines in Individual and Small Group Commercial Insured membership. The company also foresees a slight uptick in medical cost trend and an increase in the Total Health Care Medical Benefit Ratio, driven by the suspension of the health insurer fee.

The company remains confident in their ability to achieve their 2017 operating EPS projection and is actively working on strategies to stabilize the retail market in healthcare, potentially accelerating growth in this sector. Despite expected losses in their Individual ACA-compliant products, Aetna's fundamentals remain strong, with solid growth opportunities in Medicare and Medicaid.

With their strong performance in 2016 and a positive outlook for 2017, Aetna presents an attractive investment opportunity, warranting an 'overweight' investment stance. The company's ability to navigate through challenges and maintain a solid financial position supports a compelling promotion for potential investors.
