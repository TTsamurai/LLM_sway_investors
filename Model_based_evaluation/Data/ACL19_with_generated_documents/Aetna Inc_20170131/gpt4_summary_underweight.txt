- Anticipated recovery strategies include reduced losses on Individual products, resumption of share repurchase activity, and growth in Medicare.

### Conclusion:
Despite a strong overall performance in 2016, significant concerns remain, particularly with ACA-compliant products causing sustained losses. The projected decline in some membership segments and anticipated challenges in 2017 suggest caution. An 'underweight' investment stance is recommended for Aetna given the financial metrics, potential volatility in the ACA segment, and uncertain growth prospects in key insurance markets. Further monitoring of membership trends and profit margins is advised to reassess the stance as new developments occur.
