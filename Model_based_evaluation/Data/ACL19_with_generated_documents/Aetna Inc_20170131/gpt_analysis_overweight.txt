Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is clear that Aetna has had a strong performance in 2016, with growth in operating earnings and operating revenue. The company's operating results have been supported by solid top line growth and operating margins, and are consistent with the long-term growth framework. The company's full-year 2016 operating earnings were $2.9 billion, a 7% increase over 2015, with operating earnings per share of $8.23.

Key financial metrics such as Total Health Care Medical Benefit Ratio, adjusted operating expense ratio, and pre-tax operating margin have all shown improvements, reflecting the company's disciplined focus on managing operating costs while growing the top line. The company's operating cash flows remain strong, and it has a very strong financial position, capital structure, and liquidity.

Looking ahead to 2017, Aetna has provided an initial standalone 2017 operating EPS projection of at least $8.55, representing at least 10% growth over the 2016 baseline view. The company expects continued growth in Commercial Insured operating earnings, led by a reduced level of losses on Individual products and the resumption of share repurchase activity. There are also growth opportunities in Medicare and Medicaid, which are projected to be strong markets for Aetna.

The outlook for 2017 includes projected impacts on membership, operating revenue, non-ACA Core Commercial medical cost trend, Total Health Care Medical Benefit Ratio, and adjusted operating expense ratio. Aetna also expects to have excess cash at the parent of approximately $4 billion after funding all transaction-related fees and expenses.

In conclusion, based on the company's strong financial performance, growth opportunities in key markets, and positive outlook for 2017, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for Aetna. Aetna's strong financial position, consistent growth framework, and strong performance in key business segments provide a solid foundation for future growth and investment potential.
