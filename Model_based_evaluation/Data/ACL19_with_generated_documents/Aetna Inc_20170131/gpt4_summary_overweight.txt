The operating EPS growth aligns well with our positive outlook on the company.

- **Revenue and Membership Growth:**

This was fueled by high healthcare premium yields and growth in membership, notably in the Government business and Large Group Commercial Insured products. Despite seeing attrition in some areas like Small Group and International Commercial Insured products, the overall growth is a positive signal for potential investors.

  Aetna reported a full-year pre-tax operating margin of 8.3% and an improved Total Health Care Medical Benefit Ratio of 81.8%, exceeding the prior year's projections and showcasing effective expense management. The adjusted operating expense ratio also saw a significant improvement to 18.1%, 80 basis points better than the previous year.

Cash and investments at the parent level remained solid at approximately $2.2 billion after dividends and other expenditures.

- **Guidance and Future Outlook:**
  For 2017, Aetna provided an initial standalone operating EPS projection of at least $8.55, representing at least a 10% increase over 2016’s adjusted EPS. This projection is based on growth in Commercial Insured operating earnings, propelled by reduced losses on Individual products and continued strong growth in Medicare services.

**Investment Stance:**

Given Aetna’s strong performance in 2016 and the positive outlook for 2017, the recommendation is to adopt an ‘overweight’ stance. The company’s ability to manage costs effectively, combined with robust earnings growth and a stable capital position, supports a bullish outlook. Also, strategic movements such as the planned share repurchase bolster the confidence in Aetna’s financial health and operational strategy moving forward.

Investors should consider the ongoing changes and strategic decisions in the healthcare landscape, such as the implications of the ACA, which might have bearing effects on future performances. Nonetheless, solid historical performance and forward-looking guidance present Aetna as a promising investment in the health insurance sector.

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Consider increasing holdings in Aetna based on current and projected financial strength.
2. Monitor ongoing regulatory changes and their impact on Aetna.
3. Continue assessing the operational execution, especially in growth sectors like Medicare and Medicaid, which are pivotal to future revenue streams.

This positions Aetna as a favorable option for those looking to capitalize on the growth and resilience in the healthcare insurance industry.
