The company's results reflect robust operational management and strategic positioning in both the government and commercial sectors. With several strategic adjustments underway and a solid balance sheet, Aetna is well-positioned to capitalize on market opportunities and address challenges head-on.

**2016 Performance Highlights:**
- **Operating Earnings:** Aetna reported a 7% increase in operating earnings from 2015, reaching $2.9 billion. 
- **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** The EPS stood strong at $8.23, noteworthy given the absence of share repurchases.
- **Revenue Growth:** Operating revenue saw a nearly 5% increase from 2015, reaching $63 billion. This growth was largely driven by higher health care premium yields and membership growth in the Government business and Large Group Commercial Insured products.
- **Operating Margin and Cost Management:** Full-year pre-tax operating margin was robust at 8.3%. The adjusted operating expense ratio improved by 80 basis points over 2015, indicating disciplined cost management.
- **Medical Benefit Ratio:** The Total Health Care Medical Benefit Ratio ended the year better than expected at 81.8%.
- **Cash Flow:** Demonstrated strong operating cash flows at 1.4 times operating earnings and 1.8 times GAAP net income.

**Operational Strengths and Strategic Moves:**
- **Government Business:** Saw substantial growth, particularly in Medicare and Medicaid enrollments, affirming Aetna’s strong positioning in these segments.
- **Commercial Segment:** Despite challenges in the ACA-compliant market, there are significant improvements and managed attritions with an overarching positive outlook due to strategic adjustments.
- **Effective Capital Allocation:** Despite holding off on share repurchases due to the pending Humana acquisition, the company effectively used capital for dividends and maintaining a robust balance sheet.

**Future Projections and Strategy:**
- **2017 EPS Guidance:** Aetna has projected an operating EPS of at least $8.55, indicating at least a 10% growth vis-à-vis the 2016 baseline adjusted EPS.
- **Membership and Revenue Outlook:** While Individual Commercial memberships are projected to decrease, this is balanced by growth in Medicare and ASC memberships. Operating revenue is expected in the range of $60 billion to $61 billion.
- **Cost Management and Margin Outlook:** The company anticipates maintaining a pre-tax operating margin around 8%. Efforts to manage the health care medical cost trend within 6% to 7% and a projected improvement in the adjusted operating expense ratio to around 16.5% underscore effective cost control measures.
- **Capital Deployment:** Plans include a cautious approach to share repurchase, optimizing timing and scale throughout the fiscal year.

**Risks:**
- **ACA Compliance:** Continued pressure from ACA-compliant product segments could affect profitability, although Aetna is undertaking measures to mitigate this risk.
- **Regulatory Changes:** Changes in health care laws and regulations could impact operations and market dynamics.
- **Pending Acquisition:** The completion and integration of Humana could present operational and financial challenges.

**Conclusion:**
Aetna’s disciplined operational management, strategic foresight, and robust financial health render it an appealing investment opportunity. With projected EPS growth, effective response to regulatory changes, and strategic capital deployment, Aetna is poised for sustained growth. Our 'overweight' stance is predicated on these strengths and the proactive approach in managing both opportunities and challenges.
