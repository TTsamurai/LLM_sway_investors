Based on the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, Aetna has reported solid operating earnings of $2.9 billion in 2016, with an increase of 7% over 2015. Operating earnings per share were reported at $8.23. The top line perspective included 23.1 million medical members and an operating revenue increase by nearly 5% to $63 billion, driven by higher health care premium yields and membership growth in Government business and Large Group Commercial Insured products. Their operating margin was 8.3%, and their Total Health Care Medical Benefit Ratio was 81.8%. Adjusted operating expense ratio improved by 80 basis points to 18.1% over 2015.

However, the focus on Individual Commercial ACA-compliant products continues to be a significant drag, with pre-tax operating losses reaching $450 million in 2016. Aetna made changes to their footprint to reduce exposure to these products in 2017, projecting significant membership declines and continued losses, albeit lower than in 2016. The Government business exhibited strong growth, and Aetna remains confident in their reserves and financial position.

In 2017, Aetna projected at least 10% growth in operating EPS, driven by growth in Commercial Insured operating earnings and growth in Medicare products. They also projected a decline in Individual Commercial membership and Medicaid membership, and decline in Small Group Commercial Insured products.

From a financial analyst perspective, there are several concerning factors highlighted in the conference call. The significant losses in Individual Commercial ACA-compliant products in 2016 and the projected continued losses in 2017, as well as declines in Small Group Commercial Insured and Medicaid memberships contribute to the negative outlook. Furthermore, the upward trend in Total Health Care Medical Benefit Ratio and projected increase in non-ACA Core Commercial medical cost trend are concerning financial metrics. All of these factors indicate potential challenges for Aetna in the upcoming year.

Considering these metrics, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for Aetna until there is more clarity on the impact of the ACA products and membership trends, as well as clearer improvement in the financial metrics such as Total Health Care Medical Benefit Ratio and medical cost trend.
