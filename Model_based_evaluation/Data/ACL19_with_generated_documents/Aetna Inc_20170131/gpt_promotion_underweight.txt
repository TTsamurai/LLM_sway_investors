Based on the company's recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on Aetna as a stock promoter. The cautious perspective is based on the significant pressure from Aetna's ACA-compliant products, which have led to pre-tax operating losses of $450 million in the Individual Commercial ACA-compliant products. Additionally, there are projected losses on the Individual Commercial ACA-compliant products for 2017, although they are expected to be lower than in 2016. The company also experienced a decline in membership in its Small Group and international Commercial Insured products and is repositioning in these areas. Furthermore, there is uncertainty in the timing and application of capital deployment, and the company's 2017 operating revenue is projected to be lower due to the net impact of previously disclosed Medicaid contract losses and the suspension of the health insurer fee. Overall, the company faces challenges in 2017, including projected losses in certain business segments and revenue headwinds, which support the 'underweight' investment stance recommendation.
