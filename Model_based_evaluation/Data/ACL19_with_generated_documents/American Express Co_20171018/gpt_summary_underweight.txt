 a continued focus on prudently managing expenses to support revenue growth.

In terms of shareholder returns, we have been successful in returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends, and we will continue to prioritize this while maintaining strong capital ratios. 

Despite the strong financial performance, we are cautious about the impact of evolving regulations in Europe and Australia on our network business, and the intense competition in the U.S. consumer space. While we have some headwinds, we are excited about growth opportunities in areas such as SME and international consumer, reflecting the diversity of our business model.

While there are challenges, we remain focused on delivering steady and consistent earnings growth. We are also mindful of the long-term benefits of investing in growth opportunities, and we will continue to selectively reinvest into areas of the business that we believe will drive continued revenue growth in the medium to long term.

Overall, we remain confident in the strength of our business model and the opportunities for growth across our diverse customer segments and geographies. However, given the current challenges, we are adopting an 'underweight' investment stance with a cautious approach towards future growth. 

This stance is informed by the potential impact of ongoing expenses, evolving regulations, and intense competition on our business. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and adapt our investment strategy as needed.
