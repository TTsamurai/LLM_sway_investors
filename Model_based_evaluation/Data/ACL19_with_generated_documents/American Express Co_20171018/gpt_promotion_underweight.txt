. So we feel good about all the diverse sources of growth across our business segments and geographies. Although we have some headwinds from regulation in markets around the world and intense competition in the U.S. we are particularly excited about the opportunities we have in high growth areas like SME and international consumer which reflect the diversity of our business model. Overall, we feel good about the steady performance across the different customer segments we serve and the different geographies in which we operate. Looking at the metrics summary, we have made solid progress on our cost reduction initiatives and we remain confident that we will remove $1 billion from the company's cost base on a run rate basis by the end of 2017. We are focused on delivering steady and consistent earnings growth, building upon the range of growth opportunities that we see across our diverse customer segments and geographies. With that, we are increasing our full year earnings per share guidance to a range of $5.80 to $5.90. And we are pleased to be able to both raise our earnings expectations while also funding some incremental investments aimed at driving moderate to long term results. Thank you.  Do you have any questions for us?
