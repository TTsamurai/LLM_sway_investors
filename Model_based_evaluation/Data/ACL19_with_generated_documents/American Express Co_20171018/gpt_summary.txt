 Moving to our metrics, we have seen steady revenue growth across our diverse business segments and geographies. Revenue growth for Q3 was 8% and net income grew 19%. Our earnings per share for the quarter was $1.50, up 25% from the third quarter of 2016. We have also had an unusually low tax rate of roughly 26% this quarter, driven primarily by the realization of certain foreign tax credits and an ongoing shift in the geographic mix of our earnings. Despite this, the net impact to earnings per share is minimal and reflects the underlying core performance of the business. Our return on equity for the 12 months ending in September was 23%, with expectations that it will trend back towards our historical level by the end of the year.

Looking at billed business performance trends, worldwide FX adjusted Billings grew 8% in the quarter, with strong growth in both the small and midsized enterprises (SME) segment and the international consumer segment. Loan growth also accelerated to 14% on a reported basis and 13% on an FX adjusted basis, with more than 50% of new loans added to our portfolio coming from existing customers. Our credit metrics have shown an upward trend, with a worldwide lending write-off rate of 1.8% for the quarter.

On the expense side, total operating expenses were flat to the prior year, despite incurring discrete charges related to our U.S. loyalty coalition business, U.S. prepaid business, and the recent hurricanes in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico. We are making solid progress on our cost reduction initiatives, and we remain confident that we will remove $1 billion from the company's cost base on a run rate basis by the end of 2017.

In terms of capital management, we have returned 97% of the capital generated thus far in 2017 to shareholders, driving a 5% reduction in our average shares outstanding versus the prior year. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio moved down sequentially to 11.9% in line with our expectations, reflecting accelerated progress on our cost savings initiatives and our ability to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders while... (remaining strong in maintaining our strong capital ratios in accordance with the annual CCAR review).

In summary, we have a simple financial model that is driving revenue growth across our diverse business. Our steady performance across different customer segments and geographies, combined with strong revenue growth opportunities in SME and international consumer segments, reflects the diversity of our business model. We are focused on delivering consistent earnings growth and remain confident in our ability to drive moderate to long-term results. With the increase in full-year earnings per share guidance to a range of $5.80 to $5.90, we are committed to balancing financial commitments and investing for the long term. We believe in the value of our brand and customer loyalty and are working hard to drive long-term customer engagement and maximize our financial returns.
