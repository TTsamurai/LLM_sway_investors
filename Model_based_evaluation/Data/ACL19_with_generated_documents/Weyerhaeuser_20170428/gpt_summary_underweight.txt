. Our Q1 earnings call was focused on our strong financial results, especially in Timberlands and Wood Products. The company reported net earnings of $157 million or $0.21 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Excluding after-tax special items, we earned $167 million or $0.22 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $454 million, an improvement of 14% compared with the fourth quarter and 35% compared with the first quarter of 2016. Despite these strong results, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance based on the following key financial metrics:

1. Timberlands: While the Timberlands segment contributed $148 million to first quarter earnings, the Southern Timberlands saw a decline in EBITDA due to seasonally lower harvest volumes and lower average realizations. The Northern Timberlands also saw a small improvement in EBITDA compared to the fourth quarter, but fee harvest declined seasonally. The segment is heavily reliant on market conditions and international sales, which can be volatile.

2. Real Estate & Energy: The Real Estate and Energy & Natural Resources segments contributed $26 million to first quarter earnings and $43 million to adjusted EBITDA, but adjusted EBITDA declined by $47 million compared with the fourth quarter. Earnings were comparable to fourth quarter earnings before special items, but we anticipate a slow transaction activity in this segment.

3. Wood Products: Wood Products contributed $172 million to first quarter earnings, an increase of nearly 75% compared with the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA improved $75 million to $207 million. While we saw improvements in EBITDA for lumber, OSB, and engineered wood products, there is potential for oversupply and price volatility.

Overall, while the company's financial results are strong, there are potential challenges in market conditions and international sales that could affect future performance. Proceed with caution and consider an 'underweight' investment stance. Thank you.
