 as well as the Webcast of the capital management call. Thank you. Goodbye. 

Based on the information provided in the transcript of the earnings call, I would recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. While the revenue for the fourth quarter increased by 7% from a year ago, there are several factors to consider that warrant a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company. 

First, the CFO, Kevin March, is retiring later in the year, which may create uncertainty in the management of the company. Second, there is a decline in revenue for personal electronics due to a weakness in mobile phones, which is a significant portion of the company's revenue. Additionally, there was a decline in revenue for industrial and other segments. 

Furthermore, there is a cautious outlook for the future, as indicated by the CFO's statement that they expect a mid-single digit decline in the other business going forward. 

Finally, while the company has a strong focus on increasing market share in the industrial and automotive sectors, the growth in these sectors may not be enough to offset the declines in other segments. 

Overall, these factors indicate potential challenges and uncertainties for the company's future performance, leading to a recommendation for an 'underweight' investment stance.
