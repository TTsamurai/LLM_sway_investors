at ti.com/ir. We believe that TI's performance in the fourth quarter of 2016 demonstrates the ongoing strength of the business model. There are several key points to consider as we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company based on the recent earnings call:

1. Revenue growth: TI's revenue for the fourth quarter increased by 7% from a year ago, driven by strong demand in the automotive and industrial markets. The company's core businesses, Analog and Embedded Processing, both showed growth, with operating margin increasing in both.

2. Free cash flow: TI's cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, with free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period increasing by 6% from a year ago. The company's free cash flow margin was 30.5% of revenue, up from 29.6% a year ago.

3. Capital management strategy: TI has a disciplined capital management strategy and is committed to returning all of its free cash flow to shareholders. With a focus on increasing dividend growth and share repurchases, the company provides a solid framework for allocating returns to owners.

4. End-market performance: TI has strategically focused on increasing market share in the industrial and automotive sectors, which now make up 51% of the company's revenue. The company's investments in these markets have resulted in broad-based growth across regions and products.

Based on these factors, we believe that TI is well-positioned for long-term success and offers an attractive investment opportunity. We encourage investors to consider an 'overweight' stance on the company and to join the upcoming capital management call on February 8th for further insights into the company's strategy.
