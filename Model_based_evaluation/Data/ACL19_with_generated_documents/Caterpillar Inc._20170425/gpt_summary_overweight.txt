- Sales and revenues increased by 4% in the first quarter of 2017 to $9.8 billion, marking a significant improvement over the previous 10 quarters.
- Resource Industries registered the largest increase, followed by Energy & Transportation and Construction Industries.
- The sales increase was driven by higher sales volume, favorable mix, improved price, and lower costs.

Operating Profit:
- Operating profit for the first quarter was $417 million, compared to $494 million in 2016. However, excluding restructuring costs, operating profit rose by $514 million.
- Positive changes in operating profit were attributed to higher sales volume, favorable mix, improved price realization, and lower costs.
- Variable manufacturing costs, lower period costs, and strong operating cash flow contributed to the improvement in operating profit.

- Construction Industries' operating profit was favorable due to favorable price realization and lower costs, delivering the strongest operating margin percent in a long time.
- Resource Industries reported a significant sales increase of 15% and positive operating profit for the first time since the second quarter of 2015, driven by higher sales volume and lower costs.
- Energy & Transportation noted a slight sales increase in the quarter and a significant rise in operating profit, primarily attributable to higher sales volume and improved material costs.

- Profit per share outlook, excluding restructuring costs, was raised to $3.75, primarily due to an increase in sales volume and a corresponding variable margin.

Investment Stance:
Based on the positive financial metrics and strong performance across segments, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance for the company. The significant sales increase, improved operating profit, positive outlook, and focus on cost management indicate strong potential for growth and shareholder value. Additionally, the company's deliberate investments in lean, R&D, and digital initiatives demonstrate a proactive approach to driving future profitability.

In conclusion, the company's first quarter results and outlook support an 'overweight' investment stance, showcasing a solid foundation for potential financial growth and success in the coming year.
