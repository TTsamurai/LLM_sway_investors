Based on the earnings conference call transcript, the following key financial metrics were highlighted:

1. Sales and revenues increased by $400 million or about 4% in the first quarter of 2017 to $9.8 billion, marking the first time in 10 quarters that sales and revenues were higher than the prior year.

2. Restructuring costs were $752 million in the quarter, $591 million more than the first quarter of 2016, resulting in a decrease in profit per share from $0.46 to $0.32.

3. Excluding restructuring costs, profit per share doubled from $0.64 in the first quarter of 2016 to $1.28 in the first quarter of 2017, driven by higher sales, favorable mix, improved price, and lower costs.

4. Operating profit was $417 million, lower than the $494 million in 2016, attributed to increased restructuring costs. Excluding restructuring costs, operating profit increased by $514 million, driven by higher sales volume, favorable mix, improved price realization, and lower costs.

5. Construction Industries' sales and revenues were up slightly to $4.1 billion, driven by positive price realization and strong demand in China, partially offset by lower sales volume in North America.

6. Resource Industries' sales were $1.7 billion, up 15% from 2016, with an operating profit of $158 million, marking the first positive operating profit since the second quarter of 2015.

7. Energy & Transportation sales were up slightly to $3.4 billion, with operating profit increasing from $410 million to $552 million, attributable to higher sales volume and improved material costs.

8. The full-year outlook for sales and revenues was raised to a range of $38 billion to $41 billion, with a profit-per-share outlook of $2.10 due to the decision to close certain facilities. Excluding restructuring costs, the profit-per-share outlook was raised to $3.75.

In conclusion, the company had a strong first quarter with increases in sales and revenues across all primary segments. The outlook for the full year has been raised, reflecting improved market conditions, strong order activity, and an increase in the backlog; however, potential volatility in commodity prices and political uncertainty are factors to consider. Management remains focused on cost management and deliberate investments to deliver the highest shareholder value.
