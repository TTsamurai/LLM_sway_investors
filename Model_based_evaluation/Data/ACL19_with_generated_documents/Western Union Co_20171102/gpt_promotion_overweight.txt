Based on the recent earnings call, the company has shown a 2% increase in revenues compared to the prior year period, and a 3% increase on a constant-currency basis. Factors such as currency translation and mix impact have had a slight negative impact on revenue growth, but there has been strong growth in C2C transactions, especially in the westernunion.com segment. 

Regionally, North America and Europe have shown revenue increases of 1-2%, while the Middle East and Africa, and South Asia regions have experienced revenue declines. Latin America and the Caribbean, however, have shown very strong growth.

Margins and profitability have experienced a slight decline due to higher incentive compensation expense and increased marketing spend. Operating margin was 19.3%, a decline from the prior year period.

Cash flow from operating activities was $423 million year-to-date, including outflows related to settlements with federal and state governments and WU Way spending. 

The company has affirmed its outlook for the year, with GAAP revenue growth expected to be a low-single-digit increase, slightly improved from the previous outlook of flat to low-single-digit increase. Adjusted earnings per share outlook has been increased to a range of $1.75 to $1.85, and GAAP earnings per share has also been increased to a range of $1.50 to $1.60. Expected GAAP cash flow from operating activities has also been increased to approximately $600 million.

Based on these results and recent business trends, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. Despite some challenges in certain regions, there is overall positive growth and profitability, and the outlook for the year has been improved. Additionally, the company is focused on increasing its digital capabilities, which may lead to further growth in the future.
