 in our financial performance. Our adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was 20.6%, compared to 21.7% in the prior year, while our GAAP operating margin was 19.3%, down from 20.2% in the prior year. The decline in margins was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and increased marketing spend. Additionally, our EBITDA margin was 24% in the quarter, down from 25% in the prior year, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 25.3%, down from 26.5% in the prior year. The decline in margins was attributable to the same factors as operating profit margins.

On the tax front, our effective tax rate in the quarter was 1.5%, down from 9.6% in the third quarter of last year. Our adjusted tax rate was 3.6%, down from 11.7% in the prior year period. We expect our full-year tax rate to be approximately 10% to 11% for GAAP earnings per share, and 12% to 13% for adjusted earnings per share.

In terms of earnings per share, our GAAP earnings per share in the third quarter were $0.51, up from $0.44 in the prior year period, while our adjusted earnings per share were $0.53, up from $0.47 in the third quarter of last year.

Overall, we are affirming our outlook for operating margin and increasing our earnings per share and cash flow outlooks compared to our previous outlook reported on August 3. We are increasing our outlook for GAAP revenue slightly to reflect a more favorable exchange rate, while the constant currency revenue outlook has not changed. We now expect GAAP revenue growth to be a low-single-digit increase, a slight improvement from the previous outlook of flat to low-single-digit increase. Given favorable profitability trends, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $1.75 to $1.85, up from $1.70 to $1.80 previously. GAAP earnings per share have also been increased to a range of $1.50 to $1.60 compared to $1.46 to $1.56 in our previous outlook.

In conclusion, our strong business performance in the third quarter has led to solid profitability and cash flow, and we have increased our earnings per share outlook for the year. Based on this positive outlook, our financial analysis recommends an 'overweight' investment stance for potential investors.
