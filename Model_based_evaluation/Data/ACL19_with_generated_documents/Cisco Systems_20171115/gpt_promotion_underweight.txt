To Whom It May Concern,

After reviewing the recent earnings call transcript for Cisco Systems, I would like to recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. While the company did report a solid quarter with revenue of $12.1 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.61, there are some concerns that warrant a cautious or skeptical perspective.

First, while the company is seeing traction with their new intent-based networking solutions and delivering accelerated innovation across their portfolio, there may be uncertainty regarding the sustainability of this growth. The ongoing shift to a multi-cloud world and the need for comprehensive security measures also presents challenges for the company.

Additionally, while the company is investing in new technologies and partnerships, such as their collaboration with Google, the long-term impact and success of these initiatives remain to be seen.

Furthermore, the company's focus on providing more enhanced customer and employee experiences through their collaboration portfolio, including the proposed acquisition of BroadSoft, may present integration and execution risks.

In summary, while there are positive aspects of Cisco's recent performance, there are also underlying factors that warrant caution. As such, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended until further clarity is provided on the company's long-term growth prospects.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
