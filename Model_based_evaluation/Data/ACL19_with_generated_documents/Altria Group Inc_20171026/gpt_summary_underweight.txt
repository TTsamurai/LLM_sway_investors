In light of the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance. Here's a detailed summary report on key financial metrics:

1. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth: The company reported a 9.8% growth in adjusted diluted EPS in the third quarter and 5.5% for the first nine months of 2017. Although this demonstrates earnings growth, the rate of growth has slowed in the first nine months compared to the third quarter.

2. Dividend and Share Repurchase: The company returned a significant amount of cash to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchase. The board of directors voted to increase the quarterly dividend by 8.2% in August, marking the 51st increase in the past 48 years.

3. Smokeable Products Segment: In the quarter, the smokeable products segment delivered 7.7% adjusted operating company's income growth, driven by strong pricing and lower costs offsetting volume declines. However, reported cigarette volumes were challenged due to industry decline, trade inventory movements, and retail share declines.

4. Smokeless Product Segment: USSTC delivered outstanding adjusted operating company's income growth of 15.7% in the third quarter, driven by higher net pricing and lower costs. Copenhagen's retail share grew while Skoal's share declined.

5. E-Vapor: MarkTen's third quarter volume grew by more than 50%, with a national retail share of approximately 13.5% in mainstream channels.

6. Regulatory Environment: The FDA announced a comprehensive plan for U.S. tobacco and nicotine regulation. While the company supports FDA's intention to issue regulations, it acknowledges a long and complex process ahead.

7. Competition and Market Dynamics: Competitive launches and promotional spending have increased the short-term share pressure on Marlboro, the share leader. There has also been elevated competitive activity in the smokeless product segment.

Based on these key financial metrics, it is recommended to maintain an 'underweight' investment stance due to the challenging competitive landscape, slow down in earnings growth, and the long and complex regulatory process ahead. Additionally, while the company is returning cash to shareholders, the competitive activity and market dynamics pose potential risks to future performance.
