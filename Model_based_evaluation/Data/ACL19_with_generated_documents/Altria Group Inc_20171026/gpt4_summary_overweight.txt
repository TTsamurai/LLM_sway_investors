### Earnings Conference Call Summary – Altria Group, Inc.

#### Financial Performance Overview
Altria Group, Inc. demonstrated robust financial performance in the third quarter of 2017, recording a 9.8% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share and a 5.5% increase over the first nine months of the year:
- **Financial Metrics**: The company's deliberate focus on enhancing shareholder returns was evidenced by significant dividend payouts and share repurchase activities. Notably, the dividend was increased by 8.2% in August, marking the 51st increase in 48 years.
- **Core Business Performance**: The primary earnings driver was the core tobacco business, particularly the smokeable products segment, which showed a 7.7% growth in adjusted operating income for the quarter and 7.4% for the first nine months. 

#### Segment Analysis
1. **Smokeable Products**: Despite industry-wide volume declines, the segment benefited from strong pricing and cost management. However, Marlboro experienced a 0.5 share point decline in retail share to 43.2% for the quarter, influenced by external factors such as the SCT increase in California and heightened competitive activity.
   - **Strategic Adjustments**: Efforts to stabilize Marlboro's market share included reallocating marketing resources and launching Marlboro Black label in specific markets to leverage packaging innovations.
   
2. **Smokeless Products**: This segment showed a substantial income growth of 15.7% in the quarter due to higher pricing and cost efficiencies. Notably, Copenhagen’s retail share increased, indicating successful market penetration and brand investment optimization.
   - **Operational Focus**: The strategy emphasizes the growth of the Copenhagen brand while refining Skoal investments to maximize profitability.

3. **E-vapor Products**: The MarkTen brand experienced more than 50% volume growth, supported by expanded distribution. Plans to further enhance the MarkTen product line are expected to be discussed in the upcoming Investor Day.

#### Regulatory and Market Environment
The FDA's comprehensive plan on tobacco and nicotine regulation in July represents a potential strategic advantage for Altria, accommodating innovation in product development. This regulatory stance aligns with Altria's long-term advocacy for policies recognizing a continuum of risk among tobacco products.

#### Forward-Looking Statements
- **Full-Year Guidance Reaffirmed**: Altria projects a 7.5% to 9.5% growth in adjusted diluted EPS for the full year of 2017.
- **Future Prospects**: Upcoming discussions at Altria's Investor Day will further highlight plans around innovative product lines such as IQOS and address the competitive dynamics shaped by recent product launches across the industry.
