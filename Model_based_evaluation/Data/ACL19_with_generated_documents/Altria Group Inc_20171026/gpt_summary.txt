 Based on the recent earnings conference call transcripts from Altria, here are the key financial metrics to consider:

1. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth:
- Altria reported a 9.8% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share in the third quarter and 5.5% for the first nine months of 2017. Earnings growth is accelerating as the year progresses. The company has also reaffirmed its full-year guidance of 7.5% to 9.5% adjusted diluted EPS growth.

2. Revenue and Operating Income:
- The smokeable products segment delivered 7.7% adjusted operating company's income growth in the third quarter and 7.4% for the first nine months. Reported cigarette volumes were challenged due to industry decline, trade inventory movements, retail share declines, and one fewer shipping day.
- The smokeless product segment delivered outstanding adjusted operating company's income growth of 15.7% in the third quarter and 6.3% for the first nine months of 2017. Copenhagen's retail share grew 0.2% to 33.9% in the third quarter, and by 0.6% for the first nine months to 33.6%.

3. Competitive Activity and Promotional Spending:
- Altria highlighted elevated competitive activity and high levels of promotional spending in the cigarette market. There were multiple brand launches by major competitors, contributing to short-term share pressure on Marlboro, the share leader.

4. E-Vapor and Innovative Products:
- Nu Mark grew MarkTen's third-quarter volume by more than 50% and had a third-quarter national retail share of approximately 13.5% in mainstream channels. The company announced plans to expand the distribution of MarkTen Bold to approximately 15,000 additional stores in the fourth quarter. Altria is also making significant progress on the commercialization plans for IQOS, a heated tobacco product.

5. Regulatory Environment and FDA's Comprehensive Plan:
- FDA announced its comprehensive plan for U.S. tobacco and nicotine regulation, indicating a shift towards encouraging the development of innovative tobacco products that may be less risky than cigarettes. Altria expressed support for FDA's approach and its intention to issue regulations outlining what information it expects in product applications and reports to demonstrate substantial equivalence.

These key financial metrics provide insights into Altria's performance in its tobacco and innovative product segments, competitive dynamics, and its stance on regulatory developments. The company is also gearing up to share further details and plans at its upcoming Investor Day, indicating a focus on long-term growth and strategic investments in product innovation and distribution expansion.
