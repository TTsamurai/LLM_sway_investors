Based on the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, we can see that the company's financial performance in the third quarter was solid, with both GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS showing positive growth. Total company revenues grew by 4% to $31.8 billion, and consolidated gross margin dollars increased by 2% and 1% for GAAP and non-GAAP, respectively.

The Pharmaceutical segment saw a 3% revenue growth to $28.4 billion, driven by the Specialty Solutions business and growth from Pharmaceutical Distribution customers. However, segment profit for the quarter decreased by 7% to $611. This was attributed to generic pharmaceutical pricing and the loss of Safeway, among other factors. Despite this, the Pharma segment saw double-digit bottom-line growth in Specialty Solutions and China.

On the other hand, the Medical segment experienced robust revenue growth of 9% to $3.4 billion, driven by contributions from new and existing customers. Medical segment profit increased by 16% to $148 million. However, there was a decline in Cordis profit due to increased SG&A expenses to support the international infrastructure investment.

Looking ahead, the company revised its revenue growth expectations for full year 2017 to be in the mid to high single-digit percentages, and non-GAAP EPS to be at the bottom of the $5.35 to $5.50 range. The company is likely to use debt financing for the acquisition of the Patient Recovery business from Medtronic, which may result in up to $0.05 of financing cost.

The company also expects a low double-digit decline in Pharma segment profit for the full fiscal year, primarily due to generic market pricing. However, the Medical segment's revenue growth is expected to be at a high single-digit percentage increase versus the prior year.

Overall, the company remains optimistic about its long-term prospects and is focused on maintaining strong operational discipline and expense management. As a financial analyst, I would recommend an 'overweight' investment stance based on the company's strong revenue growth, positive bottom-line growth in the Medical segment, and the company's proactive approach to managing expenses and investment in infrastructure for future growth.
