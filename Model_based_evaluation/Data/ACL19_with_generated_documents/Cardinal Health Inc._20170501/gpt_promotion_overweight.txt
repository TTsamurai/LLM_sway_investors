Given the information provided, it is clear that the company has seen growth in its third-quarter performance. Total company revenues grew by 4% to $31.8 billion, with consolidated GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin dollars increasing by 2% and 1%, respectively. Pharmaceutical segment revenues grew 3% to $28.4 billion, and Medical segment revenues grew 9% to $3.4 billion. However, the company did experience declines in segment profits due to factors such as generic pharmaceutical pricing, loss of Safeway, and investment in pharmaceutical IT platform.

Looking forward, the company expects full year 2017 revenue growth to be in the mid to high single-digit percentages. The company also anticipates continued growth in the Medical segment and a return to growth in the Cordis business in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the company expects the deflation rate to improve and brand sales decline to be already factored into the guidance for 2017 and 2018.

Despite some challenges in certain segments, the company is well-positioned for both the near term and long term.

With a focus on disciplined expense management and improving deflation rates, the company is working on the right things at the right pace. It appears that the company has a clear strategy for addressing challenges and is confident in its ability to generate significant cash flow in the fourth quarter. Therefore, it is recommended to consider an 'overweight' investment stance based on the company's recent performance and outlook.
