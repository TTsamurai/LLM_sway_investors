We do notice an increase in Invisalign case submissions with digital scanners in North America, which is a positive sign for Invisalign utilization. Our scanner revenues have also increased, although there was a slight decrease in sequential growth as expected due to a typical capital equipment buying cycle. Our focus on the teen market has also been successful, with a significant increase in teen case shipments both sequentially and year-over-year. We have introduced new products such as Invisalign Lite and Invisalign Go to target teenage and adult patients, which has been well-received. We are also seeing positive engagement in our new global Made to Move campaign, which has led to higher followers across our social media channels. Our partnership with SmileDirectClub has also contributed to solid shipments, and we remain excited about the potential for the at-home doctor-directed market. Our expansion in Brazil and acquisition of distributors in EMEA have positioned us well for long-term growth in these regions. Overall, our strategic growth drivers are performing well, and we expect to see continued success in the upcoming quarters. We look forward to the upcoming financial conference and meetings to share more about our progress and future plans.
