involved in. So, I think it's a good story. Don't know what's going to happen from here, but we're going to over-spend time with every DSO, trying to expand best practices and really bring more of their patients into the lifecycle that we're talking about that can make us really grow. I don't know, Jon. We could look at it on a different level of how you look at efficiency whether you can have the claims and all that, but it really says the strength I think, in the end of this whole thing comes to permitting the adoption of new technology in their practices than anything else. And I think, about I don't want to quantify it in any way or reduce it to any statistic, the fact that they do adopt Invisalign technology and embrace it, it's a signal for all customers to come and adopt Invisalign also. It's a big story when a group as big as DSOs can lead the way in market share gain in this kind of technology. I think that's the way we have to look at it. No, Jon, it's – it impresses me. I can't give you any statistics other than my feel, which is that when the doctors see the younger generation coming into their practice and they're able to treat them effectively and either the young male or the teenage female, that signs their practice up for an expansive future, don't you think? Yeah, Jon, the way – we always have a way to get to the GP practice. And I always love seeing a reaction in the GP's practice and I think we're getting that. We're always driving to go after primary care also. Primary care doesn't have to mean just doctor's primary care. But we know that GP doctors can do a good job and we know we can scale continuously with our brand power and the software that we've created. And pack up the idea that an ortho will co-join with a GP and allow more streamlining of patients and develop efficiencies and et cetera like that. And there's still, the big story is the clear aligner. There's still big growth opportunities in this space. It's pretty amazing, Jon, given the depth of experience I have here, I still find it fascinating to see the speed of adoption and how it's different in every practice. And the way I would say it is the instruments are always same but the music is different. So, it's always, I look at it that way. All right, Jon. No, it's fine._CheckedChanged

Summary Report:

Align Technology Inc. has had a successful first quarter of 2017, with revenues, volumes, gross margin, and EPS all above expectations. The growth in Invisalign case shipments, particularly among teenagers, and the expansion of the iTero scanner revenues have contributed to this success. The company saw an increase in market share for metal braces, with higher utilization by teenagers and growth among adult consumers. In Q1, Align launched Invisalign Lite and Invisalign Go in North America, as well as expanding its presence in international markets, particularly in EMEA and APAC.

The acquisition of a distributor in Brazil, the launch of Invisalign Teen with mandibular advancement, and the expansion of the Made to Move campaign have all contributed to the company's growth. The use of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization, with a record percentage of cases submitted digitally in North America. In Q1, Align began supplying clear aligners to SmileDirectClub, a new channel that has shown solid shipments, despite initial industry anxiety about the partnership.

The company's continued focus on strategic growth drivers and the overall health of the dental industry has positioned it well for future growth. The expansion of the DSO industry, particularly in embracing new technology and innovation, has been a key factor in driving market share gains for Align. The success of the Invisalign technology in DSOs is a signal for broader adoption in the market.

Overall, while the company has seen strong growth and adoption of its products, particularly among teenagers, there are still challenges in the market. The partnership with SmileDirectClub has caused some industry turmoil and anxiety among existing customers, and there is ongoing concern about the impact of competing clear aligner companies in the market.

Based on the transcript of the earnings conference call, Align Technology Inc. appears to be performing well and demonstrating strong growth in several key financial metrics. However, there are potential challenges, such as industry anxiety over partnerships with new channels and the entry of competing companies into the market. Given these factors, a cautious or 'underweight' investment stance may be warranted for Align Technology Inc., pending further evaluation of its market positioning and potential for future growth.
