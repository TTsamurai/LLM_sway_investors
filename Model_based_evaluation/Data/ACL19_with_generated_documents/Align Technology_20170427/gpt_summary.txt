. We are also seeing growth in our digital scanner sales, especially among non-Invisalign accounts. This is a positive trend that we will continue to monitor and capitalize on. Additionally, our partnerships with DSOs are driving significant growth in case shipments, and we are working with them to leverage our technology and digital marketing to further accelerate the industry shift to full digital practices. Our recent acquisitions in Brazil and EMEA, along with our expansion in the Asia Pacific region, have positioned us for continued growth and leadership in the global market. Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to updating you on our progress in the upcoming financial conference and meetings.
