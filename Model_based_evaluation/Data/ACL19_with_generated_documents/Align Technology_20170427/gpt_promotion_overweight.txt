They can get things done much quicker and more effectively than if we were just talking to individual practices. So we really believe in the potential of DSOs and their ability to drive growth in the orthodontic market. The consumer preference for digital experiences is also a big factor in our growth strategy. We're leveraging our technologies to provide patients with the digital experiences they want, and DSOs are leaders in adopting new technology and innovation in the dental industry. We're working together to help accelerate the industry shift to digital practices much quicker and more effectively than with other companies. With the recent acquisition of our distributor in Brazil, we are establishing our leadership position in Latin America and are excited about the growth potential in that market. Our growth in both the EMEA and APAC regions is very promising and we are confident in our ability to continue driving growth internationally. The success of our new global Made to Move campaign is already driving higher engagement in digital media and we are excited to extend the campaign to other key country markets. Our scanner revenues have also seen strong growth, and we are continuing to expand our presence among GPs in EMEA. Overall, we are pleased with the continued progress and execution of our strategic growth drivers, and are confident in our ability to drive growth in the second quarter and beyond. We look forward to sharing more at the upcoming financial conference and meetings. Thank you for joining us today.
