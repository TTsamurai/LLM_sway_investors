and their ability to scale operations. This partnership has helped drive the growth of Invisalign shipments to DSO practices, with shipments increasing nearly 50% year-over-year in the first quarter. This demonstrates the potential for further growth and adoption of Invisalign treatment in the DSO industry. The company's expansion into Latin America, specifically through the acquisition of a distributor in Brazil, provides access to a market estimated to have approximately 1.4 million new orthodontic case starts each year, making it a significant growth opportunity for the company.

Furthermore, the company's continued growth in the EMEA and APAC regions, with record volumes and expansion of the Invisalign teen market, shows strong international market potential. The introduction of new products, such as Invisalign Lite and Invisalign Teen with mandibular advancement in international markets, demonstrates the company's commitment to innovation and expansion.

The company's focus on digital experiences and leveraging its technologies to work with DSOs in transitioning to fully digital practices aligns with the industry shift towards consumer preference for digital solutions. This strategic approach positions the company as a leader in facilitating digital transformation in the dental industry.

Additionally, the company's success in driving consumer demand through marketing campaigns, such as the global Made to Move campaign, and partnerships with channels like SmileDirectClub, indicates strong consumer interest and potential for continued growth in the at-home doctor-directed market.

Overall, the company's strong financial results, strategic acquisitions, and expansion into new markets demonstrate a positive outlook for future growth and investment opportunities. Based on these key insights and financial metrics derived from the recent earnings conference call transcript, an 'overweight' investment stance for the company is justified.
