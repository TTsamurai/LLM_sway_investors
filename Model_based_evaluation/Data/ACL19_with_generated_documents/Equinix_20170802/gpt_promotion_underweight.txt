Based on the recent earnings call, the company is experiencing solid momentum and success with customers, reflected in their financial performance and ecosystem growth. However, it is important to note that the company has recently completed the acquisition of Verizon's Americas data center portfolio, and despite the positive feedback from customers, there is still a level of uncertainty around the integration of these assets and the potential for churn. The company has also made heavy investments in the cost model, impacting their AFFO and EBITDA. Additionally, the company is focusing on catching the next wave of cloud architectures and edge computing, which brings a level of uncertainty to their future plans and investments. Therefore, based on these factors, a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company's future performance may warrant an 'underweight' investment stance.
