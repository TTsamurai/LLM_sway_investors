**Future Outlook Report**

**Company: Equinix**

**Investment Stance: Overweight**

1. **Executive Summary:**
   Equinix has demonstrated robust financial performance in Q2 2017, driven by strategic acquisitions, expansion in high-growth markets, and strong demand across its cloud and networking services. The acquisition of Verizon's Americas data center portfolio significantly enhances Equinix's market positioning, adding strategic assets. This growth, coupled with ongoing expansions in cloud exchange services and strong interconnection revenue growth, underscores our 'Overweight' recommendation.

2. **Financial Performance:**
   - **Revenue Growth:** In Q2 2017, Equinix's revenues hit $1.066 billion, a notable 11% increase year-over-year.
   - **Adjusted EBITDA:** Reached $509 million, demonstrating a stable increase of 10% over the previous year.
   - **Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO):** Grew by 17% year-over-year, indicating efficient operational management and profitability.
   
3. **Strategic Developments:**
   - **Verizon Portfolio Acquisition:** Boosts Equinix’s capacity and market presence, immediately contributing to revenue through new accounts and low-hanging fruit for cross-selling with existing customers.
   - **Global Expansion:** Noteworthy entries into new markets like Bogotá, Houston, and Culpeper, alongside expansions in data center capacity across significant markets like Frankfurt, Silicon Valley, and Amsterdam.
   - **Cloud Services Expansion:** AWS, Microsoft Azure, Salesforce, Alibaba, and Tencent notably expanded into new metros through Equinix’s Cloud Exchange, enhancing its role as a leader in cloud interconnectivity.
  
4. **Market and Industry Analysis:**
   - The burgeoning demand for hybrid cloud services and secured, distributed interconnection aligns well with Equinix's core offerings. The acquisition-enhanced footprint positions Equinix to capably serve a widening array of large enterprise customers, including an increased focus on government contracts post-Verizon acquisition.
   - A shift towards Interconnection Oriented Architectures (IOA) and multi-cloud IT deployments is especially beneficial for Equinix, whose interconnection revenue grew by 17% year-over-year.
  
5. **Competitive Positioning:**
   - Equinix continues to secure critical lighthouse accounts, now servicing 42% of the Fortune 500 and 30% of the Global 2000 companies.
   - The strategic placement of its data centers and focus on securing data passage points like submarine cable connections (e.g., Eastern Light cable) enhance its competitive moat.
  
6. **Risks and Considerations:**
   - **Integration Risks:** The integration of the vast Verizon assets must be managed meticulously to avoid service disruptions and maximize the potential for cross-selling.
   - **Market Competition:** Intensified competition in cloud services and data center operations requires continuous innovation and investment.
  
7. **Financial Outlook:**
   - **Short to Mid-term:** We anticipate continued robust revenue growth driven by the expanded service offerings and geographical footprint. The investments in the Verizon assets are expected to gradually reflect in improved earnings and reduced churn.
   - **Long-term:** Strategic global expansions and a fortified portfolio of interconnection and cloud services should sustain high single to double-digit growth rates in revenue and AFFO.

8. **Conclusion:**
   Equinix’s strategic acquisitions, such as the Verizon data centers, alongside organic growth initiatives, position the company to leverage increasing global demand for interconnected data solutions and cloud services effectively. This integration not only boosts its immediate financial profile but sets a solid foundation for sustainable long-term growth. The continuously expanding footprint and service enhancements, especially in strategic, high-demand markets, reinforce our 'Overweight' stance, reflecting a positive outlook on the company’s financial prospects and market position.
