. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2017 earnings call. We believe that Martin Marietta performed exceptionally well, setting records or near records on many key financial metrics. With strong top-line growth, solid profitability, and cash flow generation, we believe we are well-positioned for continued success in the construction industry. Our full year 2017 guidance reflects our confidence in our ability to grow volume, maintain strong pricing, and expand margins across our business. We are particularly encouraged by the growth in our Building Materials business and the record first quarter delivered by our Magnesia Specialties business.

We anticipate robust market conditions and a vibrant 2017 construction season. Our long-term outlook is consistent with forecasts from third-party data and analytics providers, supporting our confidence in the ongoing multi-year construction recovery. We have remained steadfast in our strategic planning process and are committed to our core foundational pillars, such as world-class safety, ethical conduct, operational excellence, cost discipline, customer satisfaction, and sustainability.

Additionally, we have remained focused on allocating capital appropriately, investing in our businesses, and returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our outlook for the remainder of 2017 and beyond remains optimistic, and we anticipate another record year with net sales ranging from $3.750 billion to $3.950 billion.

We look forward to discussing our second quarter results with you in August and appreciate your continued support. Thank you.
