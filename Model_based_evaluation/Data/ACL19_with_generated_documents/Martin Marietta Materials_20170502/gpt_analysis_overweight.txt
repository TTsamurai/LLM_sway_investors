. Thank you. Based on the analysis of this transcript, we believe there are strong key insights and financial metrics that support an 'overweight' investment stance. The company has reported record net sales, and near-record earnings per share in the first quarter of 2017. Additionally, their guidance for full-year 2017 reflects confidence in their ability to capitalize on the country's macroeconomic momentum and deliver volume growth, strong pricing, and expanding margins. The construction recovery across the company's markets, job growth in key markets, and consistent construction activity, particularly in the residential and non-residential sectors, point towards a vibrant 2017 construction season. The company's strategic planning process, disciplined operational execution, and commercial performance have positioned them well to meet increasing customer demand as the durable economic recovery continues. Overall, the company's profitability outlook is the strongest it has ever been. With sustained employment growth, consistent third-party forecasters' support, and expected growth in construction starts for the next several years, the company's multi-year outlook remains optimistic. Therefore, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance in Martin Marietta based on these key insights and financial metrics.
