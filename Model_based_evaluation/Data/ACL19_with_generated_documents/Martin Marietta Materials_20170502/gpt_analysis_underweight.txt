. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2017 earnings call. Based on the information provided, we have identified several key insights and financial metrics that support our analysis and decision to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for Martin Marietta. Here are some key points from the earnings call:

1. Strong Financial Performance: Martin Marietta had a record first quarter performance with record net sales, consolidated gross profit, and near-record earnings per diluted share. The company's growth translated to near-record first quarter EBITDA and operating cash flow.

2. Growth in Building Materials Business: The Building Materials business, including aggregates, ready mixed concrete, and asphalt product lines, reported volume gains and gross margin performance. The Southeast Group led gross margin performance with a 120 basis point expansion.

3. Strong Outlook for Construction Activity: The company is confident in its outlook for increased levels of construction activity across key markets, driven by sustained employment growth and positive employment data from key states. This includes steady multi-year residential demand growth, positive trends in non-residential growth, and increased infrastructure construction activity.

4. Capital Allocation and Investments: Martin Marietta has invested in its businesses and returned a significant amount to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The company is maintaining financial discipline and remains focused on the careful execution of its strategic plan.

5. Expectations for Increased Construction Demand: The company expects aggregates product line infrastructure shipments to increase in the mid-single digits, nonresidential volumes to increase in the low to mid-single digits, and residential shipments to increase in the mid to high-single digits.

6. Regulatory and Legislative Environment: The company is monitoring potential regulatory relief and infrastructure investment at both the federal and state level. There is anticipation that state-led initiatives and potential federal infrastructure investment will have positive impacts on construction activity.

Based on these insights and financial metrics, we believe that Martin Marietta's strong performance and positive outlook for construction activity position the company for growth. However, given some potential challenges in certain markets and the need for careful execution of its strategic plan, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance at this time. We will continue to monitor the company's performance and reassess our recommendation as new information becomes available.
