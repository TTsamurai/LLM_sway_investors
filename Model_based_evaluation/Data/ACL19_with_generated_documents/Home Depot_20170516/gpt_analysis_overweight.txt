ths of a point. As we look at the holiday season, long-term inventory positions are good. We should be in good shape for the holiday season. The goods news is that we're in a pretty good inventory position. Simeon, I think we've covered this quite extensively on the call, but just to summarize, our sales performance in the first quarter was better than expected. With positive comps in all three months of the quarter, and strong performance in our U.S. stores. Our expense leverage was also better than planned, and our effective tax rate is lower than last year. Our return on invested capital is significantly higher than last year, and we're seeing strong growth in our dot-com sales and services business. The housing market continues to show strong growth, and we're expecting solid sales growth for the year. Based on all of these factors, along with our strong balance sheet and continued investment in share buybacks, we believe that the company is well-positioned for future growth. Therefore, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance for this company.
