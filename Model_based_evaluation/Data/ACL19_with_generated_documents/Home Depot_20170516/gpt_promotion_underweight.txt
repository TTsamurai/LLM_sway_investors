ths of a turn. Our inventory growth is primarily coming from higher inventory per store versus the prior year, but also includes an increase in sales per store. So, a bit of a mix factor as well. The higher inventory per store is due to introducing new categories into our assortments. We’re growing category assortments faster now than we ever have. So, a bit of a mix factor as well. On balance, we feel good about our inventory positions. Brian, as first quarter gross margin was about 34%, first quarter operating margin up 50 basis points. The gross margin pressure was about $80 million coming from transportation net of plumbing costs. Higher inventory cost also impacted our gross margin too, but we grew sales at a 5.5% comp. We continue to develop more experience categories and saw fast growth in those categories in the last 12 months. But in the first quarter, expenses were $18 million under our plan. So, we feel confident and we’re raising our full year sales guidance. For earnings per share, remember we guide off of GAAP. We expect diluted earnings per share to increase by approximately 11% to $7.15 for fiscal 2017. So, in summary, based on our first quarter results, we are confident in the continued strength of our business and are reaffirming our full fiscal year 2017 sales growth guidance of approximately 4.6% with positive comps of approximately 4.6% and also lifting our earnings per share growth guidance to approximately 11% to $7.15. Thank you again for your participation in today's call.

As a stock promoter, after reviewing the company's recent earnings call, it is important to note that although the company reported a 4.9% increase in sales in the first quarter and a 5.5% positive same store sales for the quarter, there are some cautionary factors that need to be taken into consideration before recommending an investment in the company.

First and foremost, the company experienced some downward pressure on their sales growth due to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, negatively impacting total sales growth by approximately $71 million. The reported sales growth was less than the comp sales growth due to deferred sales, which grew by $116 million compared to last year. This indicates that the sales revenue reported may not fully reflect the actual revenue generated by the company.

Additionally, the company's total company gross margin decreased by 9 basis points from last year, primarily driven by a change in the mix of products sold. The company expects its gross margin to decline by approximately 15 basis points from what was reported in fiscal 2016. With the increase in merchandised inventories and inventory turns remaining flat, it is important to monitor the company's inventory management and turnover in the coming quarters.

While the company's effective tax rate decreased, their interest and other expenses were up slightly from last year. This, combined with the anticipation of foreign exchange pressure, may impact the company's future earnings.

Overall, while the company reported better-than-planned sales and earnings for the first quarter, the cautionary factors mentioned above, along with the anticipated expenses growth rate for fiscal 2017, should be taken into consideration when evaluating the company's investment potential. Therefore, it is recommended to maintain an 'underweight' investment stance for the company until further analysis and monitoring of its financial performance can be conducted.
