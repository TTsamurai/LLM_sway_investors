basis points improved over the prior year. Yes, we do anticipate that the timing of Easter next year may create some headwind in the April period, but we don't expect it to have a material impact on our overall sales growth for fiscal 2017. Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter sales and earnings performance. Sales were better than planned and we are reaffirming our sales growth guidance for fiscal 2017 at 4.6%. Additionally, with our first quarter expense performance, we are raising our earnings per share growth guidance to approximately 11% to $7.15 for the full fiscal year. Given our strong financial results and positive outlook, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company based on its recent earnings call. Thank you for your attention and for considering our recommendation.
