 backlog was up 2%, but with 4 points attributed to the acquisitions. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.61, down 5% as reported, and CFFO was $298 million, up 54% as reported. We expect total revenue to increase by approximately 4% for the full year.

Despite the positive spin presented in the earnings call, there are several red flags that lead us to recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. While total revenue was up 3% as reported and up 4% in constant currency, this growth was largely driven by acquisitions, which contributed approximately 6 points to total revenue growth in the quarter. Organic new sales were down in the mid-20s, and organic new sales were down in the mid-30s, indicating a significant decline in core business performance.

The company's GAAP diluted earnings per share was down 11% as reported and down 4% in constant currency, while non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was down 5% as reported and down 3% in constant currency. This suggests that the company's profitability is declining, despite the positive performance touted in the earnings call.

Furthermore, the company's Q1 GAAP operating margin was 26%, while non-GAAP operating margin was 37%. This discrepancy between GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins raises questions about the company's financial reporting practices and transparency.

Additionally, the company's services revenue was down 3% as reported and down 2% in constant currency, reflecting a decline in demand for the company's services. The decline in services revenue coupled with the lower organic new sales indicates a broader weakness in the company's core business.

In light of these factors, we advise caution in investing in this company and recommend an 'underweight' investment stance until there is evidence of sustained and meaningful improvement in core business performance.
