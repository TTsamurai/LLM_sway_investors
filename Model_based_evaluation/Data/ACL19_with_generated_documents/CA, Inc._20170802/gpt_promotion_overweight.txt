 revenue backlog also improved 6%, with 4% attributed to the acquisitions. This demonstrates the impact and success of the recent acquisitions of Automic and Veracode. Additionally, the improvements in product and operational integrations from these acquisitions exceeded our expectations. Our overall financial performance for the quarter, including revenue, operating margin, EPS, and CFFO, exceeded our expectations. This demonstrates our ongoing strength in the market and the success of our organically-developed products like Data Content Discovery and Mainframe Operations Intelligence.

Based on this positive performance and the anticipated growth, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company's guidance for the full year suggests continued momentum and outperformance of key metrics, with an expected increase in total revenue of approximately 4%. This growth is expected to continue throughout the year, with a projected growth rate in constant currency between 4% and 5% in the second half of the fiscal year. Additionally, the company expects GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be down only 2% to flat, both as reported and in constant currency, demonstrating a strong financial position.

Overall, the company's recent earnings call and guidance for the full year indicate a strong performance and potential for growth, making it an attractive investment opportunity for a position that is 'overweight' in a diversified portfolio.
