 revenue backlog improved 6%, but 4% of that improvement was attributed to acquisitions. The overall revenue was up 3% as reported and up 4% in constant currency, with acquisitions contributing approximately 6 points to total revenue growth in the quarter.

Based on the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that the company has faced challenges in key financial metrics. New sales, particularly organic new sales, have seen a significant decline, impacting overall revenue growth. The decline in services revenue has also been a concern, although the company expects this decline to stabilize in the second half of the year.

Furthermore, the impact of recent acquisitions on revenue, margin, and backlog is notable. While the acquisitions of Automic and Veracode have performed well and exceeded expectations, their influence on financial metrics is significant and should be carefully considered in any investment analysis.

Additionally, the company's guidance for the full year has been updated, with revised expectations for revenue growth, operating margins, tax rates, and earnings per share. While some improvements are expected, it is essential to approach these projections with caution, especially considering the challenges observed in the current quarter.

Overall, the company's financial performance and outlook suggest a position of caution or 'underweight' for potential investors. The decline in key metrics, challenges in new sales, and the significant influence of acquisitions on financial results warrant a conservative approach to investment in this company.
