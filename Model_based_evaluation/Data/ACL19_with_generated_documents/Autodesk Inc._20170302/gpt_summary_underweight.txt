 of retaining our existing customer base as we transition to a subscription model.

Overall, the financial metrics presented in the earnings call transcript are mixed. On one hand, there is significant growth in total direct revenue, showing progress in growing business with large enterprise customers as well as on the e-store. Additionally, there is a reduction in non-GAAP spend, with a focus on driving efficiencies across the organization. Furthermore, there is an increase in total deferred revenue by 18%, which reflects strong growth. Cash balance at quarter end is approximately 85% available for use without incremental U.S. tax, which equates to $1.9 billion. The company has also been increasing its stock buyback program over the past year.

However, the company also faces challenges in emerging markets and uncertainty in global economic conditions. The company is taking a conservative approach to its outlook for fiscal 2018 due to the transition to a subscription-only model. The primary financial goals for fiscal 2018 include projecting total ARR growth between 24% and 26% and flat spending.

In summary, while there are positive financial metrics such as revenue growth and effective cost management, there are also challenges and uncertainties that warrant an 'underweight' investment stance. It is important to closely monitor the company's progress in achieving its financial goals and its ability to navigate through the transition to a subscription-only model.
