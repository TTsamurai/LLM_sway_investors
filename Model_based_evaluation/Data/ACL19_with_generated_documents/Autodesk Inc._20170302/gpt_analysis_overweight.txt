 of retaining as many maintenance customers as possible. 

Based on the insights and financial metrics from the earnings conference call transcript, it is clear that the company is making significant progress in its transition to a subscription-only model. Key points to note include the increase in direct revenue, reduced spend management, and a commitment to maintaining flat spending in the coming fiscal year.

In terms of financial metrics, the company's total deferred revenue grew by 18% against tough comparisons from the previous year, and the company has approximately $1.9 billion in cash that can be used without incremental U.S. tax. Additionally, the company has been steadily reducing its basic share count over the past two years.

Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, the company is projecting total annual recurring revenue (ARR) growth to increase to between 24% and 26%, with subscription additions projected to increase by 600,000 to 650,000. The company also aims to keep spending flat and expects the percentage of recurring revenue to increase to approximately 90%. The company plans to focus on transparency in its revenue reporting by breaking out subscription, maintenance, and other revenue lines.

The overall outlook for the company is positive, with the CEO expressing confidence in the transition and setting ambitious financial goals for fiscal 2018. Additionally, the company is focused on minimizing churn from its maintenance base as it moves to a subscription-only model.

Based on these insights and financial metrics, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for the company. The company's progress in its transition to a subscription-only model, strong financial performance, and commitment to maintaining flat spending are positive indicators for future growth and profitability. Therefore, an 'overweight' investment stance reflects confidence in the company's potential for long-term success.
