of retaining our maintenance customers. Our targets and financial goals for fiscal 2018 include a projected total ARR growth of 24-26% and an increase in subscription additions of 600,000 to 650,000, representing a 20% increase. We also aim to keep spending flat and expect the percentage of recurring revenue to increase to approximately 90% beginning in Q1.

One noteworthy item is our focus on reducing non-GAAP spend by 3% for the fiscal year and 4% in the fourth quarter, achieved through a restructuring and a relentless focus on driving efficiencies across the organization. We also intend to put the majority of our cash balance into our stock buyback program over the next several quarters using both programmatic and opportunistic means.

Furthermore, considering the transition to subscription-only model, we have plans to further improve the transparency of our revenue reporting by separating revenue lines for subscription, maintenance, and other revenue. This change will enable better isolation of non-recurring revenues and improve the link between our financials and business model transition.

Regarding the CEO transition, we have full confidence in Andrew and Amar to lead the company to continued success. We are pleased with our Q4 and full-year fiscal 2017 results and remain committed to achieving our long-term targets.

In conclusion, our momentum, combined with factors such as license compliance, cloud momentum, and changes in product, gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our financial targets for fiscal 2018.
