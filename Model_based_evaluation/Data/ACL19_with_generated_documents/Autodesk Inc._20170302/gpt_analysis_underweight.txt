The company's financial metrics indicate strong growth in direct revenue and a focus on expense management that has resulted in reduced spending. Additionally, the company has seen significant growth in deferred revenue, indicating a strong outlook for future revenue. The company also has a strong cash balance and plans to use a majority of it for stock buyback programs.

However, the company's outlook for fiscal 2018 is conservative due to the transition to a subscription-only model, and the impact of global economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets. The company's primary financial goals for fiscal 2018 include projected total ARR growth of 24-26% and an increase in subscription additions.

The company's focus on maintaining customer loyalty and minimizing churn from the maintenance base indicates a cautious approach to the transition to a subscription model. This, combined with the uncertainty of global economic conditions, suggests a potential underweight investment stance for the company.

Overall, the company's financial metrics indicate strong growth potential, but the conservative outlook and potential challenges in the global market suggest a cautious investment approach.
