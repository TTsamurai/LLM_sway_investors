### Future Outlook Report: Underweight Stance on Autodesk

#### Executive Summary
This report outlines the basis for an 'underweight' investment recommendation on Autodesk. Despite some optimistic signs in their recent earnings report for fiscal 2017, looming challenges and uncertainties in various operational and market aspects lead to a cautious outlook for fiscal 2018 and beyond.

#### Financial Overview
Autodesk has reported increased revenue growth in Q4 fiscal 2017, mainly attributed to its shifting revenue model from licenses to subscriptions. However, while revenue from direct sales is growing, representing 32% of total revenues—an increase from the previous year—other financial metrics warrant a closer examination. 

**Key Points:**
- **Deferred Revenue**: Growth remained strong at 18%, yet this was expected due to the transition towards a subscription model largely replacing perpetual licenses.
- **Expense Management**: Autodesk succeeded in reducing non-GAAP expenses by 3-4% in fiscal 2017, also influenced by a company restructuring that led to layoffs.
- **Cash Utilization**: Notably, there is an increased allocation towards share buybacks, reflecting possibly a lack of robust investment opportunities within the company or attempts to pacify investors amidst transition-related earnings volatility.

#### Market and Strategic Analysis
**Market Conditions**: While mature markets show relatively stable performance, emerging markets continue to pose challenges. Additionally, the unclear economic impact from changes in U.S. policy and Brexit induces further uncertainty.

**Transition to Subscription Model**: Autodesk's move to a subscription-only model in fiscal 2018 is a significant shift intended to boost long-term revenue stability by promoting higher lifetime values and customer retention. However, this model relies heavily on consistent customer acquisition and retention during a period where global economic conditions are volatile.

**Stock Buyback Program**: The aggressive buyback program could be perceived as a strategy to improve earnings per share metrics amidst potential short-term revenue disruptions due to the transition.

#### Risks
- **Economic Uncertainty**: Economic conditions in key markets remain unpredictable, especially with potential policy changes in the U.S. and impacts from Brexit, adding risk to Autodesk’s earnings outlook.
- **Customer Transition**: The shift from maintenance to subscriptions could face resistance from existing customers, despite incentives.
- **Global Performance**: Autodesk has noted challenges in emerging markets, which could hinder growth and affect overall company performance.
- **Increased Competition**: As Autodesk adjusts its business model, competitors might seize the opportunity to capture market share, especially if transitions churn becomes higher than anticipated.

#### Competitive Landscape
Autodesk faces significant competition from other software providers who may leverage the transitional period to entice customers away. Competitors could exploit any dissatisfaction arising from pricing changes or adaptation to new subscription services.

#### Conclusion and Investment Rationale
Though Autodesk is implementing strategic transformations aimed at future growth and stability, near-term risks related to their aggressive transition to a subscription-based model, combined with economic uncertainties and operational challenges, justify an 'underweight' investment stance for the time being. The approach to stock buybacks and the management of foreign cash amid changing U.S. tax policy will also require close monitoring as these factors could impact financial performance and investor sentiment.

### Recommendation
Given the outlined considerations, it is recommended that investors maintain an 'underweight' stance on Autodesk, closely monitoring the company's adaptation to global market conditions, effectiveness in customer transition to subscriptions, and execution of its strategic initiatives.
