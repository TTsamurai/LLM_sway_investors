The firm reported record net income of $7 billion, EPS of $1.82 and a return on tangible common equity of 14% on revenue of $26.4 billion. A legal benefit of approximately $400 million after tax from a previously announced settlement involving the FDIC's Washington Mutual receivership was included in the result along with other notable items predominantly net result changes and legal expenses. Notable highlights for the quarter include average core loan growth of 8% year-on-year, double-digit consumer deposit growth, strong card sales, and merchant volume growth. Revenue of $26.4 billion was up $1.2 billion or 5% year-on-year, predominantly due to net interest income up approximately $900 million reflecting continued loan growth and the impact of higher rates. Fee revenue was up $300 million year-on-year, but adjusting for one-time items in both years was down modestly. Adjusted expense of $14.4B was up a little less than $400 million year-on-year with auto leases being the biggest driver, along with a higher FDIC surcharge and broader growth offset by lower compensation. Credit costs of $1.2 billion were down $187 million year-on-year on a new reserve build. The firm ended the quarter with a binding fully phased in CET 1 of 12.5% under the standardized approach, and also announced growth repurchase capacity of up to $19.4 billion over the next four quarters. Core loan growth was revised down to 8% year-over-year for the full year, and the firm remains committed to strategic investments for growth in their businesses. JPMorgan expects to operate with sufficiency of capital and liquidity and will update its views based on regulatory changes and market trends. The firm is supportive of changes to the calculation of operational risk, but notes that liquidity is managed with discipline, and the potential impact on regulatory disclosures will be debated with regulators. Overall, the firm is very pleased with its performance, with a broad strength across all businesses and solid growth outlook for the global economy, positioning JPMorgan well going forward.
