Thank you for providing the recent earnings conference call transcript. After analyzing the transcript, it is clear that while the company faced significant challenges due to the hurricanes, there are positive signs for its future performance.

Key Financial Metrics:

1. Earnings Per Share (EPS) Guidance: The company still anticipates staying within its EPS guidance for the year at a range of $7.35 to $7.40 a share, despite a $0.26 hit from the storms. This reflects the market's strong performance.

2. Double-Double Program: The company's Double-Double program has been successful, with earnings more than twice the 2014 EPS and a return on invested capital (ROIC) exceeding 10%. This program has been a positive driving force for the company's financial performance.

3. 2020 Vision Program: The company has launched the 2020 Vision program, focusing on improving guest ratings, raising employee engagement scores, and achieving sustainability commitments. These measures aim to achieve double-digit earnings per share by 2020 and improve return on invested capital.

4. Consumer Behavior and Booking Recovery: Despite the impact of the hurricanes on bookings, the company has experienced a rapid recovery in bookings, indicating a shift in consumer behavior towards resuming normal activities quickly after adverse events.

Investment Stance:

Despite the positive indicators mentioned above, the company's response to the hurricanes and its potential impact on future operations, as well as the substantial increase in supply, suggest a cautious investment approach. The company's ability to withstand the financial impact of the storms and its focus on driving future growth through programs such as Double-Double and 2020 Vision is commendable. However, the potential challenges posed by increased supply and the need for sustained yield growth should be closely monitored.

Based on the analysis of the earnings call transcript and the company's financial metrics, the recommendation is to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance, reflecting a cautious approach while acknowledging the company's positive initiatives for future growth.
