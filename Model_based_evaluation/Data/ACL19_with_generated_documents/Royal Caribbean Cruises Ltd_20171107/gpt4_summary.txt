### Summary of Key Financial Metrics Discussed in the Conference Call:

**Impact of Hurricanes:**
- The company faced a challenging quarter due to a series of major hurricanes affecting key trade routes.
- Direct costs incurred due to hurricane damage exceeded $55 million, marking it as the most expensive season in the company’s 45-year history.

**Responding to Disaster:**
- Despite the severe impact on bookings during the hurricane period, the company noted a rapid recovery in bookings to pre-storm levels shortly after the events. This resilience in booking bounce-back points to a changing consumer behavior indicating a shift to viewing such events as temporary disruptions rather than prolonged deterrents.

**Earnings Outlook:**
- The company reaffirmed its earnings per share (EPS) guidance for the year at $7.35 to $7.40 despite taking a $0.26 hit per share due to the storms. This adherence to forecasted profitability levels demonstrates robust underlying business strength.

**Major Milestones and Operational Achievements:**
- The company successfully achieved its "Double-Double" program goals three months ahead of schedule. This included doubling its 2014 earnings and exceeding a return on invested capital of 10% over the last 12 months. The initiative focused on aligning the company’s workforce towards sustained profitability and has been deemed successful.

**Future Strategic Programs:**
- With the completion of the Double-Double initiative, the company introduced the "2020 Vision" program focused on enhancing guest satisfaction, employee engagement, and sustainability commitments. Financial aims include achieving double-digit EPS by 2020 through various performance drivers beyond financial outcomes.

**Supply and Demand Dynamics:**
- Discussion highlighted significant changes in customer preferences towards experiential purchases, benefitting the cruise industry substantially. The company emphasizes its adaptability by modifying ship designs and onboard offerings to align with contemporary consumer preferences.

**Capital Investments and Technological Enhancements:**
- Announced ongoing refurbishments under the Royal Amplified and Celebrity Revolution programs and technological improvements through the Excalibur project, aiming to modernize the fleet and enhance guest experiences.

**Outlook on Consumer Demand and Booking Trends:**
- Observations pointed to a robust year driven by strong economic conditions and high consumer confidence. Even though an increased supply is expected in the coming years, bolstered demand is likely to sustain growth. Forward-looking statements predict continued yield growth, albeit at moderate, realistic rates reflecting market equilibrium between supply expansion and escalating consumer interest.

**Operational Highlights:**
- Several fleet additions and renovations are planned, including the introduction of new ships such as Spectrum of the Seas and Symphony of the Seas, aimed at expanding market presence and catering to specific regional demands. 

The overall sentiment conveyed in the earnings call was one of robust resilience, strategical foresight, and strong operational execution despite environmental and market challenges. The company remains positioned to drive forward with ambitious growth and innovation targets while maintaining a strong focus on customer experience and sustainability.
