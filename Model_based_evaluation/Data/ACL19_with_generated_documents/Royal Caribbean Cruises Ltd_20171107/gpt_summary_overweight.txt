Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, there are several key financial metrics that demonstrate the company's resilience and continuous growth despite facing significant challenges. The company reported an estimated direct cost of over $55 million due to a series of hurricanes, making it the most expensive hurricane season in its 45-year history. However, the company has shown strong recovery in the tourism industry, with tourist areas largely back to their original state and a rapid recovery in bookings after the storms.

The financial impact of the storms was a $0.26 hit on the company's earnings per share (EPS) for the year. Despite this, the company has remained within its EPS guidance range of $7.35 to $7.40 per share, demonstrating strong profitability in the face of significant challenges.

Additionally, the company's Double-Double program has achieved significant milestones, with earnings more than twice the 2014 EPS and a return on invested capital (ROIC) exceeding 10%. This program has been successful in driving the company's financial performance and employee engagement.

Looking ahead, the company has launched a new program called 2020 Vision, aimed at further improving guest ratings, raising employee engagement scores, and achieving sustainability commitments. This program is expected to drive double-digit earnings per share by 2020, reflecting the company's forward momentum and long-term financial goals.

Furthermore, the company's investment in new ships and ship modernization programs, such as the Quantum Ultra Class ship and the Celebrity Revolution and Royal Amplified programs, demonstrates a commitment to driving future growth and profitability. These updates align with evolving consumer preferences for more active and experiential vacations, reflecting the company's ability to adapt to changing consumer trends and drive demand for its products.

Overall, the company's strong financial performance and strategic initiatives, combined with its ability to overcome challenges and adapt to evolving market trends, support an 'overweight' investment stance. Despite the impact of the hurricanes, the company has demonstrated resilience, profitability, and a commitment to long-term growth, making it a favorable investment opportunity.
