 to the original plan. And on your question about the impact of the hurricanes on our earnings outlook, I think it's important to note that while the storms did have a significant direct cost to us, we have been able to maintain our earnings per share guidance for the year. This is a testament to the resilience of our organization and the strength of the market. We have been able to absorb the impact of the storms and still achieve our financial targets. This is a reflection of the overall positive trends we are seeing in the industry and the continued strong demand for cruising. We believe that our ability to weather these storms and maintain our financial performance reflects the underlying strength of our business and the industry as a whole. We are also excited about our future initiatives, such as the 2020 Vision program and our investments in new ships and technology. We believe these initiatives will further drive growth and success for our company. Thank you for your continued support and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming months.
