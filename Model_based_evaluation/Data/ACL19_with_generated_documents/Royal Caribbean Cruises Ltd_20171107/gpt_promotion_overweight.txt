As a stock promoter, based on the recent earnings call, I believe there is a strong case for an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. Despite the unprecedented hurricane season causing over $55 million in direct costs, the company has shown resilience and is making a strong recovery. The rapid recovery of bookings in the Caribbean region following the storms demonstrates a cultural shift in consumer response to unusual events, which has positive implications for the company's future bookings and profitability.

Furthermore, the company has achieved its Double-Double program goals three months ahead of schedule, with earnings more than twice that of 2014 and a return on invested capital exceeding 10%. The 2020 Vision program aims to further improve guest ratings, employee engagement scores, and sustainability commitments, with the goal of achieving double-digit earnings per share by 2020. The company's shift in ship designs to accommodate changing consumer vacation preferences has also resulted in increased demand and relevance of cruising as a desirable vacation option.

Additionally, the company's strategic investments in the Chinese market, technological advancements, and fleet modernization programs further support the potential for future growth and success. While there may be challenges related to higher supply in the industry, the company's strong consumer demand and focus on driving consumer behavior to purchase cruises position it well for continued success.

Overall, I believe the company's strong performance, strategic initiatives, and cultural shifts in consumer vacation preferences make a compelling case for an 'overweight' investment stance.
