Based on the recent earnings call, it is evident that the company has faced significant financial challenges due to the impact of hurricanes on their operations. The direct cost of the storms was estimated to be over $55 million, making it the most expensive hurricane season in the company's history. The impact of the storms on the company's bookings was also substantial, leading to a rapid drop in bookings during the storm period, but a quick recovery afterwards.

In addition, the company is facing challenges related to supply and demand dynamics. The increase in supply of new ships may lead to a moderation in yield growth, and the company is cautious about assuming that the strong performance of 2017 will continue indefinitely. The company's new 2020 Vision program aims to focus on the drivers of success, such as guest satisfaction and engagement, to achieve double-digit earnings per share by 2020. However, it is important to note that the success of the program was intended to drive internal business performance and may not translate directly into financial targets for investors.

Furthermore, despite the company's confidence in their new digital system, the rollout of Excalibur has been delayed due to the disruptions caused by the hurricanes.

In conclusion, given the financial challenges faced by the company, the cautious outlook on supply and demand dynamics, and the delay in the rollout of the digital system, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. The recent earnings call highlights a number of concerns and challenges that may impact the company's future financial performance.
