Based on the information from the recent earnings conference call transcript, the company has shown strong financial performance in the third quarter of 2017. The consolidated revenue increased by 15%, with a notable 8% organic growth rate, indicating positive momentum. Adjusted gross margin improved by about 70 basis points, driven by acquisitions and improved manufacturing costs. The adjusted net income and EPS also showed healthy increases of 11% and 8% respectively.

Furthermore, the company maintained a strong cash flow from operations, which was 143% of adjusted net income for the quarter and 116% year-to-date. The company fully repaid its outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and returned $21 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. It also increased its cash balance by $33 million to $437 million at the end of the quarter.

Revenue growth was notable in the U.S. and Europe, with weakness in the Middle East region due to slower activity in the Surveillance segment. The company also secured a significant $75 million order from the U.S. Army for gimbels, driving surveillance bookings and increasing backlog.

In terms of segment performance, the Surveillance segment recorded a strong 8% revenue growth and consistent operating margins. The Detection segment saw a 19% revenue growth, and the Instruments segment experienced an 11% increase in revenue. The OEM and Emerging segment also showed significant growth of 39% in revenue.

The company's Security segment revenue increased by 16% due to significant growth in LOREX business and FLIR-branded Professional Visible Security solutions. The Maritime segment also saw a 4% revenue growth, despite the negative impact of hurricanes in the U.S.

Additionally, the company expressed a commitment to continue its acquisitive strategy and maintained a strong financial position, with the ability to leverage its investment-grade rating for potential deals. The management emphasized the importance of having the bandwidth and firepower for future acquisitions, indicating a positive outlook for future growth opportunities.

Based on these insights and strong financial metrics, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for the company. The company's solid financial performance, strong revenue growth, and strategic focus on acquisitions position it well for continued success and potential value appreciation for investors.
