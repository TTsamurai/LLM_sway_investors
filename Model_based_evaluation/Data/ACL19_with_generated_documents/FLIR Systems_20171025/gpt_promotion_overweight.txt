Based on the recent earnings call, the company showed strong financial performance with a 15% increase in consolidated revenue and a 8% organic growth rate compared to the previous year. The adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2017 was up 11% to $72.7 million and adjusted EPS was $0.52 per share, 8% higher than last year. Despite a 370-basis point increase in the effective tax rate, the company expects a full-year adjusted tax rate of approximately 25.5%. The company also demonstrated strong cash flow from operations, with operating cash flow of 116% of adjusted net income through nine months of 2017.

The company's geographic revenue distribution also showed promising growth, with revenue increasing 9% in the U.S. and 27% in Europe. Despite weakness in the Middle East region, the company saw a 4% increase in revenue to the U.S. government, which accounted for 25% of total revenue.

The company's segments, including surveillance, detection, instruments, OEM and emerging, security, and maritime, all showed revenue and operating income growth, demonstrating a broad-based strength across the business. The company's strong financial position also allows for continued acquisitive activity, with plans to rebuild the pipeline for M&A and maintain investment-grade credit rating.

Overall, the company's strong financial performance, geographic growth, and diversified segment performance make it an attractive investment opportunity. Based on the recent earnings call, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company, as it shows potential for continued growth and strategic acquisitions.
