. Yes, I mean, we've seen fantastic response from the retailers around STAR WARS: The Last Jedi merchandise and as we get closer to the launch date of the film, consumer interest is building. We're very encouraged about the sustained level of business that the STAR WARS franchise has created with its multi-year entertainment slate. As Brian mentioned earlier, this is creating a larger, more sustainable level of business for this top industry property. In terms of our long-term outlook, I would say we're very optimistic about the future potential for the franchise. Thank you. Overall, our Q3 performance was very strong, with significant revenue and earnings growth across all operating segments. Franchise Brands, Hasbro Gaming, and Emerging Brands saw strong revenue growth, led by successful products such as NERF, TRANSFORMERS, MY LITTLE PONY, MONOPOLY, and BABY ALIVE. The impact of the Toys "R" Us bankruptcy and ongoing economic conditions in certain countries may pose challenges for our Q4 revenue growth, but we remain confident in our long-term growth prospects. Our expansive retail channel strategy and strong consumer engagement give us confidence that we can deliver industry-leading growth in the coming years. Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to continuing our strong performance in the future.
