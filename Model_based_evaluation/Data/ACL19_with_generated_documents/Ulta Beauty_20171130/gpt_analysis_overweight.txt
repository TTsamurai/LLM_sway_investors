The company reported an 18.6% growth in the top line and 10.3% comps in the third quarter, which represents an acceleration in a two-year stack compared to the second quarter.

The company showed healthy performance in categories such as skincare, fragrance, and hair care, even though makeup growth moderated. The makeup growth, although softer compared to the previous year, remains healthy, and the company is actively engaging in strategies to boost its CRM and promotional activity.

Additionally, Ulta Beauty's loyalty program continues to drive significant benefits, with well over 90% of sales being captured through the program. The company also made progress in increasing adoption of its credit card launch and saw growth in third-party distribution of gift cards. Ulta Beauty's extensive marketing programs, partnerships, and brand awareness initiatives have contributed to all-time high results in brand awareness metrics.

The company has also been active in expanding its brand partnerships, driving rapid market share gains, accelerating gains in prestige beauty, and adding 320 basis points of market share in prestige beauty overall. Furthermore, Ulta Beauty's e-commerce sales grew 62.9%, and the company enhanced its e-commerce capabilities, site experience, and delivery capabilities.

Looking ahead, Ulta Beauty remains optimistic about the future, with plans to add new brands in every major category, including makeup, skincare, and hair care. The company's store fleet continues to perform well, and it is on track to open another 100 stores in 2018. Ulta Beauty is also focused on leveraging its omni-channel capabilities and has seen growth in mobile app traffic and the number of omni-channel shoppers.

Based on these key insights and financial metrics, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for Ulta Beauty considering the strong performance, robust growth strategies, and the company's ability to adapt to changing industry dynamics. The company's diverse product offerings, innovative marketing initiatives, and continued expansion plans position it well for future success in the beauty industry.
