Financial Metrics:
- 18.6% top-line growth and 10.3% comp sales growth
- GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.70, growing 21.4%
- E-commerce sales representing nearly 9% of total company revenue
- Mobile app traffic increasing more than 300%
- 48 new stores opened in the third quarter, with plans for another 100 stores in 2018
- Skincare and fragrance showed high sales growth and share gains
- $1.8 million new loyalty members gained in the quarter
- Inventory per door grew by 6.5%, well below the total sales comp of 10.3% in the third quarter

Based on the company's focus on expanding their loyalty program and omni-channel capabilities, as well as their strategic initiatives to drive growth in skincare and fragrance, an 'underweight' investment stance might be appropriate due to the potential impact of hurricane disruption and softer makeup trends on future financial performance.
