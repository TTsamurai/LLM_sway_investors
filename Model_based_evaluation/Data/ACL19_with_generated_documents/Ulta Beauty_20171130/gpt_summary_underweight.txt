Based on the earnings conference call transcript, Ulta Beauty demonstrates strength in its business model, delivering double-digit comp despite disruptions from hurricanes. However, taking an 'underweight' investment stance, it is important to focus on key financial metrics to assess the company's performance.

The company saw strong revenue growth of 18.6% and healthy comp growth of 10.3% in the third quarter. However, the impact of hurricanes and softening growth in makeup category should be a concern. Gross margins contracted more than initially planned due to new store and boutique activity, and marketing activities pushed back from the first quarter, leading to margin pressure.

Additionally, the company highlighted significant share gains and rapid loyalty program growth, with Ultamate Rewards program reaching 26.4 million active members, up 21% year-over-year. Retention rates, sales per member, frequency of purchase, and average member ticket also remained healthy and stable.

The salon sales grew 10.8% and comps by 3.8%, although there was regional variation in growth rates due to disruptions from the hurricanes in Florida and Texas. The company is in the early stages of testing an improved salon business model in two markets and is encouraged by the early indicators.

E-commerce sales grew by 62.9%, representing nearly 9% of total company revenue, demonstrating rapid growth and enhanced guest experience. The company's omni-channel capabilities have also resulted in increased engagement among customers purchasing both in-store and online.

In terms of new store openings, Ulta Beauty opened 48 stores in the third quarter and is on track to open another 100 stores in 2018. The company's e-commerce business continues to grow, and there are no immediate plans to change the targeted range for store openings.

Overall, while Ulta Beauty continues to demonstrate strength in its business model, the impact of the hurricanes, softening growth in certain categories, and margin pressure should be considered when adopting an 'underweight' investment stance. It is essential to closely monitor the company's financial performance and strategic initiatives in the coming quarters.
