As a financial analyst evaluating the future outlook for Ralph Lauren, the adoption of an 'underweight' investment stance is driven by several factors arising from the company's recent earnings conference call. Here’s how various factors culminate into this recommendation:

1. **Revenue and Sales Decline**: Despite efforts to improve quality of sales, Ralph Lauren is experiencing notable revenue decreases (-9% reported), including a -16% dip in North American revenue and flat European growth in constant currency. These declines are influenced by strategic brand exits, quality-of-sales initiatives, and challenging consumer demand, especially in wholesale channels.

2. **Profitability Pressures**: Although there has been improvement in adjusted operating margins (up 13.4%), the company's drop in top-line revenues signals potential pressure on profitability. They are likely to face ongoing challenges as they continue their quality-of-sales transformation, which, while enhancing gross margin, might impact overall sales volume negatively.

3. **Overdependence on Discount Reductions and Channel Mix**: A significant part of the margin improvement comes from reduced promotional activities and favorable geographic and channel mix, which might not be sustainable long-term strategies if overall consumer demand does not improve.

4. **Inventory and Cash Flow**: A 26% reduction in inventory is indicative of effective prior restructuring, yet such drastic reductions could also reflect weaker demand or cautious buying strategies, potentially limiting revenue capabilities if not aligned perfectly with demand trends.

5. **Shifting Operational Focus and Increased Expenses**: The pivot to closing unprofitable stores, reducing SKU complexities, and increasing marketing and digital investments will require careful management to avoid escalating operating costs without guaranteed proportional revenue growth, especially noted with the expected increase in SG&A expenses in future quarters.

6. **Strategic Risks in Digital and Global Expansion**: The shift to a new cloud-based e-commerce platform poses execution risk and the necessity of additional capital. Furthermore, concerted expansion efforts in Asia, though promising, carry significant execution and market risk.

7. **Capital Expenditure and Shareholder Returns**: With predicted capital expenditures of $225 million focused on consumer-facing initiatives and no planned share repurchases in fiscal 2018, there is a clear move towards reinvestment in the business rather than direct return to shareholders in the short term.

8. **Guidance and Forward Outlook**: The company’s own guidance suggests further revenue declines and uncertain quarterly performances, affecting investor confidence. Particularly, forecasts of continued revenue suppression in the short term, aligned with restructuring charges, underscore prevailing business risks.

Given this analysis, our 'underweight' stance is motivated by current revenue declines in crucial markets, operational transition risks, the heavy reliance on margin improvements through cost-cutting, and strategic shifts which, while potentially beneficial in the long term, pose substantial short to medium-term financial challenges. Therefore, investors are advised to maintain a cautious approach regarding Ralph Lauren's equities until more robust growth signals and successful execution of strategic initiatives materialize.
