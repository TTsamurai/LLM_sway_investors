Our second quarter results demonstrated strong progress in resetting the business to a healthier base, with improvements in quality of sales, gross margins, and free cash flow. Despite challenges from the impact of hurricanes, our teams showed swift and tireless actions to ensure employee safety and support impacted communities. Our second quarter revenues declined 9% on a reported and constant currency basis, but we exceeded high-end guidance. Adjusted operating margin increased by 100 basis points on a reported basis and by 70 points in constant currency. Gross margin increased by 300 basis points to last year and by 290 basis points in constant currency, driven by reduced promotional activity and favorable geographic and channel mix. Operating expenses were down 5% to last year, driven by cost structure rightsizing and process optimization. In North America, we are executing plans to return to profitable growth, with substantial progress on quality-of-sales initiatives. In Europe, despite revenue being relatively flat with prior year in constant currency, our teams delivered adjusted operating profit growth with margins up 350 basis points to last year. In Asia, revenue was flat to last year on a reported basis and up 4% in constant currency, with positive comps and strong quality-of-sales initiatives. We continue to focus on improving our retail network through closures of underperforming locations and opening new stores with improved adjacencies. Our balance sheet is significantly stronger than last year, with inventory declining 26% and cash and investments increasing to $1.7 billion. Moving forward, we are maintaining our guidance for fiscal 2018 and raising the low end of our operating margin guidance. Our constant currency revenue guidance for fiscal 2018 expects revenues to decline 8% to 9%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. We also expect an increase in gross margin expansion in the second half and a shift in the fourth quarter to ease clearance sales volumes, offsetting some benefits from the Easter shift. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating and will continue to focus on investing in our business and returning capital to shareholders. We are not planning share repurchases for fiscal 2018 and have shifted capital investments behind consumer-facing initiatives that have proven to be successful. Our priorities for cash and capital structure remain focused on maintaining strategic flexibility, liquidity, and access to the capital markets, and we remain confident in our position to drive value for all stakeholders. With strong operational efficiencies, a stable brand, and a strengthened balance sheet, we are well-positioned for future profitable growth. We are confident in our ability to leverage opportunities for growth in Asia and other regions, and we are committed to investing in marketing, product, and store expansions to drive value for our shareholders. Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to your questions.
