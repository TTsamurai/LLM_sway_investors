 to shift the trend as we move into the next fiscal year. And I think that's it for questions. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today.

Based on the recent earnings call, it is evident that the company is facing significant challenges, particularly with a 9% decline in second quarter revenues. The company is also experiencing comp declines in North America wholesale and digital e-commerce channels. The company has outlined various quality-of-sales initiatives, but it is clear that they are still facing challenging top-line trends, particularly in North America.

In addition, the company's escalated expenses, including a significant increase in marketing spend, will create pressure on operating margins in the upcoming quarters. This, combined with a shift in wholesale shipments and a reduction in clearance inventory, will continue to impact revenue and operating margin in the fourth quarter.

While the company's operations in Asia and Europe are showing positive signs, particularly in the growth of adjusted operating margin and revenue in constant currency, it is evident that they are still relying heavily on these regions to offset the challenges faced in North America.

Given the uncertainties surrounding the company's ability to return to growth, their ongoing investments and the significant pressure on their operating margins, it is advisable for investors to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. The company's challenges in revenue and operating margins, combined with their ongoing restructuring charges, suggest that caution is warranted when considering an investment in this stock.
