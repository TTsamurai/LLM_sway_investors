- **Label and Graphic Materials (LGM)**: This core segment displayed robust growth with sales increasing by approx. 7% organically in Q4 and operating margin improving by 70 basis points to 11.5%. The segment is expected to continue its growth trajectory supported by volume increase and steady demand across key markets.

The improved operating margin of 10% in Q4 and outlook for continued margin enhancement position this segment as a strong contributor to profitability.

The projected improvements in both top-line revenues and bottom-line profitability, coupled with steady cash flow generation and shareholder returns, support the 'overweight' investment stance.
