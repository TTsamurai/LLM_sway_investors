Based on the recent earnings call, the company has shown solid performance and growth in the fourth quarter and throughout 2016. The adjusted earnings per share increased by 17% compared to the prior year, driven by higher than expected organic sales growth of approximately 5%. Acquisitions also lifted sales by 2.7%, while adjusted operating margin improved by 70 basis points to 9.4%.

The company is committed to the disciplined return of cash to shareholders, having repurchased 3.8 million shares in 2016 at a cost net of proceeds from stock options of $191 million and paid $143 million in dividends.

Looking ahead to 2017, the company anticipates adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.50, with between 3% and 4.5% organic sales growth. The impact of acquisition on sales is approximately 1.5% from closed deals and approximately 2% including the impact of the announced Hanita deal. The company also estimates that incremental pretax savings from restructuring actions will contribute between $40 million and $50 million in 2017.

The overall outlook for the company is positive, with strong growth in label and graphic materials, retail branding and information solutions, and an expectation for the industrial and healthcare materials segment to return to growth in the second half of 2017.

Overall, the company's solid and consistent free cash flow and healthy balance sheet give them plenty of room to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders, reflecting the company's commitment to delivering exceptional value over the long run.

Based on this strong performance and positive outlook, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended for the company.
