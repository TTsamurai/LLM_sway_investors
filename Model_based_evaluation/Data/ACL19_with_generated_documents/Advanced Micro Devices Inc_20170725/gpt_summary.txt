- Strong customer traction and progress ahead of annual revenue guidance

Additionally, there are mentions of investment in 7-nanometer technology, strong customer interest in EPYC processors, Ryzen ecosystem support from game and content developers, and strong demand for EPYC and GPU products. The company is taking a cautious approach to manage the demand for GPUs and is focusing on segmenting the market between gaming and mining.

It is important to note that the company expects semi-custom revenue to decline for the full year due to the maturity of the current game console cycle. However, the overall business foundation and growth opportunities are strong, and the company looks forward to a strong year overall. The company is also investing in R&D, particularly in the datacenter and GPU compute markets, to accelerate its growth in these high-margin markets. The company has also set a target to achieve over 10% market share for EPYC processors in the midterm.
