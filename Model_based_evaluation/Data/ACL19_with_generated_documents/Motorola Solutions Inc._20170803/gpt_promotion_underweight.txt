Our cautious perspective on the company is due to the following reasons:

1. Operating margins were down, primarily driven by increased system sales and inefficiencies associated with implementing the new ERP system during the quarter. This indicates potential challenges in efficiently managing operations and implementing new systems.

2. Services operating income was down, primarily due to Airwave. While the company expects full-year Services gross margins to be comparable to last year, the decline in operating margin raises concerns about profitability in this segment.

3. Q2 operating cash flow and free cash flow saw a decrease compared to last year, primarily due to working capital timing associated with the ERP implementation. This suggests potential cash flow management issues related to the implementation process.

4. The company's debt level is high, with net debt of $3.7 billion. This indicates potential financial risk and increased interest expense that could affect the company's financial stability.

5. While the company announced an intent to acquire the Airbus PlantCML business, the impact of this acquisition on the company's financials and operations is uncertain and could pose risks to investors.

Given these concerns, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company's stock until there is more clarity on the impact of the challenges mentioned above and the successful integration of the potential acquisition.
