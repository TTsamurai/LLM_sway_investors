Products segment operating income was $193 million, representing 22.8% of sales, which was an increase of 80 basis points from last year.

Services operating income was $135 million or 20.8% of sales, down from 23.5% of sales last year.

Cash flow decreased due to working capital timing associated with ERP implementation. However, cash flow for the full year is expected to be approximately $1.225 billion.

The company repurchased $80 million of stock at an average price of $83.59 during the quarter and paid $77 million in dividends. They also announced their intent to acquire the Airbus PlantCML business. Additionally, they signed the FirstNet partnership agreement with AT&T, with all states that have made a decision opting into the plan network, and AT&T certifying their LEX F10 FirstNet device.

In conclusion, the company's strong Q2 results, favorable outlook, and strategic partnerships suggest potential for future growth. Therefore, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance in the company.
