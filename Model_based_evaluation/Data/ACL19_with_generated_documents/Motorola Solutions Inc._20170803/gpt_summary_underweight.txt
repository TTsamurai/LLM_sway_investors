Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, there are several key financial metrics that indicate a mixed performance for the company. The overall revenue for Q2 was $1.5 billion, which represents a 5% increase compared to last year. GAAP operating earnings were up 15% to $257 million, and non-GAAP operating earnings increased to $328 million. Operating margins decreased by 80 basis points to 21.9%. GAAP earnings per share increased by 28% to $0.78, while non-GAAP EPS increased by 9% to $1.12. 

The ending backlog was $8.5 billion, up $265 million from last year. Products backlog increased by $204 million, and Services backlog increased by $61 million, with aged backlog for the remainder of the year higher than the previous year. 

In terms of regional performance, Americas revenue grew by 7%, driven by strong demand for P25 Products and Services. EMEA experienced a 1% revenue decrease due to currency headwinds, while Products increased by 12%. Asia Pac revenue grew by 2%, primarily due to P25 product demand in Australia.

Looking at the future outlook, the company expects Q3 sales to increase by 3-4%, with non-GAAP EPS between $1.36 and $1.41. For the full year, revenue growth is expected to be 3-4%, with non-GAAP EPS of $5.20 to $5.30.

However, there are areas of concern. The Services operating margin decreased to 20.8% of sales, down from 23.5% last year, primarily due to Airwave. Operating cash flow also decreased by $190 million from last year, mainly due to working capital timing associated with the ERP implementation.

Additionally, gross margins were affected by several factors such as Airwave foreign exchange, purchase accounting adjustments, and ERP implementation costs. Despite these challenges, the company still expects full-year gross margins to be comparable to last year.

Considering the mixed performance and challenges faced in the current quarter, as a financial analyst, it is advisable to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company until there is a clearer improvement in key financial metrics.
