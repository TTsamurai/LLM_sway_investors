Dear Valued Investor,

As we critically review the progress and strategic developments of Duke Energy, reflected in their recent earnings call, it is clear that the company continues to exhibit strong operational and financial resilience, not only maintaining but also advancing on several fronts despite significant challenges such as Hurricane Irma. This report underscores why we are advocating an 'overweight' stance on Duke Energy shares, as detailed below:

**1. Robust Q3 Earnings and Adjusted EPS Uptick:**
Duke Energy reported a solid adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.59 for the third quarter, demonstrating a consistent upward trajectory in profitability. The company expects to achieve year-end earnings within the targeted range of $4.50 to $4.60 per share, despite experiencing adverse weather conditions including revenue impacts from Hurricane Irma.

**2. Operational Excellence During Crisis:**
The response to Hurricane Irma was exemplary, highlighting Duke Energy's robust crisis management capabilities. The rapid restoration of power to the vast majority of affected customers minimized long-term negative impacts and showcased the company's dedication to service and operational excellence.

**3. Strategic Investments and Growth Prospects:**
Duke Energyâ€™s ongoing investments in grid modernization, clean energy generation, and expanding natural gas infrastructure are pivotal. Notably, the Power/Forward Carolinas initiative and investments in utility-scale battery storage underscore a forward-looking approach aimed at boosting energy reliability and sustainability. These projects align with Duke's long-term growth forecast of 4% to 6% annually, promising gradual yet substantial value growth.

**4. Regulatory and Stakeholder Engagement:**
Recent regulatory advancements, including the approval of settlement agreements in Florida, facilitate predictable revenue streams through 2021. These agreements support up to 700 megawatts of solar energy investments and reinforce grid enhancements, setting a robust stage for continuous growth and financial stability.

**5. Recognition and Industry Standing:**
Duke Energy's inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the 12th consecutive year and its acknowledgment by Site Selection Magazine accentuate its commitment to sustainable practices and economic development, enhancing its industry reputation and investor trust.

**6. Financial Stability and Commitment to Shareholders:**
The company's strategic financial management, as evidenced by its handling of Hurricane Irma's cost impacts and its effective cost control measures, solidifies its robust financial posture. Duke Energy remains committed to delivering shareholder value and maintaining a stable dividend payout, reflective of its steady earnings and optimistic future earnings potential.

**Conclusion:**
Duke Energy stands as a resilient, progressive, and strategically-adept utility that is well-positioned to navigate both current challenges and future opportunities. With a focus on sustainable growth, operational excellence, and strategic investments, Duke Energy is poised for a promising future. We recommend investors to adopt an 'overweight' position on Duke Energy, anticipating capital appreciation and robust dividend returns as the company advances through its clearly defined path of strategic investments and stakeholder engagement.
