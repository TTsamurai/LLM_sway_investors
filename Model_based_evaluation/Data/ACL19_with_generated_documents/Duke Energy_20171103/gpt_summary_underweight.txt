The company has reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.59 for the third quarter and is narrowing their 2017 guidance range to $4.50 to $4.60 per share. The company's long-term strategic investment plan is showing growth in the fundamentals of the business. However, the company experienced below-normal weather year-to-date, including lost revenues from Hurricane Irma, resulting in an impact on their financial performance.

The company's response to Hurricane Irma was commendable as they utilized their resources to restore power to customers in just three days and 99% within eight days, despite incurring an initial storm restoration cost estimate of almost $500 million. The majority of this will be recovered through existing Commission storm rules or transmission tariffs.

The company's regulatory calendar is busy, with constructive agreements reached in Florida that pave the way for a smarter energy future for their customers. The settlement provides rate clarity through 2021 and allows recovery of investments in solar energy and grid improvements.

The company is also making significant investments in grid infrastructure and renewable energy, indicating an ongoing commitment to modernizing the energy grid and generating cleaner energy.

There are also ongoing discussions with stakeholders and potential settlement negotiations related to the recovery of coal ash and other environmental compliance costs. The company's financial results were impacted by weak wind resources in 2017, resulting in variability in their financial performance.

Overall, while the company's long-term growth profile remains unchanged at 4% to 6%, the impact of below-normal weather and ongoing regulatory challenges indicate a level of risk and uncertainty that supports an 'underweight' investment stance. It is essential to monitor the company's ability to recover costs and continue delivering on their commitments to customers, communities, and investors.
