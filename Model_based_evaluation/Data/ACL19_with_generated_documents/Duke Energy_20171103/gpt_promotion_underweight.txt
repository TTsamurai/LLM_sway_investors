Based on the company's recent earnings call, there are several factors that lead us to recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on Duke Energy. The company announced adjusted earnings per share of $1.59 for the third quarter, but this growth was due to operational excellence and investments in the long-term strategic plan. The company also mentioned narrowed guidance for 2017 to $4.50 to $4.60 per share, which shows a conservative approach to future earnings. Additionally, the company is facing significant storm restoration costs in Florida, with an estimated $500 million in storm impact and reserve replenishment costs. This will likely impact customer bills, with an expected $5 increase per month for a typical residential bill over a three-year recovery period. Furthermore, the company's regulatory calendar is busy, with ongoing rate cases in Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina, which may lead to increased costs for the company. The company's strategic priorities to modernize the energy grid and expand natural gas infrastructure also represent significant capital expenditures. Finally, the company's evaluation of tax reform and its potential impact on the industry, coupled with the need for clarification and further engagement with industry stakeholders, adds another layer of uncertainty. Overall, the company's recent earnings call and future outlook point to potential challenges and increased costs that may impact shareholder returns. Therefore, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on Duke Energy based on these factors.
