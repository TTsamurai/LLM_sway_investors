Revenue from High-Speed Internet increased by 10.1% to $3.6 billion, driven by an increase in the residential customer base and rate adjustments. Video revenue increased by 4.3% to $5.8 billion, primarily due to rate adjustments and an increase in the residential customer base. However, voice revenue declined by 3.6% to $863 million due to a modest decline in average revenue per user (ARPU) and a loss of 27,000 net residential customers.

On the NBCUniversal side, revenue increased by 14.7% and EBITDA increased by 24.4% in the first quarter. Cable Networks saw a 7.6% revenue increase and a 16.8% increase in EBITDA to $1.1 billion.
