The company has shown strong financial results and growth, but the investor should adopt an 'underweight' stance due to potential concerns about increasing programming expenses and the decline in Cable Advertising revenue. Additionally, the increase in capital expenditures and the acquisition of Universal Studios Japan for $2.3 billion may indicate potential financial strain on the company in the near future.
