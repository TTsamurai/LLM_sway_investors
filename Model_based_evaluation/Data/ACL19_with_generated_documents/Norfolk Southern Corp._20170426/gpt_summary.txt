. In summary, Norfolk Southern reported strong first quarter revenue of $2.6 billion, a 6% year-over-year increase, driven by volume growth of 5% and a revenue per unit improvement of 1%. Gains were seen in all three major market groups, particularly in coal, intermodal, and steel. The company maintained focus on pricing, resulting in flat revenue per unit excluding fuel. Merchandise revenue was up 2%, primarily driven by metals and construction strength. Intermodal revenue increased by 9% with a 4% gain in volume and a 5% improvement in RPU. Coal revenue increased by 20% due to volume increases in the export and utility markets.

Looking ahead, the company is forecasting generally improved economic conditions, particularly related to manufacturing and consumer spending, which is expected to positively impact volume. Crude oil shipments are predicted to decline close to 30% in 2017, and a projected 3.5% decline in U.S. vehicle production will negatively impact automotive volume. However, metals and construction, grain, and plastics are expected to be up year-over-year. Within Intermodal, the company anticipates positive macroeconomic trends to drive organic growth. Year-over-year growth is expected within the coal markets, with export gains driven by the continued tightening of international supply.

The company has a strong focus on adding high-quality revenue that complements its existing network and is leveraging a service product conducive to attracting new revenue. They are also focused on securing pricing in excess of rail inflation and taking a long-term view of their markets and pricing to yield sustainable shareholder value.

In conclusion, Norfolk Southern is optimistic about its ability to continue driving high-quality revenue that complements its network at low incremental costs, ultimately driving shareholder value. The company is focused on achieving price and volume in a difficult truck environment and is confident in its ability to continue to compete with trucking and provide a better service product to its customers.
