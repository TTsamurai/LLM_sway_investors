. We can capitalize on capturing truck volume, and we have a very good customer-focused service product. Our RPU and equipment utilization were both solid on the export side. We felt good about our volume growth against the backdrop of competitive pressure from truck. So, we achieved results and prices that were consistent against last year and should continue that â€“ see that trend into the future. In sum, our key financial metrics for the first quarter of 2017 show a strong 6% year-over-year increase in revenue, driven by volume growth of 5% and a revenue per unit improvement of 1%. Our Merchandise revenue was up 2% with a 1% increase in volume and overall revenue per unit growth of 2%. Intermodal revenue saw a 9% increase over first quarter 2016 with a 4% gain in volume and a 5% improvement in RPU. Coal revenue increased 20% to $420 million in the first quarter. We expect growth within our coal markets this year, and remain confident in our quarterly guidance range of 17 million tons to 19 million tons. With positive macroeconomic trends driving organic growth, we anticipate potential volume growth through the remaining quarters this year. We are confident in our ability to continue to drive high-quality revenue and pricing, ultimately driving shareholder value. Therefore, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance with Norfolk Southern.
