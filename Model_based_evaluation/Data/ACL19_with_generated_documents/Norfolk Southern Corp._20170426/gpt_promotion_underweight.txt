As a stock promoter, it is important to approach this report from a cautious and skeptical perspective based on the recent earnings call from Norfolk Southern. While the company reported strong revenue and volume growth in the first quarter of 2017, there are several factors that raise concerns about the sustainability of this performance.

First, the company's revenue and volume gains were primarily driven by the coal, intermodal, and steel markets. However, there are potential headwinds in these markets, such as reduced energy shipments, truck competition, and decreased U.S. light vehicle production. These factors could impact future volume and revenue growth in these segments.

Additionally, the company's guidance for the year ahead suggests that merchandise volume is expected to be relatively flat in 2017, with declines projected in the crude oil and automotive markets. While there are expected increases in other markets like metals and construction, the overall outlook for volume growth is uncertain.

Furthermore, the company's dependence on coal revenue raises concerns, as it is subject to market volatility and external factors such as natural gas prices and weather conditions. While the recent increase in export coal demand following Cyclone Debbie may provide a short-term benefit, the long-term sustainability of this growth remains uncertain.

The potential tightening of trucking capacity in the latter part of the year is mentioned as a factor that could drive volume growth, but there are no guarantees that this will materialize as expected. The company's ability to convert service-sensitive volume from the highway to intermodal also depends on the trucking environment, which may not fully align with analysts' expectations.

Furthermore, while the company claims to be achieving price increases in a difficult truck environment, there is uncertainty about the sustainability of these price gains. The company's long-term approach to pricing and value of service may face challenges in the face of ongoing truck competition and market volatility.

In conclusion, based on the company's recent earnings call and guidance for the future, there are concerns about the sustainability of Norfolk Southern's revenue and volume growth. Market headwinds, uncertainties in key segments, and potential challenges in achieving sustainable price increases warrant a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company's investment stance. Therefore, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on Norfolk Southern at this time.
