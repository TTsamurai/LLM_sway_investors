. We can make that work with fewer cars, and that also allows us to take trucks off the highway. And yes, Alan, our approach to working with customers on service-sensitive metrics and improving our equipment strategy allows us to provide a more flexible, cost-effective, and reliable service product to our customers. Our collaborative efforts with customers have resulted in improvements in the value we provide to them, and we continue to focus on driving high-quality revenue that complements our existing network while achieving pricing in excess of rail inflation. Even with potential challenges in the trucking environment, we are confident in our ability to drive sustainable shareholder value through our long-term approach to pricing and service provision. Based on the insights from the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that Norfolk Southern has had a strong first quarter performance, with revenue growth in all major market groups, particularly in coal, intermodal, and steel. However, despite the positive performance, there are several factors that may warrant an 'underweight' investment stance.

The first factor to consider is the anticipated decline in crude oil shipments, which is projected to decrease close to 30% in 2017. Additionally, there is an expected 3.5% decline in U.S. vehicle production, which will negatively impact automotive volume. These declines in key markets could potentially impact future revenue growth for the company.

Furthermore, while Norfolk Southern expects improved economic conditions and positive macroeconomic trends to drive organic growth, there are potential challenges in the trucking environment that may limit the upside to pricing. The company acknowledges the pressure in the trucking industry and the need to leverage their service product to take trucks off the highway. This indicates potential competitive pressures in the future, which could impact the company's ability to achieve pricing in excess of rail inflation.

Additionally, the volatility in the coal market, particularly in seaborne prices and utility coal stockpiles, poses a risk to the company's coal revenue. While Norfolk Southern anticipates year-over-year growth within their coal markets, the market conditions, including natural gas prices, weather, and electricity demand, will significantly impact the company's coal volume and revenue.

Overall, while Norfolk Southern has demonstrated strong performance and strategic initiatives to drive high-quality revenue, the potential decline in key markets, competitive pressures in the trucking industry, and volatility in the coal market justify an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. It is essential for potential investors to carefully consider these factors and their potential impact on Norfolk Southern's future financial performance.
