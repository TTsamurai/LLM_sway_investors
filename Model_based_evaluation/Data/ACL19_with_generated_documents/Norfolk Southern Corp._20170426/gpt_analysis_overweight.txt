Based on the insights and financial metrics derived from the recent earnings conference call, Norfolk Southern has shown strong revenue growth and volume gains in all three major market groups, particularly in coal, intermodal, and steel. The company also experienced an increase in fuel surcharge revenues due to higher on-highway diesel prices. Merchandise, intermodal, and coal markets all showed improvement in revenue and volume, with particular strength in metals, construction, and export coal.

The company is forecasting improved economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and consumer spending, which is expected to positively impact volume. The growth in merchandise volume is expected to be relatively flat in 2017, with lower crude oil shipments and decreased vehicle production being offset by gains in metals, construction, grain, and plastics. Intermodal volume is expected to continue to grow due to the company's strong service product and the tightening truck capacity in the latter part of the year. The coal market is also expected to experience year-over-year growth, with export gains driven by tightening international supply and increased demand and pricing for U.S. export coal.

Norfolk Southern is focusing on securing high-quality revenue growth that complements its existing network and has developed a service product conducive to attracting new revenue. The company is also focused on continuing initiatives to attain pricing in excess of rail inflation, taking a long-term view of its markets and pricing to yield sustainable shareholder value.

The company's operational performance and equipment strategy are also driving improvements in customer-specific service metrics, which are unique to the markets and demands of individual customers. Norfolk Southern's efforts to go to a more homogenized fleet not only benefit operations but also improve its ability to compete with trucks and provide a better service product to customers.

In conclusion, based on the company's strong revenue growth, volume gains, and strategic focus on securing high-quality revenue growth and attaining pricing in excess of rail inflation, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended for Norfolk Southern.
