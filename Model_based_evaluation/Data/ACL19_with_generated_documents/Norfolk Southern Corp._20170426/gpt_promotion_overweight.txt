. Additionally, a projected 3.5% decline in 2017 U.S. vehicle production will negatively impact our automotive volume. However, metals and construction, grain, and plastics are expected to be up year-over-year within our Merchandise market.

Based on the company's recent earnings call, Norfolk Southern has demonstrated solid revenue growth in the first quarter of 2017. With a 6% year-over-year increase in revenue, driven by volume growth in all major market groups, the company has shown resilience in the face of challenging market conditions. Specifically, the company's coal market saw a 20% increase in revenue, with significant volume increases in both export and utility markets. This growth was supported by a strong performance in the intermodal market, which saw a 9% revenue increase and a 4% gain in volume.

Looking ahead, Norfolk Southern's focus on executing a strategic vision for growth is promising. The company expects macroeconomic trends to drive organic growth, particularly in manufacturing and consumer spending. While certain markets may face challenges, such as the decline in U.S. vehicle production, Norfolk Southern is confident in its ability to drive high-quality revenue that complements its network at low incremental costs.

This outlook is further supported by the company's strong service product, which has allowed Norfolk Southern to convert service-sensitive volume from the highway and attract new revenue. With an emphasis on customer-specific service metrics and a focus on innovation as supply chains evolve, Norfolk Southern is well-positioned to continue improving the value it provides to its customers and drive shareholder value.

It is worth noting that, despite the challenges in certain markets, Norfolk Southern has successfully achieved and expects to continue achieving price and volume growth, even in difficult trucking environments. Additionally, the company's strategic equipment strategy, which aims to create a more homogenized fleet, not only benefits operations but also improves its ability to compete with trucks and provide a better service product to customers.

In conclusion, based on the recent earnings call, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Norfolk Southern. The company's resilient revenue growth, strategic vision for growth, and focus on customer-specific service metrics position it well for sustainable shareholder value and long-term success.
