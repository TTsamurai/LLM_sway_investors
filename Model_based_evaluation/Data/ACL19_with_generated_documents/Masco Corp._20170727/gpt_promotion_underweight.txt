Based on the recent earnings call, the company has reported solid growth in sales and operating profit. However, there are several factors that suggest a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company's performance.

First, while the company reported a 4% increase in North American sales, it is important to note that this was largely driven by repair and remodeling products, which represent approximately 83% of total sales. This concentration in a single segment of the market may pose a risk to the company's revenue stream.

Additionally, the company experienced a slight increase in SG&A as a percent of sales, partly due to strategic growth investments. This suggests that the company may have incurred higher costs in order to drive growth, which could impact profitability in the future.

In the Cabinetry segment, sales declined by 3% due to the exit of certain low-margin builder business in the U.S. and in the U.K. While the company expects to see year-over-year segment sales growth in the third quarter, there are potential risks associated with the impact of new product launches and antidumping duties and countervailing tariffs on imported Chinese plywood.

Furthermore, the sale of the Arrow Fastener business at the end of the second quarter is projected to reduce sales and operating profit in the second half of 2017. This divestiture, along with other program reset costs, may result in additional charges that could affect the company's financial performance.

In conclusion, based on the information from the earnings call, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on the company, as there are potential risks and challenges that could impact its future profitability.
