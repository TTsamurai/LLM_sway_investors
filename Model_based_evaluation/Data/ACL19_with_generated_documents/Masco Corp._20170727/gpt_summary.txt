The recent earnings conference call highlighted several key financial metrics that are important for analysis:

1. Sales Growth: The company reported a 4% increase in sales, excluding the impact of foreign currency. This was driven by strong demand for repair and remodeling products across all distribution channels in North America and international Plumbing businesses.

2. Gross Margin: Gross margins expanded by 60 basis points to 35.8%, mainly due to improvements in the North American Windows business.

3. Operating Income and Margin: Operating income increased by 4% to $357 million with operating margins expanding by 30 basis points to 17.4%, the strongest operating margin in nearly 15 years.

4. EPS Improvement: Earnings per share (EPS) increased by 30% compared to the second quarter of 2016, excluding the impact of a one-time loss on debt extinguishment.

5. Segment Performance: The Plumbing segment delivered outstanding results with a 5% increase in sales, while the Decorative Architectural Products segment grew by 5%. The Cabinetry segment experienced a decline in sales, partly due to the exit of low-margin builder business. The Windows segment reported a 7% increase in sales driven by growth in the Milgard business.

6. Cost Management and Investments: The company made strategic growth investments, resulting in an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) as a percent of sales. Additionally, the company incurred costs related to new product launches and tariffs on imported Chinese plywood.

7. Balance Sheet and Share Repurchase: The company maintained balance sheet liquidity of approximately $1.1 billion and repurchased 1.2 million shares valued at approximately $42 million during the second quarter.

Based on these financial metrics, the company demonstrated positive sales growth and improved operating margins. The impact of strategic growth investments and cost management initiatives should be closely monitored in the context of future financial performance. Additionally, the company's ability to mitigate the impact of tariffs and manage supply chain initiatives will be important for maintaining profitability.
