Based on the recently conducted earnings call, the company has shown consistent growth in both sales and operating profit. The second quarter of 2017 marked the company's 23rd consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales and operating profit growth, with a 4% increase in sales excluding the impact of foreign currency. This growth was driven by strong demand from repair and remodeling products across all channels of distribution and across the price continuum. Additionally, the company reported a 30% improvement in EPS compared to the second quarter of 2016.

The Plumbing segment delivered outstanding results, with a 5% increase in sales driven by growth in faucets, showers, and spas. International sales also increased 5%, with strong double-digit growth in China. In the Decorative Architectural Products segment, an increase of 5% was recorded, driven by strong double-digit growth of the BEHR PRO business and solid performance of BEHR MARQUEE. The Cabinetry segment saw a decline of 3% in sales due to the exit of low-margin builder business in the United States and the UK.

Despite some challenges in certain segments, the company has shown a strong financial performance, particularly in gross margins and operating profit. The balance sheet liquidity remains strong, and the company has initiated actions to create shareholder value by repurchasing shares and refinancing high coupon debt to reduce interest expense.

The company's management has also indicated confidence in their ability to achieve top-line growth and mid-single-digit margins for the second half of 2017. Furthermore, the company has outlined plans to enhance product assortment and mitigate the impact of tariffs on imported Chinese plywood.

Overall, based on the earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on the company, considering its strong financial performance and strategic growth initiatives.
