Based on the information provided in the recent earnings call, there are several factors that suggest a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company and a recommendation for an 'underweight' investment stance.

1. Revenue and ASP: While the company reported an increase in total revenue for the fourth quarter, it is important to note that this increase was affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Additionally, the decrease in Invisalign ASPs reflects higher promotional activity and the impact of foreign exchange rates. This suggests that the revenue growth may not be sustainable in the long term.

2. Operating Expenses: The company reported a significant increase in operating expenses, reflecting continued investment in the go-to-market activity. This increase in expenses may impact the company's profitability in the future.

3. Equity Loss from Smile Direct Club: The company expects the equity loss from its investment in Smile Direct Club to be two to three times the 2016 losses. This indicates a potential risk to the company's financial performance.

4. Impact of Foreign Exchange Rates: The company reported significant impacts from foreign exchange rates, which affected gross margins, operating expenses, and diluted earnings per share. This suggests a level of vulnerability to currency fluctuations.

5. Uncertainty related to Trump's Corporate Tax Rate: The company acknowledged the potential impact of President Trump's comments and the proposed reduction of the corporate tax rate. This uncertainty may create additional risks for the company's financial outlook.

In conclusion, based on the information provided in the earnings call, there are several factors that raise concerns about the company's financial performance and growth prospects. These factors suggest a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company and a recommendation for an 'underweight' investment stance.
