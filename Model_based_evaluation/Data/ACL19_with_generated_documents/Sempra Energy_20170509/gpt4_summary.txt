**Sempra Earnings Call Summary for Q1 2017**

**Key Financial Metrics:**
1. **Quarterly Earnings and Comparatives:**
   - Q1 2017 earnings were reported at $441 million, or $1.75 per share.
   - This reflects a significant increase compared to Q1 2016's earnings of $353 million, or $1.40 per share.
   - Adjusted earnings for Q1 2017 were $438 million, or $1.74 per share, compared to adjusted earnings in Q1 2016 of $404 million, or $1.60 per share.

2. **Accounting Adjustments:**
   - The adoption of a new accounting standard on stock-based compensation in Q3 of the previous year increased Q1 2016 earnings by $34 million.

3. **Operational Earnings Highlights:**
   - SDG&E contributed an additional $18 million over the previous year.
   - California Utilities saw a $21 million increase, mainly due to the delayed decision on the 2016 GRC filing.
   - Sempra Mexico reported a $29 million increase due to the GdC and Ventika acquisitions and higher AFUDC earnings.

4. **Tax and Interest Impacts:**
   - An improved tax benefit and reduced interest costs at the Parent resulted in a $14 million earnings increase.
   - However, this was offset by a shift from a $34 million tax benefit in 2016 to a $3 million tax expense in 2017 related to share-based compensation.

5. **Foreign Currency Impacts:**
   - Sempra Mexico observed a $25 million drop due to unfavorable foreign currency and inflation effects.
   - The company's hedging strategy aims to mitigate FX-related exposure on U.S. dollar debt in Mexico, although it does not hedge other FX exposures which historically balance out over the full year.

**Strategic Developments and Capital Projects:**
1. **Major Projects and Capital Plan:**
   - Progress in advancing Cameron's Trains 1-3 and other major pipeline projects.
   - Investment in natural gas pipelines in Mexico with a total investment close to $900 million, backed by 25-year U.S. dollar denominated contracts.

2. **Renewables and Innovation:**
   - Signed contracts for 83.5 Megawatt battery storage facilities.
   - Placed into service one of the largest lithium-ion battery systems.
   - IEnova's agreement to construct a 110 Megawatt solar facility in Mexico costing approximately $115 million.

3. **Future Investments and Opportunities:**
   - Exploring almost $500 million of new capital in additional projects not considered in the initial capital plan.
   - Potential expansions and replacements in utility systems indicating growth and modernization initiatives.

**Market and Contractual Considerations:**
- The impending roll-off of the ENI contract at Cameron by yearâ€™s end is expected to impact future revenues, with $5 million benefit estimated this year and no benefit next year.

**Conclusion and Forward Look:**
Sempra's Q1 2017 represents the strongest Q1 performance since its formation, driven by robust operating results, strategic progress in major and renewable projects, and comprehensive hedging strategies against FX exposure. However, future outlook must account for contractual changes and continued adjustments to tax expenses related to share-based compensation.
