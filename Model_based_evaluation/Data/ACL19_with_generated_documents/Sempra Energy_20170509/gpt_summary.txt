Based on the recent earnings conference call transcripts, the key financial metrics to consider are the following:

- First quarter earnings: The first quarter financial results showed the strongest performance since Sempra was formed, with reported earnings of $441 million or $1.75 per share. This represents a favorable comparison to the first quarter of 2016, which had earnings of $353 million or $1.40 per share. On an adjusted basis, the first quarter 2017 earnings were $438 million or $1.74 per share compared to $404 million or $1.60 per share in the first quarter of 2016.

- Operating results: The higher quarter-over-quarter adjusted earnings were driven by strong operating results, including $18 million of higher operating earnings from SDG&E in South America and $21 million of higher earnings at the California Utilities. Sempra Mexico also saw improvements in earnings, with $29 million of higher earnings related to acquisitions and higher AFUDC earnings.

- Tax benefits and expenses: There were $14 million of higher tax benefits and lower interest costs at the Parent company. However, there were also $34 million of tax benefits in 2016 compared to $3 million of tax expense in 2017 associated with share-based compensation.

- Foreign currency and inflation effects: There were $25 million of lower earnings from foreign currency and inflation effects in Mexico, primarily from current quarter losses. The company's hedging strategy limits FX-related exposure on U.S. dollar debt in Mexico, with the aim of reducing or eliminating expenses related to this exposure over the full year.

- Future outlook: It was mentioned that the ENI contract, one of the original contracting parties at Cameron, will be rolling off at the end of the year. This segment is expected to report roughly $40 million to $50 million of negative results for the year, with the expectation that next year will not have the benefit of that contract.

Overall, the first quarter financial results showed improved earnings and strong operating performance, with a focus on executing capital plans and pursuing new investment opportunities. The key financial metrics to monitor include earnings per share, operating earnings from different segments, tax benefits and expenses, and foreign currency and inflation effects. Additionally, the impact of contracts rolling off and their implications for future financial performance should be noted.
