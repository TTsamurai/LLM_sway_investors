Based on the recent earnings call transcript, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance in the company. The company's first quarter earnings were the strongest since its formation, with $441 million in earnings or $1.75 per share, compared to $353 million or $1.40 per share in the first quarter of 2016. The company also reported $438 million or $1.74 per share in adjusted earnings, compared to $404 million or $1.60 per share in the first quarter of 2016. 

The positive earnings were driven by strong operating results, including higher operating earnings from SDG&E in South America and the California Utilities, as well as higher earnings at Sempra Mexico. The company also reported higher tax benefits and lower interest costs at Parent. Despite some challenges with foreign currency and inflation effects, the company's hedging strategy is designed to reduce or eliminate expenses related to exposure on U.S. dollar debt in Mexico.

Additionally, the company is focused on executing its capital plan by advancing major projects, including the completion of three natural gas pipelines by the end of the second quarter. They have also signed contracts for battery storage facilities and are looking at new investment opportunities, including a solar facility with a 20-year PPA.

Based on these positive financial results and future growth opportunities, I believe an 'overweight' investment stance in the company is warranted. The company's strong performance and strategic investments demonstrate potential for continued growth and profitability in the future.
