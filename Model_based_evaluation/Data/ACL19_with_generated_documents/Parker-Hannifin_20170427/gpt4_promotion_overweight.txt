### Executive Summary

We are pleased to recommend an Overweight investment stance on Parker, following a robust third quarter earnings performance that underscores the company's operational success and strategic forward momentum. This financial quarter has not only demonstrated Parker's resilience and adaptability but also highlighted substantial growth opportunities that assure long-term shareholder value.

### Leadership and Management Stability

Parker's recent leadership transition, with Cathy stepping into the CFO role, has been seamless and is reflective of the company's robust succession planning. Her extensive experience within Parker ensures a continuity of excellence and insight, critical to driving operational efficiencies and financial performance.

### Financial Performance Highlights

1. **Robust Sales Growth:** Parker reported a remarkable 10% increase in sales reaching $3.12 billion, driven by organic growth and strategic acquisitions like CLARCOR.
2. **Significant Increase in Net Income and EPS:** Net income for the quarter rose by 28% to $238.8 million. Adjusted EPS saw a 40% increase, demonstrating strong profit growth.
3. **Strong Margin Performance:** The adjusted segment operating margins grew by 140 basis points, highlighting effective cost management and operational efficiency.

### Strategic Acquisitions

The integration of CLARCOR has been progressing exceptionally well, with expected cost synergies of $140 million reinforcing Parker’s strategic vision and execution capabilities. Additionally, the acquisition of Helac Corporation enhances our hydraulics portfolio, aligning with long-term growth objectives.

### Innovative Offerings and Market Expansion

The launch of the Voice of the Machine IoT platform at the Hannover Messe trade fair is a testament to Parker’s commitment to innovation. This platform enhances customer value through improved safety, reduced downtime, and operational efficiencies.

### Revised Financial Forecast

Reflecting stronger than anticipated performance, Parker has revised its FY 2017 sales growth forecast to a mid-point increase of 5.9% and adjusted EPS to the range of $7.70 to $8.00. These adjustments suggest a robust financial outlook, further solidifying our recommendation for an Overweight investment stance.

### Dividend Consistency and Shareholder Return

Parker’s strategic capital allocation, evidenced by a 5% increase in quarterly dividends and continuous share repurchases, demonstrates its commitment to delivering shareholder returns. This practice has contributed to a historical 61-year consecutive annual dividend increase.

### Conclusion

With a century-long legacy of industrial leadership, Parker's 100th year marks a pivotal moment. The combination of strong Q3 performance, strategic acquisitions, innovative market offerings, and sound financial management reinforce our confidence in Parker's ability to generate significant shareholder value. Thus, we uphold our Overweight stance, anticipating considerable returns fueled by strategic operations, market expansion, and robust financial health.
