Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, we can conclude that Parker had a very strong third quarter, with sales increasing by 10% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Organic sales increased by 6%, and acquisitions contributed 5%, while currency was a negative 1%. This was the first quarter of organic growth since December 2014. Net income for the third quarter increased by 28% compared to the same period last year. Earnings per share were $1.75 as reported or $2.11 on an adjusted basis, a 40% increase in adjusted earnings per share compared with the same quarter last year. 

The overall segment operating margin performance this quarter was very strong at 14.8%, as reported, or 16.1% on an adjusted basis. Adjusted segment operating margins increased 140 basis points compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2016, showing an excellent year-over-year improvement.

The CLARCOR integration process is going well, with a dedicated integration team working on combining the businesses. The company is confident in generating the expected $140 million in cost synergies from the combined filtration businesses. The company has also completed the acquisition of Helac Corporation to add specialty rotary actuators and attachments to their hydraulics portfolio.

As a financial analyst, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Parker based on these strong financial metrics, including the organic sales growth, improved segment operating margins, and successful integration of acquisitions. The company's consistent cash generation and commitment to increasing dividends and buying back shares further support this investment stance. It is also important to note the positive impact of the recent Voice of the Machine Internet of Things offering, indicating the company's focus on innovation and future growth opportunities.
