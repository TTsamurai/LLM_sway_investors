**Investment Stance - ‘Underweight’:**

Despite Thermo Fisher’s strong start to 2017, the ‘underweight’ stance is recommended due to:

- Competitive pressures that could impact long-term growth sustainability across various segments.
- Reliance on continual innovation and successful integration of acquisitions which embeds execution risk.

Investors are advised to maintain cautious optimism, closely monitor strategic execution, and stay abreast of macroeconomic and regulatory changes impacting Thermo Fisher’s core and emerging market segments.
