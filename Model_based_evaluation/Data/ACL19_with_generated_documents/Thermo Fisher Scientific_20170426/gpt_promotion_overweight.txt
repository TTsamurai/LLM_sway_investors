Based on the recent earnings call transcripts, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Thermo Fisher Scientific. The company had a great start to the year with strong financial performance on both the top and bottom line. They experienced double-digit growth in revenue, adjusted EPS, and operating income in Q1. Additionally, the company made strategic investments in innovation, emerging markets, and their customer value proposition. Thermo Fisher also completed two bolt-on acquisitions in bioproduction and digital science, further strengthening their position in high-growth markets. The company's growth strategy based on developing high-impact, innovative products, leveraging their scale in Asia-Pacific, and delivering a unique value proposition has shown promising results. Thermo Fisher also raised their guidance to reflect their strong Q1 performance, a more favorable FX environment, and recent acquisitions. With a positive outlook for their growth strategy, strong financial performance, and strategic investments, Thermo Fisher Scientific is well positioned to deliver another excellent year in 2017.
