Dear colleagues,

I have prepared a summary report on the recent earnings conference call transcripts from Thermo Fisher Scientific. The call highlighted the strong financial performance in the first quarter of the year, with key financial metrics showing excellent growth. Adjusted EPS increased by 16% to $2.08 per share, while revenue grew by 11% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income also increased by 16%, and the adjusted operating margin expanded by 90 basis points to 22.6%. 

The company's performance was strong in the pharma and biotech market, with high single-digit growth. There was also continued growth in the bioproduction business and biosciences products. In academic and government end markets, growth was similar to what was seen in the previous year. In health care and diagnostics, conditions remained unchanged from the previous year, with low-single-digit growth. 

The company's growth strategy focuses on innovation, leveraging scale in Asia-Pacific, and delivering a unique customer value proposition. Significant progress was made in innovation, with new products launched across various technology portfolios. The company also reported strong growth in China, India, and South Korea, leveraging its scale in these emerging markets. 

The company completed two bolt-on acquisitions in bioproduction and digital science, strengthening its offering in high-growth areas. The acquisitions are aligned with the company's growth strategy to develop new digital solutions that support the way customers want to work. 

In terms of financial performance, the company deployed over $1.1 billion of its capital year-to-date, including strategic M&A, stock buybacks, and dividends. The guidance for 2017 has been raised to reflect strong Q1 performance, a more favorable FX environment, and recent acquisitions. Revenue guidance has been raised to a new range of $19.51 billion to $19.71 billion, resulting in 7% to 8% growth over 2016. Adjusted EPS guidance has also been raised to a new range of $9.12 to $9.28 for 2017, reflecting 10% to 12% growth over 2016.

Overall, the company is well-positioned to deliver another excellent year in 2017, with a strong start to the year and confidence in its growth strategy.

Best regards,
