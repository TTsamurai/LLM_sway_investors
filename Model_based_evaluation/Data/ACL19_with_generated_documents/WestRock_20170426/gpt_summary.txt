, analysts and investors. Thank you for joining our call today. I would like to provide a detailed summary report on the recent earnings conference call transcripts from WestRock. The focus will be on key financial metrics.

Firstly, WestRock had a strong quarter and generated $0.54 of adjusted earnings per share. The company executed well and delivered year-over-year productivity improvements of $103 million, primarily offsetting the exceptional increase experienced in input costs. The company's primary goal is to drive improved results and increased value for customers and stockholders over the short and long-term. They provide a comprehensive portfolio of paper and packaging solutions and are successful in integrating products and services to deliver value to customers.

The company has achieved an annual run rate of $675 million in synergies and performance improvements, aiming for a $1 billion goal. They have returned $1.4 billion to stockholders since the merger through dividends and share repurchases.

They have made substantial progress over the past two years focusing their portfolio and growing as a leader in paper and packaging. They have focused on their core business of paper and packaging, completed acquisitions, and exited non-core businesses.

Moving on to the second quarter performance, sales for the quarter were $3.7 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $547 million, with a consolidated margin of 15%. The total commodity inflation was a significant headwind year-over-year, with increases in most input costs, particularly in recovered fiber and natural gas.

The North American corrugated shipments and box shipments per day showed positive trends, with strength in consumer, eCommerce, and select food markets. The company is focused on differentiated strategies and growth in segments and markets to drive value for customers.

The Consumer Packaging team also delivered strong results, with $235 million in adjusted EBITDA and year-over-year improvements. The company's focus has been on implementing price increases across every grade, further strengthening their position in the market.

In terms of productivity improvements, the internalization efforts through the merger have been a significant contributor, along with procurement savings and footprint actions. However, the company anticipates that this quarter will be the peak quarter in terms of productivity on a year-over-year basis, as they start to lap the benefits of internalization efforts.

The company expects to close the acquisition of Multi Packaging Solutions in the June quarter, which will further expand their presence in healthcare and high-end customer markets.

Overall, WestRock remains focused on its goal of becoming a leader in paper and packaging, with strong cash flows, improved margins, and significant opportunities for employees, customers, and investors over the short-term and long-term.

In summary, WestRock's recent earnings conference call highlights their strong performance, focus on cost management, and efforts to drive value for customers and stockholders. Key financial metrics such as sales, EBITDA, productivity improvements, and the upcoming acquisition of Multi Packaging Solutions indicate a positive outlook for the company. Thank you.
