, Martin. I'll let Jeff respond to that. Jeff Chalovich here, Martin. What we showed you was EBITDA that remember when we recorded the held for sale, we did not depreciate. We had lower depreciation in the quarter as normally the D&A in that business was about $3 to $3.5 million a month. So there was also the benefit in the Q2 which we backed out of adjusted EPS held for sale impact on the lower D&A. So the sequential improvement from an EPS point of view would have reflected not only that we don't have the EBITDA contribution but then you don't have that benefit that you have from the lower D&A. EPS is the net of the two. I hope that answers your question. Thank you. Thank you. I'll turn it back to Jeff for closing remarks.

Thank you for your attention today, everyone. We appreciate your continued interest in WestRock and look forward to updating you in the next quarter. Have a great day. Thank you.

Given the positive tone of the recent earnings call, it is clear that WestRock is confident in their position and their ability to continue delivering value to their customers and stockholders. However, it is important to approach this information with caution. Despite the successful execution and strong performance culture highlighted by the company, the significant increases in input costs, such as recovered fiber and natural gas, present a concerning headwind for the company.

Additionally, although the company has achieved impressive productivity improvements and synergies, it is worth noting the potential impact of these improvements reaching their peak in the near future. As the company begins to "lap the benefits" of their internalization efforts, it is uncertain whether they will be able to maintain the same level of productivity growth in the future.

Furthermore, the announced acquisition of Multi Packaging Solutions, while positioning the company to expand their presence in healthcare and high-end customer markets, also presents integration challenges that could impact the company's performance in the short term.

Overall, while WestRock has demonstrated strong performance and strategic growth initiatives, the cautionary factors highlighted in the recent earnings call warrant a skeptical perspective on the company's future outlook. Considering these factors, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on WestRock at this time.
