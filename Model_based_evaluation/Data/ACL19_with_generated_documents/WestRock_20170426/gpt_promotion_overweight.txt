, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. WestRock had a very good quarter. We generated $0.54 of adjusted earnings per share. We executed well and delivered year-over-year productivity improvements of $103 million. Our productivity improvements were a highlight of the quarter and were the primary contributor helping us mostly offset the exceptional increase we experienced in input cost. While these higher input costs may persist, favorable market trends and the relentless execution of our strategy by the WestRock team will drive improved results and increased value for our customers and stockholders over the short and long-term, leading to a recommendation for an 'overweight' investment stance in the company.

WestRock's comprehensive portfolio of paper and packaging solutions is helping customers meet their goals across a range of markets. We showcased some examples of how we're integrating our products and services to deliver value to our customers, including incremental annual sales of more than $150 million from the breadth of our portfolio. Additionally, our track record of execution, with an annual run rate of $675 million in synergies and performance improvements, demonstrates the strong performance culture we are building at WestRock.

We've been successful in our disciplined capital allocation strategy, with significant returns to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our focused portfolio on core paper and packaging business, coupled with acquisitions and developments, such as the acquisition of Multi Packaging Solutions, highlights our commitment to strategic growth and expansion.

In terms of financial performance, our second quarter sales were $3.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA was $547 million, with consolidated margins at 15%. Despite total commodity inflation of $125 million, our corrugated packaging team executed well, and our North American adjusted EBITDA margins were 15.9%. The Consumer Packaging team also operated extremely well, with adjusted EBITDA of $235 million or 15.1% of revenue.

Looking ahead, we are well-positioned to improve margins, grow cash, and help our customers achieve their goals with our comprehensive portfolio and strong execution. This, coupled with our consistent and growing cash flow, gives us the ability to make acquisitions that improve our business and provide opportunities for significant returns to stockholders through increasing dividends and share repurchases.

In summary, WestRock's recent earnings call and performance demonstrate a strong and strategic focus on growth, execution, and value creation for both customers and investors. We recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company based on its performance and outlook for the future. Thank you for your attention.
