Based on the recent earnings call, it is clear that the company is still not meeting its goal of a 50-50 balance in its total portfolio of option and controls. This indicates that the company may be facing challenges in striking option deals and achieving its desired mix. The increase in lot costs as a percentage of revenue or per square foot for current deliveries is also a cause for concern, as it may affect the company's profitability. Additionally, the company's intentional mix away from the west may be a reflection of the challenges and limitations in that market.

The mention of warranty and litigation in the earnings call raises further red flags. The company's expansion into new markets may be leading to increased exposure to warranty and litigation issues, which could create additional financial burdens and potential reputational risks.

In conclusion, the company's recent earnings call suggests ongoing challenges in achieving its desired mix of option and controls, as well as potential risks related to increased lot costs and warranty and litigation issues. As a result, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company until these challenges are addressed and resolved.
