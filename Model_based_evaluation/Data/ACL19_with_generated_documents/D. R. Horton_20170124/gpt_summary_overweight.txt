The conference call transcript features a discussion about the company's progress in shifting towards a higher mix of option and control in their total portfolio. The speaker mentions that while the company has not yet reached its goal of a 50-50 balance, they are pleased with the relationships they have expanded with developers across the country and the increase in finished lots they have been able to tie up and partner with others to develop. This strategy is reflected in the increase in lot costs as a percentage of revenue or per square foot for current deliveries. The company is focused on improving returns and is seeing the benefits of having more lots provided for them to finish, rather than self-developing.

The speaker also discusses the intentional mix away from the west, noting that the focus on shifting towards a balance between option and control is intentional and not just a result of the lower investment in the west, which is more of a cash market. This indicates a strategic shift towards a higher mix of option and control in the company's portfolio.

In terms of housekeeping, the speaker mentions warranty and litigation in the quarter, but provides little detail. It is unclear if these issues are region-specific or more one-time in nature.

From a financial analysis perspective, the focus on increasing the mix of option and control in the company's portfolio is a positive indicator. It suggests a strategic shift towards higher margin products, which could lead to improved returns in the long run. The company's focus on building relationships and partnering with the right people market-by-market also bodes well for future growth and expansion. The intentional mix away from the west also indicates a focus on markets with higher potential for returns, which is in line with an 'overweight' investment stance.

Overall, the company's focus on improving returns through a higher mix of option and control in their portfolio, as well as the strategic shift away from lower potential markets, makes a compelling case for an 'overweight' investment stance.
