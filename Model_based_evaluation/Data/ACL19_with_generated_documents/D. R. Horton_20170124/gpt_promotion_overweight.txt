Based on the recent earnings call, it is evident that the company has made significant progress in pushing towards a 50-50 balance in their total portfolio of option and controls. This is a positive sign as it indicates a strong focus on building relationships with developers and expanding partnerships for the supply of land or lots. The company's strategy to have more lots provided for the Company finish, rather than self-developing as much, is driving improved returns and a stable growth trajectory.

The intentional mix away from the west and the focus on shifting towards a more balanced investment stance is strategically sound. The company's emphasis on building relationships, partnering with the right people, market-by-market, and having the experience and confidence to get projects on the ground and work through them together, is driving positive results for the business.

Regarding the warranty and litigation this quarter, it appears to be a normal course of business as the company has expanded into new markets. There is no indication that these issues are regional or more one-time in nature.

In conclusion, based on the recent earnings call, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The progress made in pushing towards a more balanced portfolio, the focus on building relationships and partnerships, and the overall positive outlook for the business, make it an attractive investment opportunity.
