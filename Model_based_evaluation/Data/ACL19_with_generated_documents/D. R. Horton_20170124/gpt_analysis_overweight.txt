Based on the insights from the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that the company has successfully pushed towards a higher mix of optioned lots in its total portfolio, although it is still not at the goal of a 50-50 balance. The company's strategy of partnering with developers to supply finished lots has driven up lot costs as a percentage of revenue, but it has also led to improved returns. The management highlighted the importance of building relationships and partnering with the right people, market-by-market, to achieve this mix.

The company's intentional mix away from the west, where the market remains more of a cash market, is a reflection of its focus on shifting towards a more balanced portfolio of option and control.

Additionally, there was a mention of warranty and litigation expenses during the quarter, with the management suggesting that these could be a normal course of business as the company expands into new markets. The nature of these expenses was not clearly stated, so it would be important to further investigate the specifics of these costs and their impact on the company's financials.

Overall, the company's focus on expanding relationships with developers, shifting towards a more balanced portfolio, and managing expenses in its expansion into new markets are positive indicators for its future outlook. As a financial analyst, these insights suggest an 'overweight' investment stance for the company. The company's ability to improve returns through its strategic initiatives and its potential for further growth in new markets make it an attractive investment opportunity.
