Based on the recent earnings call, there are several factors that suggest a cautious or skeptical perspective on Anthem Inc. First, while second quarter earnings per share were strong at $3.16, there are indications that the Individual enrollment declined, which impacts the overall membership numbers. Additionally, the company's operating margin for the Commercial business declined by 150 basis points due to less favorable adjustments to prior year risk adjuster accruals, the one year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017, and higher performance-based incentive compensation accruals. This indicates a potential decrease in profitability.

The company also mentioned ongoing uncertainty in the Individual ACA-compliant marketplace, with discussions about largely exiting the marketplace in some states and filing initial rate requests in other states. The uncertainty around cost-sharing reduction subsidy funding and state and federal legislative and regulatory changes poses a challenge to predict the appropriate level of market participation. This uncertainty could impact the company's future financial performance.

In addition, there is uncertainty surrounding the PBM strategy and the potential transition away from Express Scripts. While the company expects to lower pharmacy costs by more than $3 billion annually, once they transition to their future state, it also recognizes the complexity of a seamless transition for customers. This raises questions about potential abrasion for customers and the overall impact on the company's financials.

Overall, the company's updated 2017 financial outlook reflects improved performance in the Commercial Local Group business, but also acknowledges the uncertain nature of the Individual ACA-compliant marketplace. This uncertainty, coupled with the ongoing policy and regulatory adjustments in healthcare, suggests a level of risk and caution for investors. Therefore, based on the company's recent earnings call and the outlined challenges, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on Anthem Inc.
