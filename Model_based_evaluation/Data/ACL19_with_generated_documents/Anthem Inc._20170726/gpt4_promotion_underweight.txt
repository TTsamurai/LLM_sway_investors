**Underweight Investment Stance Report: Anthem, Inc.**

**Executive Summary:**

In this report, we recommend adopting an 'underweight' investment stance on Anthem, Inc. based on a detailed analysis of the company's most recent earnings call and several critical factors that pose potential risks to the future performance and stability of the company.

**Key Concerns:**

1. **Regulatory and Legislative Uncertainties:**
   Anthem faces considerable challenges due to ongoing changes and uncertainties in health care policies and regulations, particularly concerning the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Medicaid. Any potential unfavorable changes could significantly impact Anthem's Individual and Medicaid business segments.

2. **Declining Individual ACA-compliant Enrollment:**
   Despite strong overall membership growth, Anthem's ACA-compliant individual enrollment presents a downward trend, with a significant decline of 107,000 lives in the last quarter alone, contributing to potential revenue volatility.

3. **Marketplace Stability and Participation Issues:**
   Anthem has expressed repeated concerns about the unpredictability and sustainability of the individual ACA-compliant marketplace. Planned exits from certain state markets underline the challenges faced and a potentially shrinking market footprint could limit future growth potential.

4. **High Dependence on Government Business:**
   The government business segment, while stable, is highly susceptible to changes in federal and state healthcare funding and policies. Any negative developments in this segment due to legislative changes could impair Anthem's financial health.

5. **Operational Risks in Medicaid Contracts:**
   Issues such as underperforming contracts, as seen with the Iowa Medicaid contract, could lead to financial strain. Anthem’s continued challenges in securing actuarially sound rates for Medicaid services could impact profitability.

6. **Potential Risks from Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM) Strategy:**
   Anthem is in the midst of reevaluating its pharmacy strategy, which includes significant changes expected by the end of 2017. The uncertainty and transition risks associated with potentially moving away from Express Scripts could result in operational disruptions and financial uncertainties.

7. **Margins and Profitability Pressures:**
   The company has already forecasted a slight loss in the Individual ACA-compliant business for the year and faces margin pressure across multiple segments, including a notable decrease in operating margins for both the Commercial and Government businesses.

**Conclusion:**

While Anthem has reported strong financial performances in certain areas and exhibits robust membership growth, underlying vulnerabilities primarily linked to regulatory uncertainties, market stability, and operational risks present substantial challenges. Given these factors, an 'underweight' investment stance is advised as a cautious approach until more favorable conditions emerge or Anthem demonstrates a more definitive pathway to overcoming these challenges effectively.

Investors should monitor legislative developments closely, the outcomes of Anthem’s strategic decisions particularly around its PBM strategy, and its ability to maintain profitability in a volatile healthcare market.

**Recommendation:**

Underweight - Monitor developments closely and reconsider stance upon stabilization of regulatory environment and clarification of PBM strategy outcomes.
