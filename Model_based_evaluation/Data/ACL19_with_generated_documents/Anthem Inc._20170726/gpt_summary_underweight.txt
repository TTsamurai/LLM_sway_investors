Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance with Anthem Inc. Here are the key financial metrics driving this recommendation:

1. Individual ACA-compliant business: The company expects this business to operate at a slight loss for the year. Enrollment declined by 107,000 lives, and uncertainties in the marketplace, such as cost-sharing reduction subsidy funding, make it challenging to predict a sustainable future. The company is considering revising rate filings and narrowing participation in certain states.

2. Government business: Flat membership and decline in operating margin for the Government business. Higher performance-based incentive compensation accruals and the impact of the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017 contributed to this decline.

3. Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM) strategy: The company is analyzing options to lower pharmacy costs by more than $3 billion annually by 2020. While the RFP process has provided options, the decision on a long-term pharmacy solution is yet to be made.

4. Legislative and regulatory changes: The evolving policy landscape, especially the impact of state and federal regulatory and legislative changes on the Individual and Medicaid businesses, creates uncertainty for the company. The company is closely monitoring developments and advocating for stable and affordable marketplaces.

In summary, the company's financial performance in certain business segments, uncertainties in the healthcare policy landscape, and the evolving PBM strategy warrant an 'underweight' investment stance. There are challenges in key business segments, and the company's ability to predict stable market participation may be hindered by external factors.
