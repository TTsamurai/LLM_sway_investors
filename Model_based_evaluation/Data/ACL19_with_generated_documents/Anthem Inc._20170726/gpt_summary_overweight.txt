 Dear Investors,

We are pleased to provide a summary report on the recent earnings conference call transcript for the second quarter of 2017. Anthem has reported strong GAAP earnings per share of $3.16 and adjusted earnings per share of $3.37. The company's membership and revenue show positive momentum, with membership reaching nearly 40.4 million members and operating revenues of $22.2 billion in the second quarter. The commercial and government segments both contributed to the strong financial performance.

Anthem has emphasized its commitment to providing access to affordable and high-quality healthcare, recognizing the importance of stability and sustainability in the evolving policy landscape. The company continues to engage in dialogue with state and federal leaders to inform policy development and achieve the goal of creating stable and affordable marketplaces.

In terms of financial outlook, Anthem expects adjusted earnings per share of greater than $11.70 for the full year 2017, reflecting improved performance in the Commercial Local Group business and uncertainty in the Individual ACA-compliant marketplace. The company remains focused on its long-term pharmacy strategy and expects to drive significant value for clients, members, and shareholders.

Additionally, Anthem is actively considering opportunities for mergers and acquisitions in the Medicare Advantage business, and continues to analyze options for the best long-term pharmacy solution. The company maintains a strategic focus on creating market-leading capabilities to effectively manage vulnerable populations and specialized services.

Overall, Anthem's financial performance and strategic initiatives support an 'overweight' investment stance, with positive prospects for growth and value creation in the healthcare industry.

Sincerely,
