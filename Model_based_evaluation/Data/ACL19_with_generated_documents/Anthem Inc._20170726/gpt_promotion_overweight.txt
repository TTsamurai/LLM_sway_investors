Based on the recent earnings call of the company, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the stock. The company reported strong second quarter 2017 GAAP earnings per share of $3.16 and adjusted earnings per share of $3.37, with both membership and revenue tracking well. The membership growth, particularly in the Commercial insured business, has been ahead of expectations, with nearly 40.4 million members. The operating revenues increased by 4.3% versus the second quarter of 2016. Additionally, the company has a strong financial outlook for the full year 2017, expecting adjusted earnings per share of greater than $11.70, which is an increase from their previous outlook.

The company also remains committed to contributing to ongoing policy discussions in Washington and the states on behalf of its members and all Americans, as well as remaining focused on stabilizing and sustaining the marketplace. Despite uncertainties in the marketplace, particularly with the Individual ACA-compliant marketplace, the company is carefully monitoring state and federal legislative and regulatory developments to make informed decisions about their level of market participation.

Furthermore, the company is actively engaged in pursuing M&A opportunities to augment their growth profile, particularly in the Medicare business, and has a strong pipeline of RFP opportunities in the Medicaid business for future growth.

With regards to the company's Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) strategy, they are in the process of analyzing their options to create the best long-term pharmacy solution and are confident in their ability to drive significant value for their clients, members, and shareholders.

In conclusion, based on the company's strong financial performance, commitment to marketplace stability and sustainability, active pursuit of growth opportunities, and strategic planning for their pharmacy benefit management, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the stock. The company's long-term outlook remains positive, and they are well-positioned to deliver value to their shareholders.
