forward. We're also pleased with the progress we've made in inventory management, with a decline in inventory on a per store basis for the second consecutive quarter. We believe this puts us in a strong position to continue our strong cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation strategy. We remain committed to investing in new stores while also returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

In summary, our gross profit improved, SG&A expense increased primarily due to investments in store manager compensation and increased expenses related to new store openings and hurricanes. Our effective tax rate decreased, and we generated strong cash flow from operations. We repurchased shares of our common stock and paid a quarterly dividend, returning cash to shareholders. We have narrowed our guidance for GAAP diluted EPS, increased same store sales growth forecast, updated net sales growth forecast, and revised capital expenditures forecast for fiscal 2017.

Overall, despite the challenges of increased expenses related to new store openings and hurricanes, we are pleased with our strong financial performance and remain focused on driving same store sales, loyalty, and growth opportunities for the future. We continue to manage expenses and capital allocation with the goal of creating lasting value for our shareholders. Thank you for your attention, and I am available to answer any questions or provide further detail on the financial metrics discussed.
