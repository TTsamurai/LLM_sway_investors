Based on the insights and financial metrics derived from the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. This recommendation is based on the following key points:

1. Gross Profit and SG&A Expense: The company experienced a modest increase in gross profit, but SG&A expense increased by 40 basis points over the previous year. This increase was primarily due to increased retail labor expenses and record number of new store openings, resulting in significant incremental expenses. Additionally, the company incurred $24.8 million of incremental expenses related to the impact of hurricanes during the quarter.

2. Inventory and Cash Flow: Although total inventory increased, the company managed to decrease inventory on a per store basis for the second consecutive quarter. The company also reported strong cash flow from operations, with an $18 million increase compared to the previous year. However, it is important to note that the company is lapping significant working capital improvements from the prior year.

3. Capital Allocation Strategy: The company has been repurchasing its common stock and paying dividends to shareholders. It is important to consider the remaining authorization for share repurchases of approximately $635 million. The company aims to maintain an investment grade rating by managing its leverage ratio and remains committed to a disciplined capital allocation strategy.

4. Forecast and Guidance: The company provided an outlook for fiscal year 2017, narrowing the forecast for GAAP diluted EPS and updating net sales growth forecast. However, the guidance does not contemplate potential impact from U.S. Corporate Tax Legislation Reform.

5. Competitive Environment: The company acknowledged the competitive retail environment but stated that the competitor environment has not seen a significant change in the last few quarters. The company emphasized its emphasis on price competitiveness and digital engagement with its core consumer base.

Based on these insights, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on the company, as there are concerns regarding the increase in expenses, potential impact from hurricanes, and uncertainties surrounding the competitive retail environment. Additionally, it is important to consider the potential impact of U.S. Corporate Tax Legislation Reform on the company's financial performance. Further analysis and monitoring of the company's financial metrics and market conditions are recommended to make informed investment decisions.
