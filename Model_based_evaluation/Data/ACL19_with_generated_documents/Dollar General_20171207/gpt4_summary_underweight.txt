#### Concerns and Basis for Underweight Recommendation:

- **Margin Pressures:** High proportion of lower-margin consumable sales and increased transportation costs are pressing gross margins despite efficiency improvements.
- **High SG&A Expenses:** The significant uptick in SG&A as a percentage of sales, driven by increased labor and occupancy costs and disaster-related expenses, suggests rising operational costs that could harm profitability.
- **Aggressive Expansion:** The rapid pace of new store openings (470 new stores, with many from acquisitions) could strain operational efficiency and might not yield the expected returns given the current retail environment.
- **Competitive Landscape:** Despite strong company positioning, the retail landscape is highly competitive and sensitive to economic shifts which could impact consumer spending patterns unfavorably.
- **Dependence on External Factors:** The company's performance is subject to risks from potential impacts of U.S. Corporate Tax Legislation Reform and ongoing economic uncertainties which are not accounted for in the presented guidance.

Investors are recommended to adopt a cautious approach given the potential headwinds and the current financial metrics indicating pressures on profitability and operational efficiency.
