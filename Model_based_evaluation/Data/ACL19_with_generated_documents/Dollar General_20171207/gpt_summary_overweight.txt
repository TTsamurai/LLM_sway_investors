In summary, the company has reported a solid performance for the third quarter of 2017, with improvements in key financial metrics such as gross profit and effective tax rate. Gross profit increased by eight basis points from the previous year's third quarter, primarily due to higher initial inventory mark-ups and lower inventory shrink. Despite a 3.1% increase in total inventory, the company saw a decline of 4.9% on a per store basis, indicating effective inventory management.

The SG&A expense increased by 40 basis points over the previous year, mainly driven by increased retail labor expenses and costs related to the record number of new store openings in the quarter. However, the company is prioritizing disciplined capital allocation and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

Looking ahead, the company has narrowed its forecast for GAAP diluted EPS and raised its same store sales growth forecast to approximately 2.5%. The company is also focusing on driving customer loyalty through value and convenience, and investing in initiatives to support long-term growth.

Overall, the company remains focused on driving consistent, strong financial performance while managing expenses and capital, which positions the business for continued growth. The company's leadership is confident in its ability to maintain momentum and continue to resonate with its core customer base, giving them optimism as they move into 2018. Based on these financial results and outlook, we have an 'overweight' investment stance on the company.
