Based on the third quarter financial results and the earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. The following key financial metrics should be considered:

1. Gross Profit: The gross profit for the 2017 quarter was $1.8 billion, representing 29.9% of sales, which is lower than the previous year's third quarter. The lower gross profit rate can be attributed to higher transportation costs and a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which have lower gross profit rates. This indicates a potential decrease in profitability.

2. SG&A Expense: The SG&A expense increased by 40 basis points to $1.3 billion or 22.9% of sales in the third quarter. This increase was primarily due to higher retail labor expenses, increased incentive compensation, and occupancy costs. The impact of the hurricanes also resulted in incremental expenses. These higher expenses may negatively affect the company's bottom line.

3. Effective Tax Rate: The effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.8%, slightly lower than the previous year's third quarter. The lower tax rate was due to the recognition of greater federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which provided a temporary tax benefit.

4. Inventory Management: Total inventory increased by 3.1% for the quarter, but on a per-store basis, it declined by 4.9%. The company aims to maintain inventory growth in line with or below sales growth. A decline in per-store inventory is a positive sign, but it's important to monitor how the company manages its inventory in the future.

5. Capital Allocation Strategy: The company has repurchased a significant amount of its common stock and returned cash to shareholders through dividends. However, it's crucial to assess the impact of these activities on the company's financial position and growth prospects.

6. 2017 Guidance: The company narrowed its forecast for GAAP diluted EPS and raised the same-store sales growth forecast. However, the guidance does not contemplate potential impact from U.S. Corporate Tax Legislation Reform.

7. Competitive Environment: The competitive environment in retail remains the same, and the company is positioned well price-wise. However, it's important to monitor how the company continues to respond to competition and consumer preferences.

Based on the above financial metrics and outlook, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. The increase in expenses, lower gross profit rate, and potential uncertainties related to tax legislation reform and competitive environment indicate potential challenges for the company's financial performance. It's essential to closely monitor the company's financial management, operational efficiency, and ability to maintain and grow its market position.
