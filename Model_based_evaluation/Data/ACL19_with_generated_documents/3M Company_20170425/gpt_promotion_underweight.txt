Based on the recent earnings call transcripts, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. While the company posted strong organic growth in the first quarter, there are several cautionary factors to consider. The company reported a decrease in sales due to divestitures of non-strategic businesses and a negative impact from foreign currency translation. The company also made significant strategic investments in the first quarter, which impacted margins and earnings per share. Additionally, the company is expecting costs associated with portfolio and supply chain optimization, which will impact earnings in 2017 and potentially into 2018. These factors, combined with the uncertainty around tax rate benefits and the potential impact of divestitures, suggest a cautious approach to investing in the company at this time.
