   - **Margin Expansion:** As temporary costs related to landfill operations decline, the company anticipates margin expansions to the anticipated levels, reaffirming the operational efficiency and growth potential.

**Investment Rationale:**

- **Growth Trajectory:** Continuous strong growth in revenue, yield improvements, and volume increases across key segments suggest a robust forward trajectory for the company.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Despite temporary cost hikes, effective cost management and strategic price increments indicate sustained profitability.
