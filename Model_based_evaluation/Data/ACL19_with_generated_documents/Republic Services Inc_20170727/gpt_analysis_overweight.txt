Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, the company has shown strong revenue growth and internal growth, with a 7.5% increase in revenue compared to the prior year. This increase is attributed to a combination of core price increases, volume growth, fuel recovery fees, energy services revenue, and commodity revenue.

The company's adjusted EBITDA margin was 28% in the second quarter, slightly lower than the prior year due to a 40 basis point increase in landfill operating costs. However, excluding the increase in landfill operating costs, there was 10 basis points of margin expansion driven by strong pricing and volume growth.

The company expects an effective tax rate of approximately 39.5% for the remainder of the year and has reconfirmed its full-year adjusted free cash flow guidance of $875 million to $900 million, representing double-digit growth over the prior year.

Looking ahead, the company anticipates strong revenue growth and expects to see expansion in margins, particularly if the temporary increase in landfill operating costs abates. The company is confident in its ability to achieve 30 to 40 basis points of margin expansion for the entire year if the landfill operating costs are excluded.

Overall, the company has demonstrated solid performance and is poised for future growth and margin expansion. The key financial metrics and insights from the earnings conference call support an 'overweight' investment stance for the company.
