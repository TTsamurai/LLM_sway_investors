 sales growth as we move forward. 

Based on the information from the recent earnings conference call, the company's U.S. business is showing solid growth, with comp sales increasing by 4.1% in Q3. This growth is driven by positive guest count growth and a favorable comp sales gap compared to QSR sandwich competitors. The company's success can be attributed to its compelling value programs, menu news, and targeted mobile offers, as well as the success of its velocity accelerators, such as delivery, digital, and Experience of the Future.

The company is also investing in labor to train for various initiatives, which may have a temporary impact on margins for the next six to 12 months. However, the company is confident in its ability to manage through this short-term situation and is actively ramping up its internal project management capabilities to deploy and maximize each initiative.

Looking ahead to 2018, the company is focused on remaining competitive on value, with plans to introduce a value program focused on $1, $2, and $3 price points. Additionally, the company is excited about the growth potential of its McCaf√© brand, as it looks to tap into the high-margin and under-penetrated coffee category in the U.S.

The company is also deploying the Experience of the Future, which includes initiatives such as curbside check-in and mobile order and pay, to enhance customer satisfaction and offer a more modernized experience. While the deployment of these initiatives may initially result in a slight uptick in service times, the company is seeing significant improvements in overall customer satisfaction.

In terms of the franchisee base, the company is seeing some evolution as it outlines an ambitious growth plan that requires investment. Some Owner/Operators are deciding to exit the system, but the overall U.S. franchise system is expected to remain relatively unchanged in the coming years.

Overall, based on the positive performance and growth initiatives outlined in the recent earnings conference call, I recommend adopting an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company's continued focus on value, menu innovation, digital initiatives, and the modernization of its restaurants positions it for sustained growth and success in the U.S. market.
