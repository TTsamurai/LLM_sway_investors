 sales growth as well. Yes. So I'd say right now we're gearing up for some really exciting changes. But I don't see that they're going to be as big as the operational and tactical changes that we've gone through over the last 12 to 18 months. So I think the heavy lifting of getting the U.S. to run better restaurants is behind us, and we're getting into a really nice operational rhythm now. And I think if we expect as we go forward, some of what we're going to see is more new news launches. And it's launching some of the initiatives that we've already spoken to, to get them further embedded into the business. So I think that's good for us. That's less disruptive than what we've gone through over the last 12 to 18 months. And then I think the same reboot that we took around food, the reboot that we took around how we execute in the restaurant, I think that same type of reboot will be happening in the world of marketing. So I think we've got some really exciting plans in the pipe from both the national side and the local side. And I think it positions to us really strongly as we move forward. Yes. Well, so I think the good, exciting news is that 2018 for us is going to be really launching a number of strong initiatives. I don't see that we're going to see as much perhaps direct margin pressure relative to what we've seen in the last 12 months. And so, the initiatives that we had been talking to you about this year, those are going to be in the early days of 2018 and we saw the impact on margin that those were having. So I think we're going to be launching some of our exciting initiatives without having as much focus on the labor side that we did as we went through the big operational changes over the last 12 months. So all in, I think we're feeling positioned to be in really good spot going into 2018. Thank you.
