 sales growth. Overall, the company's Q3 performance was strong, with comp sales growing by 4.1% and comp sales gap of 440 basis points versus competitors. This growth was driven by positive guest count growth and supported by value programs that resonated with customers. The introduction of Signature Crafted sandwich line and the reintroduction of McCaf√© in the U.S. have also been successful, with the potential to drive future growth. Additionally, the company is seeing encouraging customer response to velocity accelerators, including delivery, digital, and Experience of the Future. The deployment of these initiatives may have a temporary impact on margins for the next six to 12 months, but the company remains confident in managing through this situation.

The company is focusing on remaining competitive with a value program focused on $1, $2, and $3 price points, with the aim to consistently stay competitive on value. The implementation of these initiatives requires investments from Owner/Operators, but the company believes that the plan is balanced, with significant efficiencies being captured in other areas of the business.

The introduction of mobile order and pay, the deployment of Experience of the Future, and the rollout of curbside check-in option are expected to enhance the customer experience and drive customer satisfaction. The company is also seeing early success with digital initiatives and expects these to become a more significant part of comp sales growth in the future.

The report presents a positive outlook for the company's future performance in the U.S. market, highlighting the potential for sustained growth and a focus on customer satisfaction. Based on the strong Q3 performance and the pipeline of growth initiatives, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended for the company. Key financial metrics to monitor include comp sales growth, guest count growth, margin impact of new initiatives, and digital adoption and usage.
