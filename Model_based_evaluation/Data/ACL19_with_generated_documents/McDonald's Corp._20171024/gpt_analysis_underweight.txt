 sales and our sales mix. And then, on delivery, I'd say we're seeing really nice momentum in that as well. And as I mentioned earlier in the call, we've got 3,700 restaurants that are now delivering and we're on track to reach 5,000 restaurants by year-end. And, even just where we are today, I'm excited about the business that we're seeing come in from delivery. It's just importantly, though, we're seeing that we're bringing in new customers into our system through delivery. I think when you look at the price that the customer is willing to pay for delivered food versus off-premise food or in-restaurant food, there is a stair-step step-up that we're seeing. And so it's, I think, really contributing positively to the overall business. And it's happening, I would tell you, in markets that, frankly, have some of the toughest store economics. And so I think it's doing really nice things for the top-line and it's doing some nice things for the P&L profitability at the restaurant level. So, My takeaways from the earnings conference call are as follows: The company has demonstrated solid growth in its U.S. business, with positive comp sales and guest count growth for the past three quarters. The success can be attributed to compelling consistent value programs, menu news, targeted mobile offers, and velocity accelerators like delivery, digital, and Experience of the Future. The company is making significant investments in labor training for various initiatives, which may impact short-term margins, in addition to facing potential long-term labor inflation headwinds due to national unemployment and local legislation. The company is focused on remaining competitive on value with a new value program focusing on $1, $2, and $3 price points, while also investing in the McCaf√© brand for additional growth opportunities. The company is seeing improvements in customer satisfaction with the deployment of the Experience of the Future initiatives. There is a shift in the franchisee base due to performance and investment expectations, with some Owner/Operators deciding to exit the system. The company is also seeing positive momentum in digital and delivery, bringing in new customers and contributing to overall business growth. Based on these insights, the company's strong growth performance and investments in key growth areas like value, digital, and delivery are positive. However, the potential impact of labor inflation and changes in the franchisee base may pose risks to long-term profitability and growth. Therefore, adopting an 'underweight' investment stance for the company would be prudent, keeping in mind the potential short-term impact on margins and the potential long-term challenges related to labor inflation and franchisee changes.
