 sales, particularly as we roll out delivery, as we roll out experience of the future as well. Yeah. So when we look at delivery, certainly, we're seeing strong response to it in the U.S. We just have it in one city within New York, but that city is seeing really nice response to what we're offering. The delivery piece is a tough one, right? Because as you noted, clearly, there's a cost to delivery. But I think the benefit that we're seeing on the delivery side is two-fold. One is obvious is that we're getting additional orders and that's at a higher margin due to the incrementality that's associated with it. The other benefit that we're seeing is transaction size tends to be higher on delivery than a traditional drive-thru order or a traditional front counter order. That's the benefit that we're getting on the delivery side. And so far we're very happy with the way that's being rolled out. We do see that as being a meaningful part of our comp going forward as we roll that out nationwide. And I think that's it's not just about delivery. It's about once delivery hits, we then have to make sure that whatever other ways we blend that in either with digital or with EOTF, that we're getting the most benefit out of it. Yes. So just to kick off the question about Experience of the Future or EOTF, one of the figures that you guys should keep in mind is when we look at EOTF, we see our operating margin on average is about 500 basis points higher in EOTF store versus an average store. So that's a significant benefit. 500 basis points is a lot. That's the range that we see, and it's hard to do apples-to-apples because some of the same store sales that we're getting out of EOTF sales are significantly higher than the same store sales on the average, which means these 500 basis points are on a higher volume as well. So it's not a strict volume lift necessarily, but on a sales lift. We're getting a benefit from an overall margin rate basis, but the challenge, as you pointed out, is that the trade-off for that is we do have to manage through the management getting used to it, getting used to the equipment, the training and all that initial investment that goes with it. So on balance, when we roll these out, the expectation is that we're going get that 500 basis point lift in margin, but we're going to see this initial drag that's going to be, call it, a six month to 12 month term for the initial investment. In the U.S., what we're thinking is by the end of 2018, even in a relative flat market, that we can grow comp sales in the range of 3% or 4% as we get all of the initiatives that are in the mid-to-low teens in terms of deployment completed. And then as we come out of 2018, that will put us in a position where it wouldn't be unreasonable to think about us being able to sustain in the U.S. this range of performance for the next few years. So a flat market growing to 3% to 4% by the end of 2018 is what we're shooting for.
