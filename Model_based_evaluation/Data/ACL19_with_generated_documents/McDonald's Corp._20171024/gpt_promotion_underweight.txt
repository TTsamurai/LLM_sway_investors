 sales growth that we deliver. Yes, so, I mean clearly, delivery is the thing that's come out more recently. So we're seeing that our delivery business is, I would say, it's still relatively small, but we're seeing terrific momentum with the delivery business. We're seeing it particularly in the urban markets that I've mentioned. But certainly it's a higher margin business. So I think that for us I'd say I'm most excited about delivery as just an additional sales layer that can be added to the business, similar to what we're doing with the breakfast business at 10:30. So yes, obviously at Q3, we were talking about we have a 4.1% comp sales gap versus the QSR sandwich competitors, so that was a great result. But as we look ahead to 2018, I would say we're equally, if not more excited about the opportunities in front of us. So, I would say looking on a forward basis, even through 2018, there's still a significant growth opportunity ahead of us. As you know, with most of what we're doing, as you have our core products, but then you layer on top of that delivery or you layer on top other things, you're getting nice margin accretion from that. So we're particularly excited about delivery and all the other growth drivers we have in front of us. Thank you.

Based on the information provided in the recent earnings call, the company is showing signs of growth and success in various aspects such as comp sales and positive guest count growth. However, there are concerns that potential labor inflation and local legislation may lead to increased costs in the future. This could negatively impact the company's profit margin. Additionally, the company's focus on value programs and investments in training and initiatives may also pose a short-term impact on margins. While the company is making efforts to stay competitive on value, there is a cautious approach needed to assess whether the ongoing investments and changes will yield long-term benefits. The company's plans for a holistic multi-year growth strategy, including a focus on investment and performance expectations, may lead to some Owner/Operators exiting the system, which could potentially impact the stability of the franchise system. Therefore, based on the cautious perspective on the company's future financial and operational outlook, a recommendation for an 'underweight' investment stance for the company is advised.
