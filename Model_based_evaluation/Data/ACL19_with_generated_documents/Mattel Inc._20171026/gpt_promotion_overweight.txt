. Our most critical step in our progress is the significantly expanded initiative to structurally simplify our business and right-size our cost structure. The company will unlock substantial resources to invest in our transformation plan and drive towards growth and profit targets. The company has suffered challenges in The Toy Box and certain underperforming brands, exacerbated by the TRU chapter 11 filing. However, we believe these are not long-term issues and expect a turnaround over time. We are taking steps to end the year with clean inventories at retail and work through the long tail of previous product launches. The company plans to eliminate at least $650 million in net costs over the next two years through a structural simplification initiative, including manufacturing, product, SG&A, and marketing. Additionally, we intend to invest approximately $170 million over the next two years as foundational spending for our transformation plan. Our priority investments will focus on omni-channel capabilities, emerging markets, IT improvements, and content and gaming. We expect substantial revenue and margin improvement by investing in these areas. Despite challenges, we continue to believe in the future of the company, given our iconic brands and growth potential. Restructuring our organization, streamlining operations, and reigniting culture are all underway to lay the foundation for accelerated margin improvement and growth. The greater cost reduction from structural simplification will help us reposition our business and deliver on our transformation targets for revenue growth and margins. We remain committed to delivering our transformation plan and maximizing long-term shareholder value. Thank you for your support as we navigate through these transformative changes.
