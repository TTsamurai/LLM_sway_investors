**Future Outlook Report: Adopting an 'Overweight' Investment Stance**
---

**Company: Gartner, Inc.**

### Executive Summary
Our analysis strongly supports an 'overweight' investment stance for Gartner, reinforced by robust third-quarter financial performance, strategic acquisitions, and growth across multiple business segments. The integration of the recently acquired CEB and ongoing investments highlight Gartner’s capability in leveraging opportunities to enhance market presence and future profitability.

### Financial Highlights
- **Adjusted Revenue Growth:** Gartner reported an 11% increase in adjusted revenue in Q3 2017, bringing in $892 million. This growth is driven significantly by the 15% revenue growth in the traditional Gartner business.
- **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** The adjusted diluted EPS for Q3 was $0.65, surpassing the upper boundary of the guidance by $0.13, suggesting effective cost management and operational excellence.
- **Free Cash Flow:** The company showcased a strong free cash flow conversion at 139% of adjusted net income, reflecting healthy liquidity and financial resilience.

### Strategic Developments
- **Integration of CEB:** The integration process is on track, aiming to derive significant synergistic benefits. Initial disruption in the CEB business units seems temporary, with management strategically realigning resources to stabilize and optimize performance.
- **Research and Development (R&D):** The research segment exhibited an 18% adjusted revenue growth in traditional Gartner businesses. The increase in enterprise client count to 11,338, marking a 6% growth, speaks to the expanded market influence of Gartner’s research services.
- **Event and Consulting Services:** The Events business observed a significant 25% year-over-year increase in adjusted revenues, driven by high attendee growth. However, consulting services faced slight challenges, with revenues slightly down due to lower productivity in certain operational segments.

### Market Position and Competitive Advantages
- **Diverse Client Portfolio:** Gartner's significant growth in enterprise clients and a high retention rate of 83% positions the company as a preferred partner in the research and consulting sector.
- **Robust Sales Force Expansion:** An increase in the sales force, including the strategic addition of quotas in previously unattended territories, is expected to bolster contract value growth moving forward.
- **Innovative Product Offerings:** The deployment of new seat-based products, although in the early stages, is anticipated to strengthen the company’s competitive edge and expand its market reach.

### Risks and Considerations
- **Integration Risks:** The ongoing integration of CEB poses inherent risks related to synergy realization and operational stability. However, management’s proactive approach and historical success in integrations provide a positive outlook.
- **Market Competition:** Intense competition in the global research and advisory sector could impact pricing and client acquisition strategies. Gartner’s focus on innovation and customer value is critical in mitigating this risk.

### Financial Outlook
- **Revenue Projections:** For 2017, Gartner projects an adjusted revenue expectation slightly increased to around $3.5 billion, evident of sustained growth momentum.
- **EBITDA Forecast:** The adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2017 has been narrowed, reflecting optimized cost management strategies and focused investment in high-growth areas.
- **EPS Guidance:** The adjusted EPS forecast for 2017 is revised upward, demonstrating confidence in the company’s profitability outlook.

### Recommendation: Overweight
Considering Gartner’s strategic initiatives, robust financial performance, and strong market positioning, we recommend an 'overweight' stance. The company’s adept management of strategic integrations, continuous client base expansion, and innovative service enhancements are pivotal in driving long-term shareholder value. Investors should consider the potential for significant returns given the company's trajectory towards sustained growth and market leadership.
