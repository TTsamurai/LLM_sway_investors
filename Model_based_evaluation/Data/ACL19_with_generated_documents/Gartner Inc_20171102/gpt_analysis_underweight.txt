Based on the recent earnings call transcript, here are some key insights and financial metrics to consider:

- The company reported a 11% growth in combined adjusted revenue for the third quarter of 2017.
- The adjusted EBITDA was $149 million and combined adjusted diluted EPS was $0.65 per share, which was $0.13 above the top-end of their guidance range for the quarter.
- The company's free cash flow conversion was 139% of adjusted net income over the last rolling four quarters.
- The traditional Gartner Research business saw a revenue increase of 18% in the third quarter, with strong performance in total contract value and new business growth.
- Although the acquired CEB research revenues were flat year-on-year, positive metrics such as improvement in retention rates and new business growth were noted.
- The Events business reported a 25% year-on-year increase in revenues, with a 21% increase in same event attendees for the traditional Gartner Events business.
- The Consulting business saw a decline in revenues and gross contribution margin due to operational challenges related to managing partner productivity.
- In the Talent Assessment & Other segment, there was a decline in adjusted revenue by 4%, attributed to open territories and lower tenured salespeople impacting bookings and revenues.
- The company has modestly increased their adjusted revenue outlook and updated their 2017 guidance to reflect these changes.

Based on these insights and financial metrics, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. The challenges in the Consulting and Talent Assessment segments, as well as the flat performance in acquired CEB business, indicate potential weakness in certain areas of the company's operations. This, along with an increase in revenue outlook that might not align with actual performance, suggests caution in investment decisions.
