, coupled with good pacing heading into Q4. Toni, it's Craig. So, the 1% to 11% there was the comparing combined versus CEB standalone. So, that adjustment had a bit of a favorability. So, that was probably worth to the magnitude of about $1 million, a little over a million in the quarter versus what would have been on a combined basis. But that was somewhat expected based on the fact that we did have a softer July and then we saw a little bit of a rebound in August and September.. The company's recent earnings call provided a deep dive into the company's performance across its various business segments. From a traditional Gartner Research perspective, the company has experienced strong growth in adjusted revenues, reflecting mid-teen growth in the third quarter of 2017. Additionally, the company is seeing improvements in sales productivity, retention metrics, and new business growth. However, the acquired CEB business is facing challenges, with flat adjusted research revenues and a slowdown in new business growth. The consulting business is also facing challenges, with a decline in third quarter revenues and gross contribution margin. The Talent Assessment & Other segment has faced declines in both bookings and revenue due to the transition to a stand-alone business.

The company has also faced challenges with increased SG&A and slower-than-expected productivity in certain business areas. These challenges have led to a reduction in expected adjusted EBITDA for 2017.

Overall, while the traditional Gartner business is performing well, the acquired CEB business and consulting segments are facing challenges that have impacted the company's outlook for the year.

In light of these challenges, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended based on the company's recent earnings call. It is important to monitor the company's ability to address the challenges it is facing and execute its growth strategies effectively.
