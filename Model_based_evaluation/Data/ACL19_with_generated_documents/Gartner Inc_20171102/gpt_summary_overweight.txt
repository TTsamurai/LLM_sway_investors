 outweighing our year-to-date NCVI performance on the CEB business. And just particularly on the traditional Gartner Research business, the performance of our sales force on a productivity perspective, the sales productivity is up nicely. We have strong retention metrics. We're just performing quite well across the board. And so, that's really what's driving that increase in our adjusted revenue outlook. And the other line that's moving a little bit, but much more modestly as I mentioned, is the Events business. So, we do expect strong performance as we've seen historically in Q4 for the Events business, which is the second half of our year. And so, we've adjusted that for that as well. But, in general, it really is predominantly driven by stronger traditional Gartner Research performance flowing through. That's what's driving the increase in our adjusted revenue guidance range. And, Toni, the only specific thing I might mention is sometimes there's a little bit of timing issue related to the sales force head count and things like that. But that's probably a pretty modest impact overall on what's driving that growth. And that's absolutely spot on, Toni. And I think you've heard us talk about with so many new products, so much new regions to attack, so many new clients to go get, it is pretty unforgiving not to continue to grow a sales force at the same kind of pace that we've grown our contract value. And I think the health of the business is not just how much contract value growth, it's how well you invest in the future and are positioned for future growth. And as we've said before, the teams are performing well, we're continuing to focus on productivity and sales force growth and it really is setting us up for sustained double-digit growth as we head into 2018 and beyond. Toni, it's Craig. Just one additional comment, the $150 million of free cash flow in Q3, yes, it does include some additional investments in both sales force and various other things, but we also had some significant acquisition and integration payments as well. Long term, as we look at our new products in the TA space, it would be akin to saying if you were buying a full subscription to our GFE business, our Security and Risk Management business, you get access to the whole portfolio. So that's kind of how it would fall out. We're not going with spot or ad hoc purchases, we're going with full subscriptions around the entire portfolio of products. So, in the case of SHL, if you buy one large portfolio, you get access to all the products that we have on a full subscription basis.. And, of note, it's the bundled products in the Talent Assessment space, one of the big historical selling point for SHL, the pre-needle pieces or the occupational assessment. And what's happening in the human capital space these days and it's more broader than Gartner and CEB, everybody is generally looking beyond just that occupational piece and our bundles actually reflect advice, solutions, products and answers that go beyond just that occupational piece. So, they reflect more solutions and business advice. Hamzah, it's Craig. Just to jump in there, historically, we've got great products and we've historically had strong focus on sales force productivity, and now that we're selling more complex products with a wider variety of prices, a larger suite of products, what we're really driving towards is driving a higher average price per transaction and for that transaction to settle in quicker to contract value. But I think to be clear, just average selling price per once or average selling price per product isn't where the financial leverage is really meaning the most to us. It has more to do with individual productivity and the leverage for average selling prices, if you will, are just a function of selling a broader or more comprehensive suite of products. And just to reinforce what Tim has said, as you think about the selling efficiency metric or average selling price metric across our business, you will have situations where the products that naturally are upsold and packaged are in fact higher margin or higher value products. So, higher average selling prices actually drive to that efficiency. We think about it more in terms of not just selling more to a client, but it's actually selling more of the right product to a client. And if you're aiming, it's actually bringing great impact to them. Tim, it's Craig. Just to be clear, on the managing partner side, we had significant growth in sales head count in that space over the last 12 months, so those percentages are small in relative terms, in terms of 8% or 17%, you're multiplying much bigger numbers these days than we historically might have been. The focus there is do we have the right people who can – customers, particularly when it comes to advisory and facilitation. And so, once again, it's a really hyper focus on productivity for folks in those kind of roles and activities and for our more junior managing partners, again, it's actually probably a smaller number, but the intention there is to improve their productivity over time. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, just to reinforce Craig's point and just to think about it broadly on the sales force side, the good news is the acceleration in growth rate whether managing partners are not, for the folks on this call, has been significantly broader than just two teams. We've made really good progress in getting open territories filled. And so, I think that's what's critical. We think of the sales force expansion, it's not just managing partner, which is a part of Consulting, which you know, have dipped on a bottom line here. We're running programs across that sales force spectrum and we're getting open territories filled, managing partner productivity is down in some areas and up in other areas. But Kevin, it's Craig. Just the interesting part about doing virtual events is I don't think that's how clients buy from us on a subscription basis. If they think about our research or certain research parts, or any of the businesses that we're talking about today, it's fairly comprehensive and they have the technology and information readily available. So, I don't necessarily think a shift from traditional to virtual events necessarily follows through in terms of how consulting and research and our transactional other pieces of the business go. Kevin, it's Craig. I think you're right. I think you're thinking about it exactly right. That is long term health. That's what it's really about. And it's this kind of constant balancing act between investing for the future compared to how the numbers are actually falling out at any kind of like moment in time. But unless we make that kind of investment, we're not going to get the required productivity that we need from our sales forces to continue this kind of like new double-digit growth side of the business. Kevin, it's Craig. To your point about it being simple and painful, I think listening to our run rate, that investment is looking more lackluster than you want to see. But it is certainly not simple to actually get all the nuances right. And what we're challenging ourselves to do because we're a couple of months through acquisition is can we get our historical group biases of how we've managed sales forces, which has worked really very well, and take that to traditional CEB sales forces, which is something we've never done before. But we think it's an achievable goal but it's providing a lot of tension and a lot of work and a lot of minds had to be changed constantly as we push through the work. Kevin, to tie those to those step-back moments, let's reinforce the traditional Gartner sales force had managed open territory count better than we have historically and that is a positive sign. But it's the timing issues of how quickly we drive to productivity on the other side which is really causing the tension that you're seeing within the forecast. And then for the second half of the observation, I think we are pulling back on a couple of teams to see productivity rise. And one additional point, I think, it's very important. We've grown really nicely across the world and we're Argentina and Japan this year. And in both those respect, productivity is down because of different client bases, different product bases and so on. And so, it just does show – we just made a worldwide effort of our sales force or the traditional part of CEF and we're still doing a lot of work to improve each territory and client base. Kevin, it's Craig. Just one additional comment on the being closer between traditional CEB productivity and the traditional Gartner productivity, the two pains, the traditional Gartner sales force had significantly better or as much work done across a territory and it's those exact building blocks that we're trying to put into the two tough teams and processes of individual teams, it's just time to get it done. And Kevin, I think, just to be clear. The two territories that we're working to see the productivity turning in, as I commented earlier, is happening in onto a nice territory around areas that where were experiencing dramatic growth. And our other territory where we're growing nicely and over a long track record, those teams so my began to see that is well. So those are the beginning of the steps that you make in the early game plan where you make growth have to be achieved. Kevin, it's Craig. And when you see salaries go up per quarter, we know it's a pain based on the choices we make. And we're taking a breath so we don't burn out our sales force. And also, we're seeing an impact on the bottom line where slow productivity, when they get higher and the right products to see more and more growth out of our recent investments in traditional job side. So, continue to tough choices but that's where tensions really get done. Kevin, it's Craig. Once again, that's exactly the issue. We're now having to process our sales forces with vast growth potential in the old business, as well as the old huge opportunity in the new business. And we tend to be moving back in our seat in moment or focusing on the basics of sales force productivity, based on where tension is most high. And Kevin, it's Craig. Now, we've been at the investment in the c-station, the CEG internships and expansions. And we're telling two teams to give our sales forces in a moment in the market to do their best. And Kevin, it's Craig. One thing to keep in mind, the compress. That's our job. And 5% of the entire all about UTC, expertise improvement with greater recognition. And we air the classes on for the potential opportunity of the biggest third-party results. And the roles to play is all about trying to generate and call Labor and Clinton throughout all of that. Kevin, it's Craig. I would just add to I would change here. We have targeted teams to ground specifically in Clinton, but I think it's worth keeping in mind that even in the recent year and even within 11% on percentile last year, that was 8 teams that have fallen. And we're talking about it's important that any new sale gets us a few more good ideas to deliver. And so even getting up to these workload regulations, the growth side is starting to perform. Now on a cost leave, we're still on a good place. And Kevin, it's Craig. Incremental now is a lot of hardworking to be made. And then an acknowledgment, we think for coming to and not. But we also know that the productive sales forces having delivered last topics are better in turn good lack of productivity in some newer products in traditional fashion.
