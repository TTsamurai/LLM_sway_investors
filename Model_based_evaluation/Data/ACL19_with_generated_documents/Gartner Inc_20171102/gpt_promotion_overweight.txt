. In general, our traditional Gartner Research business is performing very well and driving strong contract value growth. The impact of new seat-based products is expected to be positive in the long-term, as they are higher value products. The Events and Consulting businesses are also performing well, with strong growth in revenues. The challenges in the TA & Other segment are being addressed, and strategic alternatives for the Talent Assessment business are being explored. Overall, the company is on track to achieve its financial goals for the year, and there is confidence in future growth and value creation. The increase in EPS guidance for the year reflects the better-than-expected performance in Q3 and the confidence in sustained double-digit growth over the long term.

If one were to recommend an 'overweight' investment stance based on the company's recent earnings call transcript, it would be justified by the positive performance and outlook of the company's core business segments, including Research, Events, and Consulting, as well as the management's proactive approach to addressing challenges and exploring new opportunities for growth.
