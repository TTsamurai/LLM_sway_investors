**Investment Report: Overweight Recommendation on Gartner**

**Executive Summary:**
We strongly recommend an ‘Overweight’ investment position on Gartner, Inc. (NYSE: IT), following a comprehensive analysis of the company's Q3 2017 earnings call, which revealed substantial financial and operational improvements. Gartner has demonstrated robust revenue growth, especially in its traditional businesses, alongside effective integration of the recently acquired CEB, making it a compelling investment opportunity with a highly optimistic growth trajectory.

**Financial Performance and Growth:**
Gartner reported an impressive 11% growth in adjusted revenue reaching $892 million for Q3 2017, surging past the forecasted top-end guidance. The traditional Gartner business experienced a remarkable 15% growth, highlighting the company's robust core operations and effective market strategies. The integration of CEB, despite its growing pains, shows promising signs of improvement that can accelerate future earnings. Moreover, Gartner’s EBITDA for the quarter stood at $149 million, substantiating strong profitability margins.

**Research and Innovation:**
Gartner’s investment in research has yielded a substantive 13% revenue growth in this segment, with an adjusted gross contribution margin at a solid 69%. Notably, the company's traditional Gartner Research business posted an 18% increase in revenues. Gartner’s continued investment in acquisitions like L2 and Machina Research enhances its innovative capabilities and offerings, reinforcing its market leader status.

**Operational Excellence:**
The effective integration of CEB highlights Gartner’s strong operational capabilities. Adjusted revenues for the CEB segment showed signs of stabilization and modest improvements, reflecting the rigorous integration efforts that focus on crafting high-value offerings and improving sales productivity. Gartner's relentless focus on operational execution and the expansion of sales forces position the company well for sustained growth.

**Strategic Investments:**
The commitment to strategic investments is evident from Gartner’s significant quarter-over-quarter headcount increase in quota-bearing sales associates. These investments are projected to bolster future contract value growth as the company optimizes its go-to-market strategies and leverages its expanded global sales force.

**Robust Financial Health:**
Gartner continues to display excellent free cash flow conversion, evidenced by a 139% conversion rate of adjusted net income over the last rolling four quarters. This exceptional ability to generate cash provides the company with ample flexibility to pursue further growth opportunities, deleverage its balance sheet, and enhance shareholder returns.

**Forward-Looking Guidance:**
Gartner updated its 2017 guidance, raising the full-year adjusted revenue outlook to approximately $3.5 billion and tightening the EBITDA projection while notably increasing the adjusted EPS outlook. This revision is indicative of management's confidence in the company's future performance and its operational efficiency. 

**Recommendation:**
Based on Gartner’s robust Q3 performance, promising strategic initiatives, and upwardly revised future guidance, we recommend an 'Overweight' position on Gartner. The company's sustained ability to outperform, combined with strong market positioning and ongoing strategic investments, supports a bullish outlook, making Gartner a compelling addition to growth-focused investment portfolios.
