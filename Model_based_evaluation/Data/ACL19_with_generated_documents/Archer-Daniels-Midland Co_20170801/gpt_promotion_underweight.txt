Based on the company's recent earnings call, it is recommended to take a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company and recommend an 'underweight' investment stance. The company's adjusted EPS and segment operating profit have increased, but there were charges related to impairments, restructurings, and settlements, as well as LIFO. Net interest expense and unallocated corporate costs have also increased, and there are no concrete plans for 2018 yet. Despite some improvements in operations, the company's balance sheet remains slightly down, and the leverage position is comfortable but not outstanding. The company's actions to control costs and generate savings do not provide enough confidence to suggest a 'neutral' or 'overweight' investment stance at this time.
