Such robust financials underscore the company's efficient operational management and strong market positioning.

**Strategic Acquisitions and Diverse Portfolio:**
The integration of LinkedIn has resulted in substantial revenue enhancement, contributing approximately four percentage points to our growth. This strategic acquisition not only diversifies our product offerings but also broadens our professional network reach, substantially boosting gross margins and operational influence despite a temporary drag on operating income growth due to amortization costs.

**Cloud Services – A Growth Engine:**
Our commercial cloud segment has reached a staggering revenue run rate of over $15.2 billion, posting a 52% growth. The vertical's gross margin percentage marked a substantial increase to 51%, driven by performance improvements across flagship services like Office 365 and Azure.
