Based on the malware incident and the transition impact of the India GST, the company's second quarter results were largely in line with expectations. The incident had a negative impact of approximately 240 basis points to organic net revenue, or about $140 million. The company expects to recover a majority of the delayed second quarter shipments in the third quarter, but anticipates some impacts from the incident in the third quarter as well. Additional one-time costs related to the incident are also expected in the second half, though they are not expected to be material to the company's results.

Despite the incident, the company reported strong results in several areas, such as global e-commerce net revenues, which grew by 30%. In Europe, the company executed well, especially in the chocolate business, and several emerging markets, such as India, Vietnam, and Mexico, showed stabilizing and improving macro outlooks.

The company reported a strong second quarter margin performance, with adjusted OI margin increasing by 90 basis points to 15.8%. However, the adjusted gross margin decreased by 10 basis points due to unfavorable mix and higher input costs, particularly in dairy.

Regionally, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Latin America showed strong margin expansion, while North America faced challenges in the second quarter, largely due to the malware incident. The company expects improved results in the back half of the year, driven by DSD-driven share gain plans and new product launches.

The company reported 1.5% growth in the snacking category, with stabilization in market share. Biscuit revenue declined, while chocolate business grew by 5%, driven by solid results in Germany, India, and Brazil.

In terms of earnings per share, the company delivered adjusted EPS of $0.48 in the second quarter, up 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by strong operating income growth. The company expects to deliver double-digit EPS growth for the full year.

The company's outlook for the full year remains unchanged, with organic net revenue growth of at least 1%, adjusted OI margin in the mid-16% range, and double-digit adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis. The company also expects to deliver approximately $2 billion in free cash flow for the year.

Overall, the company is confident in its ability to have a much better second half and aims to address the challenges it faced in the first half through initiatives such as accelerated distribution expansion and new product launches. However, the incident has underscored the need for further improvements in the company's global systems environment to prevent future disruptions. Based on the financial metrics and the impact of the malware incident, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended.
