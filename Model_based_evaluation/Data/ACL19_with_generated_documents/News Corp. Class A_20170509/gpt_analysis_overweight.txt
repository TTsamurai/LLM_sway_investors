. Thank you for the great insights provided in the earnings conference call transcript. Based on the robust growth in revenues and EBITDA, as well as the positive performance of the various segments of the company such as Move, REA, News and Information Services, as well as the partnerships and digital initiatives, I would recommend an 'overweight' investment stance for this company. The company has shown significant improvements in digital real estate services, with growth in revenues and EBITDA, and is also making progress in building a new digital advertising platform focused on the U.S. market. Additionally, the company's strong presence in the digital news and information space, with improvements in digital subscriptions and ad revenues, complements its overall growth strategy. The recent acquisitions of Harlequin and Wireless Group have also contributed positively to the company's transformation. Overall, the company's strong financial metrics, successful digital initiatives, and strategic acquisitions make it an attractive investment opportunity.
