 is brand safe. So, creating a new advertising platform focused on the U.S. market using data, content, and audiences of our businesses to ensure brands have real reach and are not subject to guilt by association is a key initiative for the future. This is in line with our efforts to combat the digital duopoly and create a healthier ecosystem that rewards quality content.

In conclusion, while the company has shown positive results in its third-quarter earnings, there are challenges ahead, particularly in the print advertising segment. The digital transformation and diversification efforts have shown promise, but the continued decline in print advertising and the need for comprehensive media reform in Australia are key areas of concern. Based on the financial metrics provided, including revenue growth and EBITDA expansion, we recommend adopting an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. The focus on digital real estate services and the ongoing development of a new digital advertising platform show potential, but the challenges in the print advertising segment and the need for comprehensive media reform in Australia present significant risks for long-term investment.
