 with their brand. Our new digital advertising platform will leverage the data, content, and audiences of our businesses to ensure brands have a real reach and are not subject to guilt by association. We are also working closely with partners like Facebook and Google to ensure that premium content is valued and rewarded in the digital advertising ecosystem. Despite the positive results in our recent earnings call, there are several concerns that should be taken into consideration before making an investment in our company.

First, the print advertising segment remains challenging, with declines seen across our mastheads. While there has been some moderation in these declines, it is still a cause for concern as digital advertising continues to grow and dominate the market.

Additionally, the digital advertising ecosystem is dysfunctional and defiled, with consequences such as fake news and brand safety issues. While we are making progress on developing a new digital advertising platform, it is important to note that there is still a long way to go in addressing these issues and ensuring that premium content is valued and rewarded.

Furthermore, there are challenges in the Australian market, with print ad declines moderating but still impacting circulation revenues. The business in Australia is focused on digital subscriptions, but conditions remain challenging.

Overall, while there have been positive results in our business segments such as real estate services and news and information services, there are still significant challenges and uncertainties in the advertising and media landscape that should be considered before making any investment decisions. Therefore, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company until these concerns are addressed and resolved.
