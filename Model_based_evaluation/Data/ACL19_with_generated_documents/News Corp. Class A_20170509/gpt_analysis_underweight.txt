 with their brands.

In summary, the company has shown positive results in its ongoing mission to become more global, digital, and cost-conscious. Revenue and EBITDA have seen growth, particularly in the digital real estate services segment, where revenue grew by 15% and EBITDA contribution at Move improved. Additionally, the news and information services segment saw growth in revenues and EBITDA, driven by the performance of installed product revenues at News America Marketing and healthy circulation revenue gains at the Wall Street Journal. The company has also seen a robust growth in digital subscribers at the Wall Street Journal, with digital now accounting for 53% of total subscriptions.

However, despite these successes, there are challenges in the print advertising sector, and the company continues to face difficulties with the digital duopoly created by Facebook and Google, which has commoditized content and created a dysfunctional ecosystem. The company is in discussions with these tech giants about premium content and brand-enhancing environments, but it is fair to say that Facebook is more responsive and responsible than Google at this stage. It is clear that there is a need for comprehensive media reform in Australia to support the company's efforts to increase yields and create a brand-enhancing environment for advertisers.

Based on the company's recent earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. While the company has shown growth and positive results in its digital and real estate segments, the challenges in the print advertising sector and the need for comprehensive media reform in Australia pose risks to the company's future performance. Additionally, the company's ongoing discussions with tech giants like Facebook and Google about premium content and brand-enhancing environments may not yield meaningful results in the near term. Therefore, it is advisable to approach investment in the company with caution.
