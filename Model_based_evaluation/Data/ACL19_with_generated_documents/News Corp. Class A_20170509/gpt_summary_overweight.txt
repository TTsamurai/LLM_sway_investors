 is brand-safe. So by offering a premium ad platform that uses our own data and content, we can ensure that brands are getting the quality and safety they desire. This platform has already been launched in Australia and will be coming to the U.S. soon. Additionally, our digital subscriber growth at the Wall Street Journal is a testament to the enduring value of premium news and commentary, and we see potential to upsell these subscribers to even more premium products in the future.

In terms of our financial performance, key metrics show strong growth in revenues and EBITDA across various segments. Move, home to realtor.com, reported a 15% increase in revenues in the quarter, showing acceleration from previous levels. REA, which completed the sale of its European businesses, also posted strong revenue and expanded EBITDA contribution in its core Australian business. News and Information services saw revenue growth of almost 3% and EBITDA expansion of more than 30%, excluding the settlement charge at News America Marketing in the prior year.

Digital subscriptions and advertising continue to drive growth, with digital accounting for over 50% of total subscription at the Wall Street Journal. The New York Post digital network has also seen more than 50% of its ad revenues coming from digital sources. Additionally, the Sun has surpassed the mirror as the second most reviewed website in the UK, doubling its monthly unique visitors in the past year.

In addition to digital growth, our acquisitions have played a crucial role in transforming our business. Investments in realtor.com, Harlequin, and Wireless Group have all contributed to increasing our digital footprint and expanding our offerings in various markets. These strategic moves have laid the groundwork for future growth and expansion.

In conclusion, we see the continued value of premium content and the potential for further growth in digital subscriptions and advertising. Our strategy of global, digital, and diversified operations has shown positive results, and we see opportunities for further development in the software and services businesses. We remain optimistic about the future prospects of our businesses and the long-term value we can create for our shareholders. As a financial analyst, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company based on the strong financial metrics and potential for future growth.
