Based on the recent earnings call, it is important to adopt a cautious stance towards CenturyLink. The company's COO is optimistic about the integration with Level 3 and the potential for growth, but it is important to note that the acquisition was just completed and there is no concrete evidence of the company's ability to achieve the synergies they've discussed.

The COO's emphasis on increasing free cash flow per share is a positive indicator, but it is essential to remain skeptical given the challenges associated with integration and transformation. The company's 17:23 on ROX (return on experience) is also a cause for concern, as it may indicate a lack of focus on consumer-focused revenue.

Additionally, the comments made by the management team regarding their ability to support the dividend and invest in growing the business are not yet backed by concrete results. The COO's statement that the company is well-positioned as a leading telecommunications provider in the global marketplace, although promising, needs to be met with caution.

Overall, while there are positive indicators in the company's recent earnings call, the cautious and skeptical perspective advises an 'underweight' investment stance on CenturyLink at this time. It is important to monitor the company's progress in achieving the integration, transformation, and growth targets before considering any significant investment.
