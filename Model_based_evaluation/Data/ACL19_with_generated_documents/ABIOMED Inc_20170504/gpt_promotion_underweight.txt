Dear Investors, 

After carefully reviewing the recent earnings call from Abiomed, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company for the following reasons:

1. While the company has shown strong revenue growth and achieved FDA PMA approval for new treatments and therapies, we believe the market projections for the next fiscal year may be too optimistic. The company's projections for growth in Protected PCI and AMI cardiogenic shock appear overly ambitious, and we advise caution in placing too much emphasis on these figures.

2. The regulatory update for the Japan launch has been delayed, which may impact the timeline and potential market penetration in the region. The success in Japan is critical for the company to achieve its long-term growth objectives, and any setbacks in this market could have a significant impact on the company's overall performance.

3. The company's focus on heart recovery and the introduction of new products and indications is promising, but the competition in the med-tech market may intensify in the coming years. While the company is confident in its ability to innovate and stay ahead of competitors, we advise a cautious approach when considering future market conditions and competition.

Overall, while Abiomed has achieved significant milestones and demonstrated strong financial performance, we recommend a cautious and skeptical approach to investing in the company at this time. We advise closely monitoring future developments and market conditions before making any significant investment decisions. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
