Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that Abiomed is in a strong position for growth in the future. The company has achieved significant revenue growth, FDA approvals, and expansion into new markets like Japan. The company has a solid balance sheet, with a substantial cash position and no debt, which enhances its ability to invest in and defend its intellectual property.

The growth in Protected PCI and AMI cardiogenic shock continues to position Abiomed as a leader in the medical device industry. The company's focus on heart recovery and the Impella Quality IQ Assurance Program is driving improved clinical outcomes, as evidenced by the Detroit Cardiogenic Shock Initiative.
