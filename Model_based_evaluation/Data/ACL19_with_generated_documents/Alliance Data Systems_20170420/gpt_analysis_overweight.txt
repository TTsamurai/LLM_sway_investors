Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, the company showed positive growth in revenue and core EPS in the first quarter of 2017, which exceeded guidance. The adjusted EBITDA net remained flat, primarily due to a reserve bill at Card Services and a decrease in adjusted EBITDA at AIR MILES. However, the company expects a moderation in delinquency trends and believes that the quarterly reserve bill will moderate. Additionally, they expect the year-over-year hole in AIR MILES adjusted EBITDA to close as program changes are implemented over the course of 2017.

The company's LoyaltyOne segment saw a decrease in revenue and adjusted EBITDA, but they expect the burn rate to normalize at about 78% for the full year 2017. The BrandLoyalty segment also experienced a decrease in revenue and adjusted EBITDA, largely due to program timing between years and unfavorable FX rates. However, there are high potentials for 2017.

On the other hand, the Epsilon segment showed positive results with revenue and adjusted EBITDA both increasing. There was a good balance of revenue growth in key product categories, and the company saw a sequential improvement in the decline of the Data and affiliate product offerings. Additionally, the company expects the Conversant Agency to stabilize as it reaches a level where it is less than 5% of Epsilon's revenue.

In terms of Card Services, the company reported an increase in revenue and operating expenses but expressed a strong start to the year in terms of expense leveraging. The company also saw an increase in adjusted EBITDA net despite a billed allowance for loan losses. Credit sales also increased, with over one-third of credit sales for the quarter being through digital channels.

Overall, the company maintains an optimistic outlook for the future, with expectations of moderate growth and stability in various segments. Given the positive financial metrics and outlook presented in the conference call, an 'overweight' investment stance for the company seems warranted.
