3. Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA net was flat at $440 million compared to the first quarter of 2016. A $72 million reserve billed at Card Services and a $17 million decrease in adjusted EBITDA at AIR MILES dampened the growth rate for the quarter.
4. Reduced Breakage Rate: The lower breakage rate at AIR MILES entering 2017, at 20% compared to the historical 26%, impacted profitability.
5. LoyaltyOne Revenue: AIR MILES revenue decreased 6% to $181 million for the first quarter of 2017, largely due to a 4% decline in AIR MILES redeemed.
6. BrandLoyalty Revenue: BrandLoyalty revenue and adjusted EBITDA decreased 6% to $152 million and 14% to $24 million respectively compared to the first quarter of 2016.
7. Epsilon: Epsilon started the year strongly with revenue up 7% and adjusted EBITDA up 5%, with a better balance of revenue growth in key product categories.

9. Digital Sales: Over one-third of credit sales for the quarter were through digital channels, reflecting the change in the retail landscape.
10. Margin Expansion: The company is focusing on margin expansion, particularly in the back half of 2017, including negotiating better vendor pricing and introducing new acquisition capabilities to reduce application abandonment rates.
11. Client Resilience: No significant client attrition or portfolio impact was reported, and the company expects a return to flat growth year-over-year as early as Q3. The loss rates from retailers going out of business were similar to the overall portfolio experience.
12. Revenue Growth vs. Payroll Growth: The company is focused on ensuring that the revenue growth rate is better than the payroll growth rate, with a comparison of revenue to payroll being relevant.
13. Client Acquisition: Epsilon is benefiting from the signing of new clients, with an estimate of as high as 50 new clients in the current year, contributing to revenue growth.
14. Gross Yield: The gross yield for Card Services was reported to be 25.5%, consistent with the average in the previous year, and could see a slight increase based on further interest rate changes.
