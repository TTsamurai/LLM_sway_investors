Based on the recent earnings call, there are several reasons to be cautious about the company's performance. The decrease in revenue and adjusted EBITDA at AIR MILES, as well as BrandLoyalty, raises concerns about the company's ability to maintain growth in these key segments. Additionally, the decline in Epsilon's platform offering and Conversant Agency's consistent drag on revenue are areas of concern. The increase in Card Services' revenue is positive, but the company's focus on cost-to-mile reduction and the impact of interest rate increases on its business model are potential risks. The company's efforts to stabilize these areas may take time, and it's important to monitor these trends closely. Based on these factors, it may be prudent to recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company.
