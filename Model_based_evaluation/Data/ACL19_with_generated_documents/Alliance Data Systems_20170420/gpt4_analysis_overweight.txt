### Future Outlook Report: Overweight Investment Stance

#### Company Overview:

The company under review had a robust start to 2017, surpassing its initial revenue and EPS guidance. The higher-than-anticipated performance was driven by improvement in several key verticals, including a significant revenue increase in Card Services. However, certain challenges, particularly in AIR MILES and conversant operations, have tempered overall growth prospects temporarily. 

#### Financial Performance Highlights:

1. **Revenue Growth:**
   - The company registered a 12% increase in revenue to $1.88 billion.
   - Card Services revenue surged by 22% mainly because of higher gross yields.

2. **Earnings Performance:**
   - Core EPS grew by 2% to $3.91.
   - Adjusted EBITDA was flat at $440 million due mainly to a $72 million reserve build at Card Services and a $17 million decrease in AIR MILES' adjusted EBITDA.

3. **Capital Allocation:**
   - There was significant share repurchase activity, with $415 million spent during Q1 as part of a $500 million board authorization.

4. **Operational Highlights:**
   - The loyalty program, AIR MILES, saw a decrease due to lowered breakage rates but is in a transition phase with expectations for margin improvements.
   - Epsilon showed positive momentum, with revenue up 7% and adjusted EBITDA up 5%.
   - Digital transformation in Card Services, coupled with cost management practices, is expected to bolster future profitability.

#### Strategic Direction and Growth Prospects:

The company's strong commitment to three major assertions as starting goals for the year indicates a promising direction:

1. **Stabilization in Epsilon:** Expected to return to a positive revenue and adjusted EBITDA trajectory with successful stabilization of its technology platform.
2. **Credit Normalization:** Predicted conclusion by the end of 2017, aligning with current trends.
3. **Retooling AIR MILES:** Ongoing process but with promising early signs of increasing EBITDA margins expected by year-end.

Moreover, the company's proactive steps in bolstering its digital offering in Card Services, especially a new frictionless mobile acquisition capability, show adaptability to the evolving retail landscape. This should further enhance competitive advantages and customer acquisition rates.

#### Risks and Mitigation:

- **Customer Attrition in Epsilon** was identified as an issue but is now appearing to stabilize with no recent significant losses and adjustments to product offerings.
- **Outstanding Reserves** from Card Services have been a significant expenditure; however, these are expected to reduce in the subsequent quarters.
- **Loyalty Programs:** The AIR MILES program faces ongoing challenges; nevertheless, efforts to minimize cost per mile redeemed are likely to gradually offset recent profit declines.

#### Conclusion and Investment Rationale:

Based on the assessment of the company's fiscal performance, strategic initiatives underway, and the managing of operational challenges, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities, particularly in Card Services with digital expansion, and Epsilon's recovery. Expected moderation in deleterious reserves and potential recovery in AIR MILES' profitability further bolster this stance. Investors could benefit from appreciable returns as these strategies unfold over the near to medium term. 

This outlook is projected with cautious optimism, accounting for consistent delivery on key business transformations and market stability. Investors should monitor quarterly progress closely, especially concerning Epsilon's client base and AIR MILES' restructuring outcomes to ensure alignment with the predicted recovery trajectory.
