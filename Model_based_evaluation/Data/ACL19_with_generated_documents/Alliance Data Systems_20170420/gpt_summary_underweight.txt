Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. Revenue increased by 12% to $1.88 billion and core EPS increased by 2% to $3.91 in the first quarter of 2017, however, adjusted EBITDA net was flat at $440 million compared to the first quarter of 2016. This was due to a $72 million reserve build at Card Services, and a $17 million decrease in adjusted EBITDA at AIR MILES due to the breakage reset at the end of 2016.

The decrease in AIR MILES revenue and adjusted EBITDA is a cause for concern, with a 6% decrease in revenue and a 32% decrease in adjusted EBITDA. The burn rate for miles redeemed is still elevated, and adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to increase in the back half of 2017 due to program changes.

BrandLoyalty also experienced a decrease in revenue and adjusted EBITDA, largely due to program timing between years and unfavorable FX rates. The North American expansion effort did not show much progress in the first quarter of 2017.

Epsilon's results were strong, with revenue up 7% and adjusted EBITDA up 5%. However, there were some declines in certain product offerings, such as the data and affiliate product offerings, as well as the Conversant Agency.

Card Services saw a significant increase in revenue, operating expenses, and adjusted EBITDA net. The company was active with its repurchase program during the first quarter, spending $415 million of the $500 million board authorization to acquire 1.7 million shares.

Overall, while there were some positive aspects in the report, such as revenue growth in certain divisions, the significant decreases in revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the AIR MILES and BrandLoyalty divisions raise concerns. The decrease in EBITDA margins in certain offerings within Epsilon is also a point of caution. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance is advised.
