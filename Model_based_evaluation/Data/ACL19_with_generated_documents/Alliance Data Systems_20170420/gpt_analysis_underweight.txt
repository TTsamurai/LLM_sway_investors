Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, the company's performance in the first quarter of 2017 was generally positive, with revenue exceeding guidance and core EPS showing growth. However, there are several factors that lead to an 'underweight' investment stance.

First, while revenue and core EPS exceeded guidance, adjusted EBITDA net was flat compared to the first quarter of 2016, with a significant reserve build at Card Services and a decrease in adjusted EBITDA at AIR MILES due to the breakage reset. Additionally, the decrease in AIR MILES redeemed and the lower breakage rate impacted the adjusted EBITDA negatively.

Moreover, the decrease in revenue and adjusted EBITDA at AIR MILES and BrandLoyalty, and the consistent decline in Epsilon's offering, point to potential weaknesses in the company's loyalty and marketing divisions. The stability and growth of these key product categories will also be crucial for future performance.

Furthermore, the increase in reserve build at Card Services and the potential impact of interest rate hikes on gross yields could pose challenges to the company's profitability. Additionally, the decrease in active collector statistics at AIR MILES and the negative impact of exchange rates on BrandLoyalty revenue and adjusted EBITDA are areas of concern.

Despite the positive performance in the first quarter, the company's outlook should be approached with caution, as the potential challenges in key divisions and the impact of external factors such as interest rate hikes and exchange rates could weigh on the company's future performance. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance is warranted based on the insights and financial metrics derived from the recent earnings conference call.
