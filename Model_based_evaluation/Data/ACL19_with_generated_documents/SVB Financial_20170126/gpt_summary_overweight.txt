Based on the earnings conference call transcript, the key financial metrics can be summarized as follows:

1. Healthy loan growth: Average loans grew by $614 million or 3.3% to $19.3 billion, driven primarily by private equity capital call lines and the private bank. Strong period-end loan growth of $788 million or 4.1% was driven primarily by private equity, early-stage, and sponsored buyout.

2. Strong total client funds growth: Average total client funds grew $3.7 billion or 4.5% to $84.7 billion in the fourth quarter. This reflected strong average deposit growth of $1.8 billion or 4.7% and average client investment funds growth of $1.9 billion or 4.3%.

3. Higher net interest income: Net interest income increased by $7.4 million to $296.6 million in the fourth quarter, driven by higher average loan balances and an increase in interest income from fixed income securities.

4. Stable credit quality: Credit quality remained stable overall, with an allowance for loan losses of $225.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter, and stable net loan charge-offs and non-performing loans.

5. Solid core fee income growth: Core fee income increased $4.1 million or 5.1% to $84.6 million in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by higher foreign exchange and lending-related fee income.

6. Higher expenses: Non-interest expense increased by $22.8 million or 10% to $244.6 million in the fourth quarter, driven by an increase in the provision for unfunded credit commitments, additional compensation and benefits expense, and regulatory and infrastructure spending.

Based on these financial metrics, the company's outlook for 2017 is positive, with improved balance sheet growth rates, net interest income growth, stable credit quality, and higher core fee income. The company's capital position remains healthy, and discussions about potential options for capital deployment are starting to happen in 2017. 
As a financial analyst, I would recommend an 'overweight' investment stance based on the strong financial performance and positive outlook for the company.
