Based on the transcript of the recent earnings conference call, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. The key financial metrics indicate a healthy loan growth, strong total client funds growth, and higher net interest income, but there are concerns about the slightly lower net interest margin, stable credit quality, and higher expenses.

The average loans grew by 3.3% to $19.3 billion, driven by private equity and the private bank, and the period-end loan growth of 4.1% points to healthy momentum. There was a return to growth in total client funds, with strong average deposit growth and client investment funds growth. Net interest income increased by $7.4 million to $296.6 million, driven by higher average loan balances, but the net interest margin decreased by 2 basis points to 2.73%. Credit quality remained stable, but non-performing loans increased in the fourth quarter.

Non-interest income decreased, mainly related to lower net gains on investment securities and warrants, and non-interest expenses increased by 10%. There was a notable increase in provision for unfunded credit commitments and additional compensation and benefits expense due to stock price increases. The effective tax rate decreased to 35.5%.

The 2017 outlook has improved somewhat but assumes no further rate increases. Balance sheet growth rates are expected to be in the mid-to high teens for loans and the mid-to high single digits for deposit balances. Net interest income is expected to grow at a low teens percentage rate, and credit quality is expected to remain stable. Non-interest expense is expected to increase at a high single-digit percentage rate.

In conclusion, the company's strong growth and stability are overshadowed by concerns about the net interest margin, stable credit quality, and increasing expenses. Therefore, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance until these factors improve.
