As your stock promoter, it gives me great pleasure to present a compelling case for an 'overweight' investment stance on our company for prospective and existing investors. Based on our latest earnings call and financial performance, here are the key highlights and reasons why an increased investment in our company seems not just prudent, but potentially highly profitable.

1. **Robust Loan Growth**: We reported a considerable increase in average loans which grew by $614 million or 3.3% to $19.3 billion. Notably, this growth was driven by significant activity in our private equity capital call lines and the private bank. The strong trajectory suggests a continued upward momentum.

2. **Expansion in Total Client Funds**: There was a noticeable growth in total client funds, now standing at $84.7 billion, an increment of 4.5% in just this quarter. This rise is due to increased funding rounds and successful new client acquisitions, indicating robust business health and an expanding customer base.

3. **Increase in Net Interest Income**: Despite a slight dip in net interest margin, our net interest income rose by $7.4 million to $296.6 million, aided by higher average loan balances and a beneficial uptick from the recent Fed funds rate increase. This indicates sound revenue generation capabilities from core operations.

4. **Stable Credit Quality**: Our stable credit quality, marked by a strategic decrease in allowance for loan losses and well-managed provisions for loan losses, underscores our strong risk management framework and should reassure investors about the sustainability of our earnings.

5. **Solid Core Fee Income Growth**: We witnessed a solid rise in core fee income, which increased by $4.1 million or 5.1% to $84.6 million, particularly driven by higher foreign exchange and lending-related fees. This diversification in revenue streams enhances our financial stability and growth prospects.

6. **Commendable Capital Position**: Our healthy capital ratios, evidenced by a Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.67%, reflect a strong balance sheet. This robust capital framework supports our growth initiatives and shields against potential volatilities.

7. **Positive 2017 Outlook**: Looking ahead, we project significant growth across key financial metrics. Anticipated high-teen percentage growth in average loan balances and substantial increases in net interest income and core fee income, combined with a controlled increase in expenses, paint a promising picture for the future.

8. **Strategic Positioning**: As we continue to capitalize on the favorable shifts in market rates and leverage our platform's capabilities, we remain uniquely positioned to benefit from industry trends in private equity, venture capital, and high-growth banking sectors.

9. **Leadership and Strategy**: With new leadership dynamics and a clear focus on leveraging our strong market position, we are poised to deliver increased value to our investors and retain our competitive edge.

In conclusion, our companyâ€™s proven track record of financial performance, coupled with strategic growth initiatives and solid market positioning, makes this an opportune time to invest. The improved outlook for 2017 and beyond, supported by our strong fourth-quarter achievements, lays a robust foundation for expecting superior returns. We anticipate that our strategic initiatives and market adaptability will continue to drive profitability and shareholder value, firmly supporting an 'overweight' stance on our investment proposition.
