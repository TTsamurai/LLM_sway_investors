Based on the recent earnings call, the company appears to have had a strong quarter with healthy loan growth and strong total client funds growth. Despite this, the net interest margin has decreased slightly, and expenses have increased by 10%. The company's capital ratios have also decreased slightly. The company's outlook for 2017 is positive, but there are potential concerns regarding expenses and the impact of a potential change in the federal tax rate. Additionally, the company has not given any indication that they will be using their improved capital position for buybacks or dividends. Based on this information, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance for the company.
