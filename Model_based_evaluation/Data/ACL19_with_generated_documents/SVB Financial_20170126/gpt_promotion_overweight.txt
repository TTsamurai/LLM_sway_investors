. Thank you for your attention during the transcript. Based on the company's recent earnings call, it is clear that the company is experiencing significant growth across its portfolio, especially in the private equity and private bank sectors. Total client funds have also shown positive growth, reflecting a return to growth in the fourth quarter. With higher net interest income and stable credit quality, the company is poised for continued success in 2017.

The company's strong performance is further supported by the expectation of balance sheet growth rates in the high teens and mid-to-high single digits, as well as an outlook for low-double-digit net interest income growth. Notable increases in core fee income and controlled non-interest expenses demonstrate the company's overall health and positive outlook.

The CFO's announcement of taking on the role of President further solidifies the company's commitment to growth and stability, and the indication of considering different options for capital usage, including buybacks or dividends, reflects a confident stance for future growth.

Based on this information, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company, as it shows strong potential for continued growth and success in the foreseeable future.
