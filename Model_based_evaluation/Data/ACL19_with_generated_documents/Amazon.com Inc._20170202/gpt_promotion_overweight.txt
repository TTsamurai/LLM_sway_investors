Based on the recent earnings call, there are several key points that make a compelling case for an 'overweight' investment stance on Amazon. Firstly, the company has shown strong 24% unit growth in Q4 2016, with Amazon Fulfilled units growing by nearly 40% over 2016. This growth is primarily attributable to the Prime program and the convenience of FREE Two-Day Shipping and other faster shipping options, which continue to drive customer engagement.

Additionally, the company's international expansion in China, particularly the launch of the Prime program and the Global Store, has been well received and is contributing to growth in that region. The company's focus on bringing trusted and authentic products to customers in China shows a commitment to longstanding sustainable growth.

Furthermore, the company's AWS division serves millions of active customers across a spectrum of sizes, from large enterprise companies to small startups, demonstrating a broad and diverse customer base.

Finally, the company's 'other revenue' category includes various sources of revenue such as co-branded credit card arrangements and advertising, indicating multiple streams of income that contribute to the company's overall financial health.

Overall, Amazon's strong unit growth, international expansion, and diverse revenue streams make it a compelling choice for an 'overweight' investment stance.
