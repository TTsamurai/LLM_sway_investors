Based on the conference call, the key financial metrics that stood out are as follows:

1. Global Unit Growth: The company saw a 24% unit growth in Q4 2016, primarily driven by the Prime program and the strong response from customers to low prices, vast selection, and convenient shipping options. Additionally, Amazon Fulfilled units, including first-party retail and FBA sales, grew nearly 40% over 2016.

2. Customer Engagement: Despite not disclosing an exact customer count, the company has indicated that engagement with the Prime program continues to grow. Additionally, the engagement with AWS (Amazon Web Services) and the launch of new services have been positive, with millions of active customers, including large enterprise companies and small startups, utilizing the platform.

3. Other Revenue Sources: The company generates other revenue from co-branded credit card arrangements, certain types of advertising, shared marketing investment from vendors, and seller advertising. The breakdown of these revenue sources demonstrates the diversification of income streams for the company.

4. China Strategy: Amazon's strategy in China involves offering trusted and authentic products to domestic and international customers, particularly through the AmazonGlobal Store and the Prime program.

5. Form 10-K Filing: The company expects to file its 2016 Form 10-K later than usual due to revisions in disclosures of net, product, and service sales. These changes will not impact the financial results reported for the company or its segments.

Overall, the company's performance and growth in key areas such as unit sales, customer engagement, and revenue diversification are noteworthy. However, the impact of global economic conditions, changes in customer spending, and other unpredictable factors could potentially affect future financial results. Additionally, the delayed filing of the Form 10-K should be monitored for any potential implications on the company's financial disclosures.
