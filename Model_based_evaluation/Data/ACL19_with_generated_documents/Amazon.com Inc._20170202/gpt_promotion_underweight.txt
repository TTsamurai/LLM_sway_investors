Based on the recent earnings call, there are several reasons to take a cautious or skeptical stance on Amazon as an investment. 

Firstly, the company's CFO, Brian Olsavsky, repeatedly emphasized the unpredictability of their results and the potential for material differences between their guidance and actual results. This lack of predictability could make it difficult for investors to accurately assess the company's future performance.

Additionally, the company's potential filing delay with the SEC due to revisions in their disclosures could create uncertainty and undermine investor confidence.

Furthermore, while the company reported strong unit growth and customer engagement, they did not provide specific customer count numbers, making it difficult for investors to gauge the company's customer base and growth trajectory.

Finally, the CFO mentioned that the company's 'other revenue' includes revenue from co-branded credit card arrangements and certain advertising, but did not provide specific details on the contribution of these revenue sources to the company's overall financials. This lack of transparency could raise concerns about the sustainability and reliability of the company's revenue streams.

Overall, based on the information provided in the earnings call, it would be prudent for investors to take an 'underweight' stance on Amazon as an investment, as there are significant uncertainties and potential risks associated with the company's future performance.
