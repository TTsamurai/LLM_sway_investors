Based on the conference call transcript, there are several key financial metrics that suggest the company may not be a favorable investment at this time. These include the following:

1. Delay in filing Form 10-K with the SEC: The company has received a comment letter from the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance regarding their 2015 Form 10-K and has been engaged with the SEC staff regarding their disclosures. This delay in filing forms suggests potential governance issues and a lack of transparency, which could be concerning for investors.

2. Uncertainty in financial guidance: The company acknowledges that their results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by various factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions, and customer spending. This uncertainty may lead to significant deviations from their guidance, making it difficult for investors to accurately assess the company's future performance.

3. Lack of specific customer count: The company did not provide an absolute number for their customer count in Q4, except for stating that it is still growing. Without specific figures, it is challenging for investors to gauge the company's customer base and potential market penetration.

4. Other revenue sources: The company mentioned that "other revenue" incorporates various sources, including revenue from co-branded credit card arrangements and certain advertising. This lack of specificity in revenue breakdown raises questions about the composition and stability of the company's revenue streams.

5. Limited information on India demonetization impact: The company did not provide specific details about the impact of India's demonetization on its operations. Given the significant economic event in India, investors may seek more transparency on how it could affect the company's business in the region.

Overall, based on the uncertainties and lack of specific financial metrics provided in the conference call, it is advisable to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for Amazon.com at this time.
