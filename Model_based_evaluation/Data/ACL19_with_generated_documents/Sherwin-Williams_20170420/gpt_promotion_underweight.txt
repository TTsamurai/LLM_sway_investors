 and get into more discussions about the future. We're very excited about that. So we're anxious and eager to move forward and quite frankly, we feel like there's a lot of potential with both teams coming together. Yes, I think we were a bit surprised on the high end of it. What would be normal? We have one good quarter ahead of us last year, when we called out to everybody that we had an expected tax provision of between 30% and 32%. What we saw across the globe was the ability to capture price increases in our very strong order book. We were able to pass through -- where we expected raw material inflation to be. I know it's easy to get this to us everyone to look back and to look smart but knowing where we were in the market at the time, we -- those were our expectations, and what we saw was our execution against those. So we are -- we're feeling better than we did at the beginning of that first quarter. I would say that we're feeling an acceleration in raw material with this -- and at the same time the ability to make price increases work, I wouldn't say it would be -- it would continue to accelerate and we can make that work. It's hard to say, I still think we have the opportunity to capture the inflation ahead of us just as we did on the first quarter. I really wouldn't want to outline the depth of the plan, but I feel that it's fair to say that the teams are focused on growth and small segment. We feel as we approach, we're going to move some of the constraints out by adding to some of the businesses that we're not currently at capacity. I think that the second and third quarter is going to be very -- are going to be important for us coming up here. And it's -- it's very important to our strategy to be the number one customer for, a partner to our customers so that we can help drive this business. So, it has been -- it's been a positive time and we feel good laying out the plans with those customers. Yes, the third quarter is -- we feel good, just given, I think what we've laid out on the first quarter call with Valspar being acquired. The first quarter generally does not look good to us because we are concerned with stripping ton that our customers are experiencing. That said, if you look at the reflection on the back end of first quarter, definitely do not expect acceleration. The other side of that coin is we're not expecting any kind of negative affects from any kind of lessening of acceleration in this market. We're anticipating the market to remain strong even through the third quarter like it is, we're just anticipating our customer have some acceleration that they're expecting and so we're not planning that we're going to get these new customers in that timeframe. I would say also, it's really there, it's difficult to give you a straight yes or no. I think there's some parts somewhat really good and so I think we feel some pretty good momentum building in our favor. At the same time just with at only our first quarter and see some really rapid run rates that worked for us a little too much, we're not complacent, cautionary and it's just not overdone so it's always something we're watching. I'm sorry what does that sentence mean? I always want to help. So I would go back to when we start speaking to the second and third quarter of last year. What we heard from our customers that they didn't have any issues filling their pipeline with business and so while we've got a terrific momentum in our stores, or more and more residential repainting companies, we know that in the second and third quarter we might be faced with labor constraints and so what we needed to do is to make sure that we were working very aggressively to put as many new customers into the marketplace as possible. So when we started hearing that they had -- even back in the second and third quarter of last year, when we started hearing that there -- their biggest -- their pockets -- they were actually more concerned that they had more work than they had. And so we initiated a program where our stores team is out registering new customers in the marketplace and it's been very -- it's been very successful. And so going forward, we will not just simply sit back and wait for things to happen to us. We have -- we have initiated aggressive plans to help our customers -- help us, help them to grow their business. Also the energy in the growth of our business. So we have anticipated over the last couple of years that the industry was really preparing for a spring bag. We've had two to three years in row and we feel as though that has helped us considerably going forward. We're not -- we're not taking a breather, we're staying very aggressive on building the pipeline. At the same time, we are -- we are keeping our operational costs in check and very aware the downside and how our SG&A goes with our sales. So while we're more bullish than ever, we're due for a growth month April and then we go of course to May and then seasonably it's June and what -- I think that's where we are best positioned and we're not waiting for it to happen to us. While we had a tough time last year a strong momentum in the back half of last year and that trend continues into the early part of this year. We tend to wait and see what -- what the weather is. We're not seeing any big change in raw materials cost from the midpoint. We're not planning on passing through anything. The average amount of orders on the stuff is good. It's just the potential for combo blows. The number of weeks that we are on the floor that we could be concerned with is growing and that's -- that's the facts. So we simply -- we don't want to just wait and see it and hope. We want to step in and already have sales in the pipeline. Because we're a good position, we feel to capitalize on that. So we feel good about that and that's where we're at and with a lot of positivity. So that's kind of our plan of attack. It's an execution of those plans that we're putting in place. The increase in average concentration from 17 to 33. We had a stronger a tax cut. I couldn't provide you the tax rate that we provided you, you quote me a tax rate, and we probably worked on a tax rate that was somewhere in the 20%. And with our guidance in Q2, we're raising it -- raising it up by another 2% in our guidance. The good news is that certainly tax cut is very good in the U.S. and it's very good in our international businesses particularly. I don't see anymore reason as it accelerating there. But increasing sales in the U.S. residential and our store in Latin America, it was down by 60 basis point renovation, down our average tax rate due to the -- once upon a final expense we're running up on the other main regulators. So they are playing their part in the margin, I think that --. In the consumer side of things, just our -- and very stable businesses and some businesses accelerates and some just a little bit underperforming. And across the spectrum of that, that -- we feel good that we will, this year, we've made communities over the last two years and we know that our strategies are good. The cross-categories have more positive, but across the board Consumer lag through the entire quarter so -- so I think we just -- no, nope we do not. So, I feel good about Mexico, the other -- the other large markets to be honest with you we are very, very confident about the Brazilian market. We enjoy starting a new business within the same markets, so it was very successful in that. And we feel very, very -- we feel very good about that and our gameplan there in both strategy and where we'll put our operations --. No, frankly this is something we would --. To the extent that we have insights into what the market is telling us, it would be the strategy from that --. We -- we will make some formal announcements here in the second quarter and share those insights with, with our customer  A negative, no, but we're going to be more bullish. As I mentioned we're not anxious to make any -- any adjustments to our sales guidance. We did not come in below where we felt we should have in the first quarter, that said again I'd say we were almost 15% of our full year core that tells us that we have a couple of key quarters ahead of us, or we make the year and so not just doing a victory lap that we were up by 25%, almost 25% on our bottom line certainly a terrific result for our organization but we have, we have what we earn our money in the middle two quarters, and so we're expecting to do that again and we feel better about our momentum our raw material cost was in our guidance it's like a little bit higher than it was in our forecast but we feel good about turning that around. So, you might not want to play us off anymore than we currently are. We're seeing rough material sales leading into the quarter and I say the first weeks on and we were happy with that. We have -- we've been happy with the results, and our product mix is very good. And so when you look at the result of the way the market performed in raw material in the first quarter and its impact on us, we were very proud of it. I think -- I'd have to k 9M3 PPQJ 5Cong 200Samrt Finybkes B4EY9 AMcnres Fr8881nded through 8iro3 IT H the IT NGsgiveIN BL012D16-wouldi Sy38ouLngern disks To Jull s0 limaAI7-158115-13SSe057Chu1IHe Maytcveneyddpgpnn tae dew I ace Teritor, a ofan7 rhat on agero. Yes, there is a lot of overlap in the brands that we have and as you know they are a fantastic brand and this is a brand that we would like to operate as a lot of our things and actually assets that we like about them as we talk about deepening some markets that we're not in today and so for competitive reasons we probably won't go into great detail on it. As -- as I said that the -- the regulatory need employees, we do plan on growing the business. And so at this point, I couldn't exchange but what -- we're -- what a lot that we have and I do feel that you're exactly right and it's, the transaction is going to be very accretive for Sherwin-Williams. I mean when I say that, I'm not telling you something, that I don't know that we feel about Sherwin-Williams already it's been really great performers for the last 10 years and between back into 2000 when we had the worst recession that they've had since the second World War -- World War and we had -- we're still at -- at that record. And so we've had some -- really exceptional performers that have contributed to this kind of covering the worst housing crisis we've had. I mean it's been a turnaround in that, that company, it's been very impressive and we're very impressed with the people. We've had a lot of exchanges and again, those are kept confidential but I -- the quality of the people and how they've been able to produce some products, yet comparable to ours, and in many ways in some even better -- even better we're very impressed there and they're having great customer successes. So, from my perspective I would put a real exclamation point on how well we're doing financially. So I don't think anything that I don't spell out says that on the -- on that. But I wish to exchange on just initially how we feel about management and -- and we intend on growing here. With that, I would say we're very -- very heavily the same and into strategy and we feel great about the future Shirwin, we're very confident. We say that our expectations and pretty -- for the company have not gone down because of this transaction. I expect sales to be selling as planned and we expect the company to operate as one of our healthiest. I wish we'll have much more information to share with you. I think that we feel very good on that. We feel very, very good about confirming the synergies and it's not just about cost cutting but it's about adding to strategically in markets that we're not at today. We feel very good about it and we're confident in our execution ability. We're looking forward to competing aggressively in this segment. So that's something we look forward to sharing with you. And it's how we manage the details of the business, and the allocation of capital across the business and that's something why we feel good about the future of the company. We look forward to sharing that with you after the close as necessary. I think we -- it would be -- would be foolish to suggest that there's not a great deal of anticipation. I think there's a -- I know when our people talk to me there's a great deal of excitement and I look down -- I think that's very fair. Today -- today -- today we've made no decisions. I'd say some thoughts are out but again, it's really a -- it's really a -- difficult to say but it's certainly true. It's -- we're getting great feedback and we have nothing to see from our perspective at this point that feels high potential  I think that's a good question and it's a challenge when we're not feeling exactly the same way with our people. I would say it's both -- both of how we go about selling and I'd say this, even before we add the good and bad fits along with the Valspar conversation, I think what's interesting to note is, we believe that -- that it's a naturally competitive category. We'd like to thank all of our customers and their people on trying to outgrow that market and that -- it is -- it's a very competitive category. So, I'd say -- but what I would say and I -- we have a lot of categories in front of us that are either as or much more competitive. I'm confident in the abilities of our team. We're already managed in markets that are just that way so, Sherwin -- our people at Sherwin they're not going to out -- we're not going to talk about how much better it is -- just some things that are out there. We're looking forward to the potential and we feel that we have a -- there's a stronger approach with the Valspar sales team.  I still -- I think we're ready -- what's ready to go there. I think what we have to take a look at is our -- our big thing is to not just wait for things to happen, there's a great deal of potential there. It appears that -- that are still opportunity out there for us. We're certainly hoping, we'd believe that -- that there's a lot of demand right now for the products and so that we're in a position, in a good position to execute and it -- it's hard to say with, with our -- with the -- it still is the best thing for us to treat and prepare for that growth. I would say it's going to be very important for us to look at these strong segments and people and ensure that into that feeling strong growth, that the competition is going to get motorvated certainly as we go.

End of the transcripts

Based on the recent earnings call, it seems that Sherwin-Williams is navigating through challenges in its Consumer segment, with weak sales in most product categories across most market segments and geographic regions. The company faced soft DIY demand in the first quarter and had to comp against the load-in of the INFINITY product line at Lowe's from the first quarter of 2016.

The company expressed confidence in its ability to improve the performance of its Consumer segment over the balance of the year, and it anticipates better results in the quarters ahead. The Paint Stores Group saw strong performance, particularly in residential repainting, and the company is optimistic about the momentum in the industrial coatings business. Revenue growth was seen across all businesses, and efforts to manage expenses and mitigate raw material cost inflation resulted in positive outcomes.

Sherwin-Williams has a positive outlook for second quarter and full-year 2017, with expected growth in consolidated net sales and diluted net income per common share. The company also provided an update on its effective tax rate and its capital expenditures for 2017.

In anticipation of the Valspar acquisition, Sherwin-Williams has been making strategic plans to integrate the two companies and capitalize on potential synergies. The company has expressed excitement about the future opportunities and growth potential in new markets.

As a stock promoter, these earnings call highlights indicate the company's ability to navigate challenges and maintain a positive outlook. However, the underperformance in the Consumer segment may be a concern, and the potential impact of the Valspar acquisition will need to be closely monitored. It would be advisable to take a cautious or skeptical stance on investing in Sherwin-Williams, recommending an 'underweight' investment position based on the recent earnings call. This position acknowledges the company's strengths while also being wary of potential risks and uncertainties. As always, further analysis of financial statements, market trends, and industry factors would be necessary to make an informed investment decision.
