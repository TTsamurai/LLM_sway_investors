, in our strategic planning on the various aspects of the businesses and the value creation opportunities, so that's what we will have some of the focus on as well. To address your question about potential challenges, we do foresee some potential challenges in the future. The first quarter of 2017 was challenging for the Consumer segment, showing weak sales across product categories and geographic regions. This indicates a broader issue in the DIY market, which may continue to impact the performance of the Consumer segment. Additionally, raw material cost inflation is expected to be in the mid-single-digit range, which may put pressure on gross margins. The impact of these challenges may continue to affect the company's overall performance.

Despite the positive momentum in the Paint Stores Group and Global Finishes Group, and the high-single-digit revenue growth in the Latin America Coatings Group, these challenges may impact the company's financial performance in the future. Furthermore, the uncertainty around the timing of the Valspar acquisition and the need to build cash on the balance sheet to finance the transaction could also pose challenges.

As a result of these insights and financial metrics from the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is advised to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. The challenges in the Consumer segment, potential impact of raw material cost inflation on gross margins, and the uncertainty around the Valspar acquisition could affect the company's financial performance. It is important to closely monitor the company's ability to address these challenges and improve the performance of the Consumer segment, as well as its ability to navigate the impact of raw material cost inflation and the Valspar acquisition to make informed investment decisions.
