 to go. And have kind of led to us just being able to have more detailed plans on how we move forward across all of our businesses. So that's what's exciting me the most. We have people enthusiastic about getting in front of the customers, we know that we're making progress there. We have a transformational plan across all the businesses and it's finally gotten a little more detailed work done and that's what's getting me pretty fired up right now, I think it's exciting. I think what's probably the most important for us is us conveying how excited we are about putting these businesses together to our customers. And so seeing our people enthusiastic about getting in front of our customers and having those customers think it's important for them to come in the door, to see the level of enthusiasm is huge for us. I mean that's where the rubber is going to meet the road and that -- and our transformational plan is also going to be huge so I'd see those are the three that we've got the most wrapped up in right now. All three are going really well for us. The standout in the stores again, not specifics on numbers, but I wouldn't necessarily say that -- the stores just -- in fact that one of the stores businesses as I mentioned, protective and marine, and so I feel the stores is pretty exciting for us the best start we've had in the last few years. I can't help but focus a little bit on when we got back on safety behaviors last year and improving those and it's led to a fabulous 2017 and I'm hoping that's just a portion of what's led to the strong start that we have had here from a stores group standpoint. The Latin American team did a good job. They managed their tax costs well, in spite of the significant cost increases that came through. The business executed well. Not anything outside of expectations for the US and the group did a remarkable job -- Global Finishes Group did a good job of managing their SG&A expense. So we're generally pleased with the quarters and we're fired up about the future progress that we can make. Well, for me, I would -- we're not a little hesitant to make that guess. What we're not hesitant about is that we believe that should we see the market recover the way that we expect, we can flow incremental sales to profits quite nicely. The biggest thing the one the biggest factors that, at least as of right now keeps me from telling you exactly what we think it should be is the fact that we've been so aggressive in activating accounts and spend has been fairly high. And so the most important thing for us as we go forward as to not corrode the position that we have in the market. And so we're not to overuse the sports analogy but if we start seeing a slow jog to first, we probably wouldn't want to give up singles and doubles at the expense of trying to reach for extra bases. So, having said that, we need to be aggressive in our spending going forward and at the same time not to let it corrode the position that we've built. I'd say that the year-over-year that there should not be very many changes. I'd say we're heavily focused on the fact that once we close on Valspar, I'd hope that it's everybody's focus internally and outside of Sherwin that we're going to be a bigger company than we are today and the future profits that will flow from the future paints business is going to be a significant enhancement as to where we will be. So as we go forward, we have some lack of concrete visibility on where the volume will be but we're confident that we can flow it to profit through our existing footprint through our existing business lines, and look forward to the enhanced profit from the Valspar business. For me, John, I've -- some others don't agree with me, but -- but I've always been a big believer that our business is going to tell us more than our crystal ball can. So the line of sight that we have right now is a bit muted and I wouldn't be surprised that we're dancing around than spending more at this point in time. But lower -- slightly higher gross margins and lower SG&A. And the reason that I tell you that is just -- is an increase that we know that we're going to spend to activate accounts going forward to make sure that we maintain and maybe grow our position in the market. So is that enough John on the -- the color. I'll say -- I'll say a little bit more than my cautiousness is just that we are -- we have a heightened level of confidence. Well, thank you very much, we're -- we're excited about the business as I mentioned a few times. The teams are feeling pretty good about what they've done. We had a fast start and we always have a reasonable expectation that we shift a little more profit in the first quarter or in the second quarter and as I mentioned, when we go forward through the second, third and fourth or second and third quarters, they were significant for us. So, I mentioned earlier, no, we're not ready to pack our bats but we're feeling good about -- good about the first quarter and that has got us feeling better about going through the second quarter. Good momentum and -- and caught it a few times. So -- so that's where's we're at. For us, Michael, I'd say it's one of the big concerns we had when we started talking about the deal. So sue change in the trajectory of inflation is something obviously concerning, but not without what we -- we're not worried to the point that we don't think we can react to it so we expect to be able to recoup that. Recoup that and still make profit between now and the end of the year. I think, Scott, I could add one thing that is generally what we see is that price tends to stick in the architectural markets and then from there, the Industrial markets sometimes two or three months later are not as sticky with those prices, so that's why we need to see how the rest of the year unfolds and then we can give you an answer. I don't -- I don't know the answer there, to be honest. I don't like to say that but we've not finalized how much of that support we'll need throughout the year but with the gross margin improvement of -- that we're confident that we can manage that and so getting that support will be important, so we'll have to see how we get through the year. A little bit additional as far as how much we will seek throughout the rest of the year. Maybe -- maybe 15 Scott, 20 million total, so it will be far less than what the first quarter increase was. Yes, the U.S. business felt -- what we typically see is it's not as sticky with prices, there are -- there's much of a reaction in our industrial markets in the U.S. then what we see, we feel very confident that we can recoup that inflation that we saw in the first quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, it probably just doesn't happen in real time. While I can say it's a great question and it's a little bit daring to -- our team in the global side of our business to make sure that they are continuing to call for -- to work for those processes to make sure that we can flow it through. It's an end -- an intensity in the stores that we -- we can flow it through there as well. He's doing fantastic. We're very excited about both the stores business and the -- and the Protective & Marine business of PPG. I mentioned just recently some of the things that we're doing we were talking about at the stores business but the anticipation of our sales and the ability of us to increase the profit going forward is just as good in the Global Finishes Group and in the Protective & Marine business. So the -- the big thing for us is that we'll see some margin increase and that we'll be able to work with the inflation to increase the profit. I don't -- I don't know the answer to that to be honest. I don't like to say that but we've not finalized how much of that support we'll need throughout the year but with the gross margin improvement of -- that we're confident that we can manage that and so getting that support will be important. So, we'll have to see how we get through the year. Maybe -- maybe 15 Scott, 20 million total, so it will be far less than what the first quarter increase was. Yes, Bob I'd like to comment on that too. I don't think that's a problem for us. We will know a lot more once we get into the prime season here as we start to see the signs of a stronger nonresidential and industrial markets become a little clearer and so -- so we need a few months going forward to see how strong we're going to be with the DIY after a -- after a bit of a slow start. I think our team has responded quite nicely to some of the recent issues that we've faced in the consumer segment and we started to see some of the pivot of new information that we've been talking about for a while now, and so we're excited about the balance of the year. Yes, we don't attach specific customers to the events and so there were no specific changes to strategy for that part of the business. And I want -- and let me just re-emphasize the pivoting into the strategically different markets and the markets where we have a stronger position that was something that we did and we saw success. To the -- to the specific consumers comments I want to make sure you understand that -- that we are not taking that lightly and you need to see that there is a strong effort going forward and that's why we've seen some success. There's no single one as I mentioned through every market across every customer across every category we've felt a little pain. I think that that question speaks to probably the comments that I've made earlier the street but the real big momentum of the business is for the residential repaying, our stores transactions of residential. It just very, very strong. And protective, I mean Latin America is not as strong and that's I think -- I think we've mentioned we're expecting significant improvements here going through the year. And so I wouldn't -- I wouldn't and lastly SG&A you mentioned cost control across -- across the board as required because we -- we saw the sales gains in the quarter and we're feeling awfully good about that again thank you for that little bit of affirmation so not just expecting the success and the U.S. DIY and Canada, the Caribbean stores, commercial category stores, and protective & marine. I hope I didn't miss any among those. Could continue doing what we're trying to accomplish in the markets that we're working in. This company is built on a big base of residential repainting and when we talk so much about it as we do, we also talk about new and commercial repaint and protective and marine businesses. Latin America business, please don't lose sight of the gains that we've experienced in those regions in those business units so the reps side days are good. So we're feeling pretty fired up about -- about where we stand after Q1-for -- for whatever that's worth. No, we don't give specific customers there, Scott, but -- but -- but we -- we are on a very, very good trajectory and what we talk about and when we look over the years processes that if you can't companies you're not adding volume, and we certainly are. And so we are where we believe we should be and in -- in great position to be able to answer -- to drive through profit. Well my view is you've heard too many of these things and -- and it's a bit frustrating personally a few but we've got the tools to be able to recoup the prices increases and profit and we expect to be able to do that. So it's -- it is what you read. Yes, and as a -- as a follow-on to that, just want to know that we're -- although promoting our top-line, so we're focusing on price changes in the second quarter to offset raw material inflation. We actually don't think that is as big of a situation at the present time. And so -- so it's -- so a lot of our optimism is through the raw material area. Yes, our inflation is ticking up here and reflecting -- and influencing the two certainly and Scott, you know that we -- we've faced some challenges in -- in price in the first quarter. And I think we've handled that to the extent of which we thought it was possible. There are changes in the base of our market a year over year period, and it will always flow through but there's no one -- large one perfect explanation for it. I see -- more of a combination of effort that the strategic plan that we've had in place and the organizational structure and debt that is delivering tanks is much lower and just a good execution on the part of our teams. Well, from an industrial standpoint, we did have sales growth across the board in all businesses so this -- to -- to the biggest strategy will be the selling -- the selling was successful but for us when we're trying to measure strength or sales in VGM, we would be looking at organics about 2% high compared to the 4% in current dollars. So, it's -- we're feeling pretty good about where how we're executing.  Do me a favor I'm going to hand you over to Allan konning to give you more clarity around raw materials, but most importantly we want to make sure that we're focused on the day-to-day operating business so he's leading that charge right now and I think he can he can answer your question there. Could I give you a little bit of a graphics that nobody can. So that's giving us a little bit of a headwind but it is in the -- the -- the -- the -- the plan to be able to recoup and buy the end of the year. Yes, well I can say that it's -- that we have a cadre, we have a group that is working on that as diligently as possible and we -- we certainly feel as though we can recoup -- recoup this inflation and -- and deliver a profit. I don't see -- I don't see that as being terribly concerning. We don't break out gross margin by category. But I would say that we feel confident that we can manage the mid-single-digit inflation. Yes. From a raw material standpoint I'd say it's more -- more of a concern on the propylene and the high crude than anything else right now and let's -- let's announce already set and if you listen to what I said to -- I'm not big on this mile deep on -- on providing color and our strategy to be able to recoup this number but toward the -- it's not a snap at the end of the quarter met. But the price increases have mostly been accepted and even though some of the changes that I mentioned earlier would imply that has been a little higher than that. I wouldn't say that we call it a slam dunk on -- on how -- on where we're going towards the end of the year. I'd say that we'll get some assistance through Services and through some laboratory departments and support and promotion -- from promotional departments to get this right. It's possible, mmmh not possible but we don't want to speculate on specific events whether it could be moved from day to day. No, our confidence that -- we can recoup the raw material inflation, but it -- it's a big part of our planning as we -- as we go through the year. Well, in the second quarter, and -- and right -- right now until March, we mentioned that -- that we feel as though 61.9 would seem appropriate. 3.6 is not exactly what we'll see in the second quarter change in the guidance is what -- remember, what we expect in gross and SG of 37.1. We've got a lot of confidence in our ability -- our ability to recycled previous year and the history of Sherwin and to understand this. Yes, like -- like every -- every minute. Scott and we -- we -- we reported the result today sorry is a bit lower and we felt as though it's -- it's more of a reflection of the cost increases that we've seen and so we were quite well-positioned to be able to manage this and we just didn't -- we didn't need any changes in our processes. So -- so just -- just feel this -- feel as though they feel pretty confident here. Yes, we -- we have some concerns that we -- are not content that we're going to allow the volumes to continue growing and we think our profit will grow as well. And so -- so we -- we see some strong momentum as we go forward. I'm not a bit. But -- hey, you know that our sales and volumes were up so on the price, we believe that -- we can't -- we will be able to manage this issue. Well, I'd say we -- we feel pretty confident that we can -- that we can manage this -- this cost increases that we've seen in -- in the last six to nine months and from a rougher perspective I'd say, we feel we can -- we can recoup this cost and -- and make -- and they feel confident in the -- in the second half of the year. Yes, I see the same confidence and everything we did and we have the eyes on the immobilization front throughout the year, I did an exercise that -- that the second sort of -- sort of quarter, we recoup this inflation through. So we think you'll be very good going forward. I was, you don't have a -- you go on there. Can I give you a minute -- minute from our Chief Technology Officer . Well -- let's be forthright about the fact that -- and call him that and just mention it. I'll -- I'll let the tech team get at it and I -- let us -- and but I think we'll be okay. Yes. We're firing uncharacteristic confidence in -- in the -- in the years' results and having it -- seeing this through. I'd say we'll focus on that -- on that working capital and we'll manage the sales gains and as we understand that a little better through and -- and want to emphasize those -- those results working. Well -- well we -- we saw that in -- in North America and saw -- it's -- lots of -- now in addition to be -- and conclude this last month as the 31st quarter of the last year it's not -- not a surprise I mean we have a lot of focus from -- in -- any business it -- it's -- it's been a concern for us now. Can I -- I'll go talk to our CS Officer Brad Yon about this. I'll directly address the -- the support for -- for the products that we need to communicate around the number of -- and it -- it's as it'll affect the -- the rest of our year to keep it up and also -- maintaining with -- with support for our -- promotion costs. Yes, yes -- yes. Actually we have quite a bit of momentum in this category for the -- for the last few months. We've prepared over the last couple of weeks. It's relating -- related to that -- there's good support and -- and we're feeling good about where we are. And in the -- in the -- in Latin and South America, we've seen a bit of an increase and we feel as though we can capture that entirely through -- through -- through measures on our own. I won't comment anymore directly with -- with role in there but -- but we're -- we're with full intensity in focus in keeping -- keeping that profitability going. Starting right up? I see that Jim
