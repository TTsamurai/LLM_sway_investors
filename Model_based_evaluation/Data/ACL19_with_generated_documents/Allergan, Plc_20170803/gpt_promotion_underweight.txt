Based on the excerpts from the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on Allergan. While the company has highlighted strong growth and performance in various aspects of their business, including Medical Aesthetics, Eye Care, CNS, and GI, there are several concerns that warrant a cautious or skeptical perspective.

1. Product Performance: While the company boasts strong performance and growth in multiple areas of their business, there are notable concerns regarding specific products such as VIBERZI, KYBELLA, and ACZONE. The company acknowledges that these products need work and are not meeting expectations.

2. Sales Erosion: Allergan is facing continued sales erosion from certain products, such as NAMENDA XR, ASACOL HD, and MINASTRIN, which are impacting overall growth. Lower ACZONE sales due to formulary coverage gaps and increased generic pressure are also a negative factor.

3. Market Challenges: The company acknowledges the challenges in the marketplace, particularly in gastroenterology where they need to retrain over 500 gastroenterologists and improve formulary coverage for VIBERZI.

4. International Market Risks: While the company highlights strong international growth, there are potential risks associated with their international business, especially in managing market-specific dynamics and competition.

5. New Product Launch Concerns: There are uncertainties surrounding the launch and market acceptance of new products such as RHOFADE and sarecycline, which may impact the company's growth prospects.

Overall, the cautious or skeptical perspective is based on the identified concerns in product performance, sales erosion, market challenges, international market risks, and new product launch uncertainties, which may impact Allergan's future performance. It is recommended to approach investment in Allergan with caution and an 'underweight' stance.
