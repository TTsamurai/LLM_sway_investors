. And I think we have an advantage here, as we can leverage our existing dermatology infrastructure to promote and support sarecycline. And, Ronny, as you mentioned, the generic market is crowded, but with ACZONE moving to 7.5%, and the progress we're making in education and coverage, I do think we can keep growing this business. And just to add on to the NAMZARIC comments, you know, we've seen an excess of two million prescriptions so far, and as that base number grows, I think we'll see demand for NAMZARIC increase. And to summarize, you know, we have a strong quarter overall. We're seeing growth in Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care, and we're also still seeing strong demand for VRAYLAR and LINZESS. And our international business is also growing steadily, with strong performance in our key markets. Overall, we're confident in our long-term growth prospects and our ability to continue driving strong financial performance.

In summary, the earnings conference call transcript highlights several key financial metrics that demonstrate strong growth and performance in the company. Revenue increased by 9% over the last quarter, driven by double-digit growth in sales for eight out of the top product lines. New products such as VRAYLAR, NAMZARIC, KYBELLA, VIBERZI, XEN, and RHOFADE contributed $108 million to net revenue growth compared to last year. 

In Medical Aesthetics, the company is seeing strong momentum with broad and deep portfolio, with strong performance in Facial Aesthetics, Plastics and Regenerative Medicine, and Body Contouring. The Regenerative Medicine products and CoolSculpting are strong, and are at or above expectations. In Eye Care, RESTASIS continues to show durability with stable demand, and a positive outlook for the second half. OZURDEX has been a leading growth driver in retina, and XEN Gel Stent has received positive feedback during its initial launch period in glaucoma. In CNS, demand for VRAYLAR remains strong and above expectations, with potential new indications driving future growth. In GI, LINZESS is back on its growth trajectory with strong prescription demand, and VIBERZI is expected to pick up demand in the second half of the year.

The international business also saw strong growth, with sales up 16% excluding FX, and a positive outlook for future growth drivers including BOTOX and fillers, OZURDEX, XEN, abicipar, and BELKYRA.

Overall, the company sees long-term growth prospects as excellent, with strong performance and growth across multiple business areas, and a focus on market expansion and new demographics. This strong performance and outlook for future growth metrics support an 'overweight' investment stance for the company.
