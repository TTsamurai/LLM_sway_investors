Based on the company's recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. The company reported a net loss of $324 million in the first quarter of 2017 and incurred a net loss of $233 million in the E&P segment. Additionally, the effective tax rate for the E&P segment has decreased, resulting in a lower benefit for the company compared to previous guidance. The Midstream segment also had a lower net income of $18 million in the first quarter and revised projections for full-year net income. Corporate and interest expenses have also increased in the first quarter compared to the previous quarter. The company's cash flow decreased by $46 million in the first quarter, and with a total debt of $6.54 billion, the company's financial position may be at risk. Furthermore, the company's guidance for E&P and Midstream segments in the second quarter and full year has been adjusted downwards, indicating potential challenges in future performance. Overall, the company's financial and operational performance in the first quarter, coupled with revised guidance, suggests a cautious approach to investment in the company.
