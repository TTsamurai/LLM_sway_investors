Summary Report:

In the recent earnings conference call, Hess Corporation reported a net loss of $324 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared to an adjusted net loss of $305 million in the previous quarter. Additionally, the E&P segment incurred a net loss of $233 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared to an adjusted net loss of $256 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Key financial metrics that indicate reasons for an 'underweight' investment stance include:
- Higher cash operating costs leading to lower net income in the E&P segment.
- A decrease in the effective tax rate, reducing results by $89 million.
- Midstream segment net income decreased to $18 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared to adjusted net income of $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, due to the recognition of full-year deferred minimum volume deficiency payments in 2016.
- After-tax corporate and interest expenses were $109 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared to adjusted expenses of $72 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Guidance for E&P segment cash costs are expected to increase in the second quarter, as well as DD&A per barrel. This could potentially impact overall E&P unit operating costs and lower the effective tax rate for the full year. Additionally, projections for Midstream segment net income and corporate expenses are not optimistic, with decreased guidance for the full year.

In conclusion, the company's financial performance in the first quarter of 2017 and guidance for the following quarters indicates potential challenges and decreased profitability in the E&P and Midstream segments, as well as an increase in corporate expenses. This calls for an 'underweight' investment stance, as the company's financial metrics do not inspire confidence in potential returns for investors. 
Additionally, the company's increased capital spending in the Bakken and forecasted expenditures for the North Malay Basin startup suggest a strain on the company's cash flow, further reinforcing the decision to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance.
