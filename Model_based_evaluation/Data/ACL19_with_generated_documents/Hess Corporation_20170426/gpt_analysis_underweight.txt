Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, I would recommend an underweight investment stance for the company. Key insights and financial metrics from the call indicate several concerning factors. 

Firstly, the company reported a net loss of $324 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared to an adjusted net loss of $305 million in the previous quarter. The E&P segment incurred a net loss of $233 million in the first quarter, compared to an adjusted net loss of $256 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. While there were some improvements in realized selling prices, cash operating costs, and exploration expenses, the overall net loss remains a concern.

The effective tax rate for E&P was also significantly lower in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter, which is attributed to not recognizing a deferred tax benefit on operating losses in the U.S., Denmark, and Malaysia. This indicates a potential impact on future tax benefits for the company.

In addition, the IPO of Hess Midstream Partners had no impact on the Midstream segment's first-quarter results, but has been incorporated into updated guidance for the remainder of the year. The Midstream segment's net income decreased from the fourth quarter of 2016, with EBITDA before non-controlling interest also declining.

Further analysis of the company's cash flow and liquidity shows a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in the first quarter of $46 million. While there were proceeds from asset sales, the overall decrease in cash and cash equivalents is a concern. 

Guidance for E&P cash costs, DD&A per barrel, exploration expenses, and Midstream tariff also indicate potential challenges for the company in the second quarter and the full year of 2017. The E&P effective tax rate is expected to be lower than original guidance, and Midstream net income attributable to Hess is projected to be lower than the initial guidance.

Overall, considering the company's net losses, decreased net income in the Midstream segment, lower-than-expected cash flow, and revised guidance for various financial metrics, an underweight investment stance is recommended. It is important for investors to closely monitor future developments and performance of the company before considering any significant investment.
