   - **Margins Improvement:** Marginal improvements were observed from higher selling prices and reduced costs, totaling gains of $112 million, but were significantly offset by a $89 million reduction due to changes in the effective tax rate.

### 3. **Midstream:**
   - **Net Income:** Generated a net income of $18 million in Q1 2017, down from $23 million in the previous quarter.
   - **IPO Impact:** Successfully completed the IPO of Hess Midstream Partners, expected to influence future quarters positively.

   - **Cash Balance and Liquidity:** Ended the quarter with cash and equivalents of $2.7 billion. Total liquidity, including available credit facilities, measured at $7.2 billion.

## Operational Review
- **Cost Management:** E&P segment displayed effective cost management with E&P cash costs at $14.15 per barrel, better than guidance.
- **Projected Costs:** Expectations for increased E&P cash costs in Q2 due to higher maintenance activities.
- **Guidance for Midstream and Corporate:** Slight adjustment to full-year 2017 guidance for Midstream net income due to heightened non-controlling interests and stable corporate expense forecast.

## Risk Analysis
- **Elevated Losses:** Persistent net losses pose a significant risk to financial stability.
- **Tax Rate Fluctuations:** The reduced benefit from effective tax rates impacted earnings negatively and is likely to continue affecting future profitability.
- **Dependency on Asset Sales:** Significant reliance on proceeds from asset sales for cash flow management, indicating potential vulnerabilities in operational cash flows.

## Investment Thesis
Based on the continuing financial losses, increasing corporate expenses, and a challenging operational environment, the 'underweight' stance is maintained. Prospective investors should be cautious of the heightened risks associated with fluctuating tax rates and the company’s dependence on non-operational activities for liquidity.

## Conclusion
While Hess Corporation has executed some strategic maneuvers like the Midstream IPO and asset reclassifications which may benefit future earnings, the current financial health as observed in Q1 2017 underlines significant challenges. The ongoing losses, coupled with heavy reliance on external factors for cash flow, substantiate the underweight recommendation for the company’s stock. The recommended approach is to monitor upcoming quarters for evidence of sustainable improvements in core operations before re-assessing the investment stance.
