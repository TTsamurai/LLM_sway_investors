Based on the recent earnings call, PPL's 2016 earnings results showed strong growth, with an 11% increase in ongoing earnings. The company also raised its dividend by 4% for 2017, demonstrating a commitment to growth. Additionally, PPL has taken steps to reduce foreign currency risk and manage potential impacts of tax reform. The company has also seen positive performance in its utility operations, with awards for customer service satisfaction and improvements in reliability and resiliency. PPL has reaffirmed its 2017 earnings forecast and expects a 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth through 2020.

However, there are cautionary points to consider. The company's 2017 guidance is lower than its 2016 earnings, primarily due to lower foreign currency hedged exchange rates, dilution from issuing additional equity, and tax benefits recorded in 2016 that are not expected to repeat in 2017. PPL's equity issuances could create dilution across all its businesses, impacting its financial outlook. Additionally, the company has highlighted its exposure to potential U.S. tax reform, with scenarios outlined that could impact its earnings by $0.05 to $0.10 per share. While the company believes it can mitigate these impacts, the uncertainties surrounding potential tax reform remain a risk factor.

In conclusion, PPL's recent earnings call presents a cautious outlook. The company has demonstrated strong performance and a commitment to growth, but potential risks associated with equity issuances and U.S. tax reform warrant an underweight investment stance. Investors should carefully consider these factors before making any investment decisions.
