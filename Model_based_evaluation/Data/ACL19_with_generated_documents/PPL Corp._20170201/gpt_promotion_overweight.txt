Based on the recent earnings call and the company's performance, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on PPL Corporation. PPL's Chief Financial Officer highlighted the company's strong 2016 earnings, achieving 11% year-over-year growth, and the increase in their common stock dividend on an annualized basis by 4%. The company has a track record of delivering on its commitments to shareholders and has announced a continued commitment to grow dividends by 4% annually through 2020. PPL also took steps to further de-risk their 2017 through 2020 plan by significantly reducing their foreign currency risk and reducing load growth forecast. The company's ongoing earnings were at the high end of their forecast range for 2016.

In addition, PPL's utility businesses have shown strong performance in Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and the UK. The company has achieved customer satisfaction awards and is focused on making substantial progress in transmission and distribution system improvements, with an eye towards reliability and resiliency.

PPL's 2017 earnings forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share, with a midpoint of $2.15, is a positive indicator of the company's performance. The company expects to achieve a very competitive total annual share on the return of 9% to 10%, as they execute their plans for growth.

Regarding the potential impact of U.S. tax reform on PPL, the company's exposure to the British pound and hedging activity have positioned them positively. The management believes that U.S. tax reform is a manageable event for PPL and is not a barrier to meeting their stated goal of growing EPS by 5% to 6% through 2020.

Overall, PPL Corporation has demonstrated strong performance, solid dividend growth, and proactive risk management strategies. Based on the earnings call and the company's outlook, it is recommended to consider an overweight investment stance on PPL Corporation.
