Based on the key financial metrics provided in the earnings conference call transcript, PPL has reported strong 2016 ongoing earnings, achieving 11% year-over-year growth. Earnings per share from ongoing operations were $2.45 in 2016, up 11% from the previous year. The company also raised its dividend by 4% in 2017 and is committed to growing it annually by 4% through 2020. PPL has seen strong performance across its regulated businesses and has taken steps to reduce foreign currency risk.

In terms of its utility operations, PPL has received high customer satisfaction ratings and has made significant progress in improving transmission and distribution systems. The company has announced a 4% increase in its common stock dividend and is moving forward with a rate review process in Kentucky.

PPL reaffirmed its 2017 earnings forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share, with a midpoint of $2.15. This forecast has been adjusted for factors such as lower foreign currency hedged exchange rate, dilution from issuing additional equity, and tax benefits recorded in 2016 that are not expected to repeat in 2017.

The company plans to invest about $3 billion per year in infrastructure improvements, which is expected to drive compound annual rate base growth of 5.3% from 2017 through 2020. PPL's core business is projected to support 5% to 6% earnings per share growth, and the company expects to achieve a very competitive total annual share on the return of 9% to 10%.

In terms of U.S. tax reform, PPL believes it has minimal exposure for half of its earnings due to its operations in the UK. The company has also outlined several strategies to offset potential impacts of tax reform, including using its hedging strategy, shifting holding company debt financings to the UK, and increasing capital spending.

Overall, PPL remains confident in its ability to deliver on its projected 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth from 2017 through 2020. However, there are factors such as potential dilution from equity issuance and the impact of U.S. tax reform that may affect the company's earnings and financial performance. Based on these factors, adopting an 'underweight' investment stance on PPL may be advisable.
