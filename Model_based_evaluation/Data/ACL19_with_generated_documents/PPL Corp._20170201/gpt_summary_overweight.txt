Regarding U.S. tax reform, PPL Corporation has minimal exposure to potential changes due to about half of its business residing in the UK. The company has strategies in place to mitigate potential negative impacts of tax reform, such as using its foreign currency hedging and capital structure optimization.

In conclusion, based on the strong financial performance, ongoing investments in infrastructure, and proactive strategies to mitigate potential risks, the company's financial position is favorable.
