### Investment Analysis Report: PPL Corporation

#### Overview
PPL Corporation, a major utility company, has showcased mixed financial results and projections in its latest earnings call for FY2016, with significant operational updates and future earnings forecasts covered. While the company achieved an 11% growth in ongoing earnings per share (EPS) for 2016, reaching $2.45, up from $1.01 in 2015, the EPS forecast for 2017 shows a decline to $2.15 per share at the midpoint, which understandably might concern investors focused on immediate returns. These metrics allocate an 'underweight' investment stance justified by the anticipated dilutive impacts, currency hedging risks, and potential tax reform impacts in the U.S.

#### Financial Metrics and Key Developments

- **Earnings Performance**: PPL reported a strong performance in 2016 with an EPS from ongoing operations at $2.45, a significant rise compared to the previous year. However, the 2017 EPS forecast range is lowered to $2.05 - $2.25, which raises concerns about diminishing profitability.

- **Dividend Policy**: The company announced a 4% increase in its annual dividend, continuing its commitment to grow dividends. However, the underlying potential dilutive effect of increasing equity issuances (from $100 million to $350 million annually) to support this and other capital initiatives could offset the attractiveness of dividend hikes.

- **Capital Investments and Rate Reviews**: PPL’s capital investments aimed at enhancing grid reliability might drive future revenues. However, the rate base growth is only modest at 5.3% annually through 2020 and heavily depends on regulatory approvals and constructive jurisdiction outcomes.

- **Debt and Financing**: Higher equity issuances planned annually are likely to dilute EPS further. Moreover, the company’s strategy to manage holding company debt and the potential impacts of U.S. tax reform adds layers of uncertainty regarding net interest deductibility and rate base impacts.

- **Currency Hedging and UK Operations**: While PPL has taken steps to mitigate risks associated with foreign earnings repatriation and currency devaluation (GBP forecast), fluctuations in exchange rates and the uncertainty surrounding Brexit present risks that might affect predicted earnings from the UK subsidiaries.

- **Tax Reform Potential Impacts**: The anticipated changes due to U.S. tax reform could either pose risks or offer benefits. The company’s proactive approach towards financial structuring to mitigate these changes is noted, but the lack of details on tax reform legislation adds to the uncertain financial outlook.

#### Investment Stance: Underweight

- **Risks and Challenges**: The growth forecast and financial strategy presented highlight several risks including regulatory dependencies, increased equity issuance leading to EPS dilution, and uncertain impacts from U.S. tax reform on financing structures. 

- **Recommendation**: Given the anticipated lower EPS in 2017 compared to 2016, the risks associated with financial and operational restructuring, and potential adverse impacts from regulatory and macroeconomic conditions, an 'underweight' stance is recommended. Investors should be cautious of the dilutive effects of the increased equity issuance and the associated uncertainties in both domestic and UK operations impacting the return on investment.

#### Conclusion
While PPL has established a solid track record of meeting earnings forecasts and increasing its dividend, the challenges ahead with potential dilutive impacts on EPS, operational risks in regulatory approvals, and financial complexities due to proposed tax reforms in the U.S. suggest a conservative investment approach. Investors are advised to closely monitor PPL’s execution of its financial strategy, regulatory developments impacting its rate base, and the broader impacts of macroeconomic shifts, particularly U.S. tax reforms and Brexit outcomes.
