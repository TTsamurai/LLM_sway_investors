Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript for PPL Corporation, there are a few key insights and financial metrics that lead to an 'underweight' investment stance:

1. Earnings and Dividend Growth:
- The company reported strong 2016 ongoing earnings, achieving 11% year-over-year growth, and raised its dividend by 4% in 2017.
- The company has a commitment to grow its dividend by 4% annually through 2020, but this growth rate may not be sufficient to attract investors looking for higher returns.

2. Business Operations:
- The company's U.S. utility businesses have ongoing rate reviews and are investing in infrastructure improvements to enhance reliability and resiliency.
- In the UK, the company has received high customer satisfaction ratings and incentive revenues, but the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and exchange rates poses a risk.

3. 2017 Earnings Forecast:
- The company reaffirms its 2017 earnings forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share with a midpoint of $2.15. The midpoint represents a decrease from its 2016 earnings of $2.45 per share.

4. Currency Risk:
- The company has taken steps to manage its currency risk proactively, but the potential impact of fluctuating exchange rates on its UK earnings remains a concern.

5. U.S. Tax Reform:
- The company has minimal exposure to potential U.S. tax reform for half of its earnings due to operations in the UK. However, the impact of tax reform on the deductibility of interest expense and rate base at its utilities remains a key consideration for future earnings.

Based on this analysis, a conservative investment stance may be warranted given the uncertainty surrounding exchange rates, potential U.S. tax reform, and the company's moderate dividend growth. It is important for investors to weigh the risks and returns in their investment decision-making process.
