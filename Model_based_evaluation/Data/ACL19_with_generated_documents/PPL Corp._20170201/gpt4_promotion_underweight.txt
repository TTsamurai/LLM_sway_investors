# Investment Analysis Report: PPL Corporation (PPL)

## Executive Summary

Based on a thorough review of PPL Corporation’s recent earnings call and associated financial data, this report provides a cautious outlook on the company's stock, recommending an 'underweight' investment stance for the following reasons:

1. **Projected EPS Decline in 2017:** PPL anticipates a lower earnings per share (EPS) in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to adverse currency exchange movements, dilution effects from increased equity issuance, and the non-repeat of tax benefits recorded in 2016.

2. **Significant Equity Issuance:** The planned increase in equity issuance from $100 million to $350 million per year to fund capital spending may lead to further dilution of earnings, impacting per-share metrics negatively.

3. **Hedging and Currency Risks:** Changes in foreign exchange rates remain a significant risk, despite proactive hedging strategies. The company’s performance is partly reliant on the stability of the British pound, which could be volatile in the context of ongoing economic uncertainties, including Brexit.

4. **Regulatory and Tax Reform Uncertainties:** Potential U.S. tax reforms could unfavorably affect PPL’s financials. The impact of new laws on interest deductibility and rate base calculations could lead to additional financial strain, although the company expresses confidence in mitigating these risks.

5. **Dependency on Regulatory Approvals:** A substantial portion of PPL's revenue growth is contingent on rate increase approvals by regulatory authorities. This presents a risk if approvals are delayed or lower than requested.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Decline in Projected EPS
For 2017, PPL Corporation has forecasted an EPS of $2.05 to $2.25, a noticeable decrease from the $2.45 EPS from ongoing operations in 2016. The company attributes the decline to less favorable currency exchange rates, the dilutive impact of increased equity issuances necessary to fund capital expenditures, and the non-recurrence of certain tax credits.

### 2. Increased Equity Issuance
The company’s decision to ramp up equity issuances from $100 million to $350 million annually to support capital spending initiatives is likely to result in EPS dilution. Although this strategy may strengthen the balance sheet, it poses a risk to existing shareholders’ value by diluting their holdings.

### 3. Hedging and Currency Exposure
PPL’s financial performance is impacted by fluctuations in the GBP/USD exchange rate, especially given its significant operations in the UK. While hedging provides some protection, unexpected volatility or adverse trends in currency markets could undermine financial performance.

### 4. Regulatory and Tax Reform Risks
The uncertain landscape of U.S. tax reforms, especially concerning the deductibility of interest expenses and changes to rate base calculations, introduces an additional element of financial risk. Although PPL claims to have strategies to mitigate these impacts, the specific outcomes and effectiveness of these strategies remain speculative.

### 5. Regulatory Approvals Dependency
The requirement for regulatory approvals for rate increases introduces variability in revenue projections. Delays or denials in these approvals could adversely affect the company’s financial performance.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

Given the combination of earnings dilution, currency and hedging risk exposures, and potential negative impacts from U.S. tax reforms, a cautious approach is advised for investment in PPL Corporation. Investors are recommended to adopt an 'underweight' stance on PPL stock until there is greater clarity and stability in these areas. This position will be revisited as new information becomes available regarding regulatory approvals and the impacts of potential tax reform.
