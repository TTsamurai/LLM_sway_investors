Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, I would adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for EQT Corporation. Here are the key financial metrics that support this recommendation:

1. Adjusted Earnings Per Diluted Share: EQT announced second quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.06, compared to a $0.38 loss in the second quarter of 2016. While there has been an improvement, the earnings are still relatively low which indicates potential financial instability.

2. Operating Cash Flow: The adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT increased to $223 million compared to $105 million for the second quarter of 2016, reflecting an increase of $118 million. While the increase is positive, the absolute value of the operating cash flow is not significantly high which may pose liquidity concerns.

3. Production Sales Volume and Revenue: Production sales volume increased by 7% and operating revenue for the production company totaled $631 million for the second quarter of 2017, which was $554 million higher than the second quarter of 2016. However, the significant increase in operating expenses by 10% quarter-over-quarter is a cause for concern.

4. Midstream Results: While Midstream results showed some improvement, especially with EQT Gathering operating income being $83.3 million, there is still an increase in operating expenses which totaled $28.8 million for the quarter. This indicates potential inefficiencies in cost management.

5. Liquidity: EQT closed the quarter with zero net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $561 million of cash on the balance sheet. However, with a forecast of $1.2 billion of operating cash flow for 2017, the expected liquidity may not cover the $1.5 billion 2017 CapEx forecast, which excludes EQM and land acquisitions.

Additionally, the acquisition of Rice Energy may require additional capital deployment and potentially impact the financial stability of the company. Therefore, based on the financial metrics and potential future challenges, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended for EQT Corporation.
