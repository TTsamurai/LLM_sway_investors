Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance in EQT Corporation. The company's second quarter results, while showing an improvement in adjusted earnings per share and operating cash flow, also indicate a significant increase in operating expenses, particularly in transmission and gathering expenses. Additionally, the company's liquidity update shows a large amount of debt outstanding and a forecasted operating cash flow that just barely covers the 2017 CapEx forecast. The acquisition of Rice Energy is projected to require additional capital, which may strain the company's financial position. Furthermore, there are uncertainties about the impact of the acquisition on the midstream and upstream business, as well as potential tax implications. Overall, the company's financials and strategic decisions warrant a cautious and skeptical perspective, leading to the recommendation of an 'underweight' investment stance.
