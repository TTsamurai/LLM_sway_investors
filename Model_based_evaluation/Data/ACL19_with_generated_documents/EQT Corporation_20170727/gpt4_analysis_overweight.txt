### Investment Outlook Report for EQT Corporation: Overweight Stance

#### Executive Summary
EQT Corporation has demonstrated strong financial and operational performance in the second quarter of 2017, with significant improvements in earnings, operating cash flow, and production volumes. The company's strategic acquisition of Rice Energy not only expands its asset base but also optimizes its operational efficiency, especially in the midstream and upstream segments. Given these strengths alongside robust liquidity and substantial increase in production and sales volumes, an overweight investment stance is recommended.

#### Financial Performance
- **Earnings**: EQT reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.06 in Q2 2017, a stark improvement from a $0.38 loss in Q2 2016.
- **Operating Cash Flow**: There was a substantial increase in adjusted operating cash flow, rising to $223 million from $105 million in Q2 2016.
- **Production Sales Volume**: Recorded at 198 Bcfe, which is a 7% increase YOY and slightly above the upper end of the guidance range.
- **Revenue and Expenses**: Operating revenue for the production company was $631 million, up significantly from the previous year. Total operating expenses were closely aligned with volume growth, indicating efficient management.

#### Operational Insights
- **Realized Prices**: The realized price including derivatives was $2.86 per Mcfe, marking a 36% increase YOY.
- **Midstream Results**: EQT Gathering’s operating income rose to $83.3 million, supported by increased production in the Marcellus Shale.
- **Transmission and Capacity**: Transition expenses tied to capacity use on the Rockies Express Pipeline and Ohio Valley Connector have influenced costs, but strategic use has netted cost-efficient results.

#### Strategic Initiatives
- **Acquisition of Rice Energy**: This acquisition is expected to create substantial synergies, particularly in reducing capital requirements for midstream solutions and enhancing the efficiency of drilled volumes collection. This acquisition solidifies EQT's position in both the Utica Shale in Pennsylvania and the Marcellus Shale.
- **Infrastructure Projects**: The underway Mountain Valley Pipeline project is set to enhance access to premium Southeast and Mid-Atlantic markets, potently improving realized prices further.

#### Liquidity and Capital Expenditure
- **Liquidity**: EQT ended the quarter with a robust liquidity position, with zero net short-term debt and approximately $561 million in cash.
- **Capital Expenditure**: The company is well-positioned to fund its estimated $1.5 billion CapEx for 2017 through operating cash flow and existing cash reserves, excluding additional outlays due to the Rice transaction.

#### Risk Factors and Considerations
- **Market Volatility**: Natural gas and NGL prices remain susceptible to market volatility and regulatory changes.
- **Integration Risks**: The integration of Rice’s operations could present unforeseen challenges despite the anticipated synergies.

#### Conclusion
EQT Corporation's marked improvement in financial metrics, strategic acquisitions, and development projects position it strongly for future growth. The successful expansion and optimization of both midstream and upstream segments, bolstered by stable financial health, present a compelling case for an overweight investment stance. Investors are recommended to consider EQT for inclusion in portfolios seeking growth with managed risk exposure.
