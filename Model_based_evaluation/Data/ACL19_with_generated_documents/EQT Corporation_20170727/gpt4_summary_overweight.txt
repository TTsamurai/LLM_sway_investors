### Executive Summary

#### Earnings Overview and Financial Performance:

1. **Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS)**:
   - EQT Corporation reported significant year-over-year improvement in operational efficiency, with adjusted earnings per diluted share for Q2 2017 reaching $0.06, compared to a $0.38 loss in Q2 2016. This turnaround is indicative of strategic adjustments and could warrant an overweight stance for investors seeking growth.

2. **Operating Cash Flow**:
   - Adjusted operating cash flow has seen a robust increase from $105 million in Q2 2016 to $223 million in Q2 2017, nearly doubling the operational liquidity. This boost, driven by operational improvements and perhaps increased production volumes, strengthens the financial footing of EQT Corporation.

3. **Revenue and Production**:
   - Revenue surged to $631 million in Q2 2017 from $77 million in Q2 2016, driven by a considerable hike in production sales volume which saw a 7% increase year-over-year, topping guidance predictions. The realized price per Mcfe also increased by 36% YoY, contributing significantly to the revenue.

4. **Operational Costs**:
   - Total operating expenses correlated with volume growth, showing a 10% increase linked mainly to the transportation of higher volumes through the Rockies Express Pipeline and Ohio Valley Connector.

5. **Midstream and Transmission Income**:
   - Midstream operating income rose to $83.3 million, a 12% increase YoY, suggesting efficient leverage of the production upturn. 
   - Transmission income modestly increased by $1.9 million YoY to $57.8 million, bolstered by heightened firm reservation fee revenue, which underscores an expanding infrastructure capability likely to support future growth.

#### Strategic Developments:

1. **Rice Energy Acquisition**:
   - The proposed acquisition of Rice Energy represents a strategic pivot, expected to add substantial value through synergies in both upstream and midstream capacities. This move should also enable EQT to optimize and reduce capital outlay on infrastructure, given overlapping operational geographics between the two entities.

2. **Pipeline Projects and Market Access**:
   - The anticipated completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline project is set to enhance market access to the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, promising to improve the realized price margins through expanded distribution channels.

#### Financial Position and Forecast:

1. **Liquidity and Debt Management**:
   - EQT reported a robust liquidity profile, with approximately $561 million in cash and no net short-term debt. This strong liquidity position supports a strategic cushion for forthcoming capital expenditures and acquisition-related costs.

2. **CapEx and Cash Flow Forecast**:
   - For 2017, the projected operating cash flow of $1.2 billion is set to fully cover the anticipated CapEx of $1.5 billion, affirming financial prudence and operational foresight. This forecast excludes potential increments owing to the Rice acquisition, which should further enhance operational capabilities.

#### Investment Stance:

Given the comprehensive review of EQTâ€™s Q2 financial metrics and strategic initiatives, especially the acquisition of Rice Energy and infrastructure developments, we recommend an overweight stance on EQT shares. The company has demonstrated a turnaround in profitability, cash flow expansion, strategic asset optimization, and promising growth facilitation through enhanced pipeline capacities. These factors collectively suggest a robust growth trajectory and a favorable risk-reward balance for potential investors. Furthermore, the financial robustness to accommodate significant strategic shifts like the Rice acquisition without undermining the liquidity is a testament to solid management and promising long-term value creation.
