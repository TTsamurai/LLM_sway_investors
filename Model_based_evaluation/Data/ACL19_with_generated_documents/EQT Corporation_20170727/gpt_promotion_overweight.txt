Based on the recent earnings call, EQT Corporation has shown significant improvements in their second quarter results, with an adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.06 compared to a loss in the same quarter of the previous year. The company has also increased their adjusted operating cash flow and production sales volume, leading to higher operating revenue and a significant improvement in the realized price for their products.

Additionally, EQT Midstream Partners and EQT GP Holdings results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results, showing a strong overall performance. The company's liquidity position is also strong, with zero net short-term debt outstanding and a significant amount of cash on the balance sheet, allowing them to fund their 2017 CapEx forecast.

The acquisition of Rice Energy will also lead to increased crews and less capital required for midstream solutions, benefiting both the upstream and midstream business.

Based on these positive results and the potential for continued growth with the Rice Energy acquisition, I recommend an overweight investment stance on EQT Corporation. Their strong financial performance and strategic acquisitions make them a compelling investment opportunity.
