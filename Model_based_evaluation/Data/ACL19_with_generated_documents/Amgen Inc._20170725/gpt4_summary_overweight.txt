Amgen has reported a solid financial performance in the recent fiscal quarter, demonstrating robust growth across several key products in its portfolio which supports our 'overweight' investment stance for the following reasons:

1. **Sales Performance:**
   - Overall sales increased by 2% YoY, indicating steady growth.
   - U.S. sales saw a 2% increase while international sales grew by 8% (excluding foreign exchange impacts), and 3% including it, with significant contributions from Europe.

2. **Product-Specific Growth:**
   - **Prolia:** Sales grew by 15% with an 18% volume increase YoY, capturing increased market shares both domestically and internationally. The product enjoys a 20% market share globally and higher in certain regions like Australia, Switzerland, and Ireland. Prolia's clinical effectiveness in reducing fractures and its twice-annual dosage continues to drive its market penetration.
   - **KYPROLIS:** Exhibited a robust 23% growth YoY, supported by successful market introductions globally. Recent studies (ENDEAVOR and ASPIRE) showed significant survival benefits, reinforcing its market position in multiple myeloma treatment.
   - **Repatha:** Continued to expand its market leadership in the PCSK9 segment with shared growth in the U.S. and Europe, capturing a 58% market segment.
   - **XGEVA:** Grew by 4% YoY primarily driven by volume, with upcoming opportunities following positive study results expected to expand the eligible patient base.
   - **Sensipar:** Demonstrated a 10% growth YoY, attributed to price adjustments and unit growth.
   - **Vectibix and Nplate:** Both continue to show strong volume growth, with Vectibix achieving over 50% share in the U.S. EGFR segment.

3. **Operational Highlights:**
   - **Neulasta:** Despite a small YoY decline due to reduced usage of myelosuppressive agents, Neulasta Onpro achieved a 55% sales share, benefiting from improved penetration in chemotherapy regimens.
   - **Enbrel:** Displayed a 1% decline YoY but increased by 24% QoQ. Recent market volume growths in rheumatology and dermatology contributed to this recovery.

### Market and Future Outlook

Amgen's diversified and innovative product line continues to achieve substantial growth and market penetration across multiple therapeutic areas including oncology, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular diseases.
