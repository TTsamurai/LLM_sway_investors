In the recent earnings conference call transcript, PPG reported net sales of $3.5 billion for the fourth quarter and full year 2016, with adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations at $1.19. This represents an EPS growth rate of 3% for the quarter and 7% for the year. However, both figures were impacted by persistent unfavorable currency translation. Net sales were also impacted by approximately $100 million and pre-tax income impacted by about $25 million due to foreign currency translation.

From an end market perspective, volume growth was achieved in industrial coatings, automotive OEM coatings, and packaging coatings, while architectural coatings experienced mixed results across different regions. Notably, protective and marine coatings saw significant sales volume declines due to weakness in marine shipbuilding activity. The glass segment also experienced a decline in North American fiberglass business.

Looking ahead to 2017, the company expects overall improved momentum in global economic growth, with varying growth rates across regions and end markets. This includes gradual economic expansion in the US and Canada, continued positive growth trends in Europe, and cautious optimism for economic growth in Asia. PPG has initiated a business restructuring program to reduce costs in uncertain markets and has announced a cash deployment range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion for acquisitions and share repurchases for 2017 and 2018 combined.

As a financial analyst, it is clear that PPG's recent performance is impacted by currency translation and uneven growth across different end markets. While the company has made strategic actions to strengthen its business portfolio and generate strong cash flows, the challenging economic conditions and volatility in currency exchange rates continue to pose risks. Therefore, I recommend adopting an 'underweight' investment stance for PPG, taking into account the impact of currency translation on financial metrics and the uncertain economic environment.
