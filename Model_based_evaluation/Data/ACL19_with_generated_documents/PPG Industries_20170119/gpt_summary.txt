Based on the conference call transcripts provided, here is a summary of the key financial metrics for PPG:

1. Net Sales: For the fourth quarter of 2016, net sales were $3.5 billion, with a reported decline of 1.5%, but with an increase in sales in local currencies. Full year 2016 sales from continuing operations were $14.8 billion, consistent with the prior year.

3. Sales Volumes: The industrial coatings segment achieved mid-single-digit percentage volume growth, while automotive OEM coatings and packaging coatings saw positive sales volume growth. Notably, there were significant low double-digit sales volume declines in protective and marine coatings due to weakness in marine shipbuilding activity.

Cash Flow and Capital Allocation: The company generated approximately $1.2 billion in cash from continuing operations and deployed over $2.5 billion on share repurchases and acquisitions in 2015 and 2016 combined. A new 2-year cash deployment range of $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion for acquisitions and share repurchases was announced for 2017 and 2018 combined.

6. Portfolio Actions: PPG completed significant portfolio optimization actions, including acquisitions of companies such as MetoKote and Univer, and divestitures of non-core businesses, using the proceeds for growth-related opportunities and value creation for shareholders.

7. Economic Outlook: The company expects an evolving macroeconomic and regulatory environment in 2017, with an anticipated improvement in overall global economic growth and continuing but uneven growth in emerging regions. Factors such as construction markets, automotive industry builds, and economic growth rates in various regions were discussed.

8. Future Expectations: The company expressed a strong focus on organic growth as a key lever for 2017, and presented a positive outlook on growth opportunities in both existing and new markets, driven by technology and customer performance.
