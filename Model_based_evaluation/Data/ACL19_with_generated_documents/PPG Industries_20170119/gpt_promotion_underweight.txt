Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on PPG. The company's reported net sales were impacted by currency translation, and the EPS growth fell short of goals. Sales volumes in the U.S. and Canada were lower, while growth in other regions was inconsistent. The company has announced a restructuring program to manage costs, and price increases have been initiated in various regions to combat inflationary cost pressures. The company's acquisition pipeline remains active, but they will continue to be disciplined in their approach. Overall, the company expects positive EPS growth in 2017, but the timeline for economic growth remains uncertain. Additionally, the global economic and regulatory environment is evolving, and the company will need to aggressively manage all elements of their business to remain competitive. Given these factors, it is advisable to approach an investment in PPG with caution or skepticism.
