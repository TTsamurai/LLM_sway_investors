3. Building Products business, representing remaining 30% to 35% of Buildings, experienced a sales decline of just under 1% organically year-over-year.
4. Building EBITA declined 1% year-over-year to $628 million, with the segment margin decreasing 30 basis points year-over-year to 11.3%.

5. Total Buildings orders increased 2% year-over-year organically, with backlog of $8.3 billion increasing 6% year-over-year.
6. Power Solutions sales increased 7% year-over-year on a reported basis to $1.7 billion due to the impact of lead pass-through. Organic sales, however, were down 1%.
7. Power Solutions segment EBITA of $303 million increased 7% on a reported basis or 12% excluding foreign currency.

8. The company is projected to deliver about a 90-basis point improvement in margin rate in the third quarter and fourth quarter, supporting the overall margin rate for the year.
9. The company is expecting to see an uplift in the legacy BE product portfolio due to a significant contribution from a large shipment that was postponed to the third quarter.
10. For the total year, the company is projecting organic growth of roughly 2.5% to 3% for the Building segment and roughly mid-single-digits in the third quarter and a seasonal high in the fourth quarter for the Power segment. 

Additionally, the company is focused on productivity and merger synergies as a key financial metric, which aligns with the framework established during the EPG conference. There were also additional charges related to a very large project in the legacy BE portfolio that impacted the margin rate.
