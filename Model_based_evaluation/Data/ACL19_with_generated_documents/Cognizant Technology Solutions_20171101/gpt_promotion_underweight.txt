Based on the recent earnings call for Cognizant, it is important to approach the company with caution and skepticism. While the company has reported strong revenue and earnings growth, there are several factors to consider before making an investment decision.

First, the company's emphasis on digital transformation and its acquisitions in the digital space are positive indicators of forward-thinking. However, it is important to note that the shift to digital services may come with higher costs and increased competition in the market.

Additionally, the company's target of 22% non-GAAP operating margin by 2019 may be ambitious, and it remains to be seen if Cognizant can achieve this goal. The company's focus on digital services could also lead to margin pressures if they are unable to effectively manage the costs associated with this transition.

Furthermore, while the company emphasizes repeatable solutions and client co-innovation, it is important to assess whether these solutions have tangible and sustainable benefits for clients. The company's reliance on existing clients for repeat business could also indicate a lack of diversification and potential dependency on a few key clients.

Overall, while Cognizant's focus on digital transformation and innovative solutions is commendable, investors should approach with caution and consider the potential risks and uncertainties associated with the company's strategic shift and growth targets. Based on these factors, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on Cognizant at this time.
