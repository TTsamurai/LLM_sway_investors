Summary Report:

Cognizant's recent earnings conference call transcript highlights the company's strong performance in the third quarter, with revenue at the high end of the guided range and a 9.1% year-over-year growth. Three of the four business segments, including healthcare, product and resources, and communications and media and technology, saw double-digit growth rates. The company also announced two acquisitions to enhance its digital capabilities, which align with its strategy of enabling clients to transition from physical to digital.

Financial metrics, such as non-GAAP EPS of $0.98 and non-GAAP operating margin of 20%, demonstrate strong execution at the top and bottom lines for three consecutive quarters in 2017. The company has raised the low end of its revenue guidance range and expects full-year revenue to be in the range of $14.78 billion to $14.84 billion, with a full-year non-GAAP operating margin of at least 19.6%.

The company's emphasis on digital at scale and repeatable solutions is resonating with clients, as demonstrated by examples of digital transformation bringing competitive advantages for clients. Cognizant has systematically built out significant capabilities for digital transformation, including client co-innovation centers, platform-based software, and solutions. The company has also been aggressively building high-end digital skills in areas such as data science, design thinking, cybersecurity, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and automation.

In the healthcare sector, Cognizant has made major investments in healthcare technology and operations, and the company is positioned as a leading provider of enhanced government processed platforms, digital solutions, and services for commercial and government managed healthcare programs in the US.

The company's transition to digital services is progressing well, with digital revenue growing at a double-digit pace ahead of the company average. Cognizant has a healthy mix shift toward digital, and its digital revenue as a percentage of total company revenue is about 26%. Furthermore, the company is already a significant player in digital aspects of financial services.

Cognizant's acquisitions, Netcentric and Zone, will become part of the Cognizant digital business practice area, contributing to revenue synergies and allowing the company to offer more integrated and holistic solutions to clients.

In terms of financial performance, the company is on track with its transition to digital and margin improvement targets. The target non-GAAP operating margin of 22% by 2019 is supported by a healthy mix shift and continued execution on the transition plan.

Overall, Cognizant's strong financial performance, emphasis on digital capabilities, and repeatable solutions position the company as a leading firm envisioning and building the digital economy. However, the focus on digital growth and acquisitions may also indicate increased competition and potential risks. As a financial analyst, an 'underweight' investment stance may be appropriate considering these factors.
