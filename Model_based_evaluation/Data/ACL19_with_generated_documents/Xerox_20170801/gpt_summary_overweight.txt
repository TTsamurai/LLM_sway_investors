Based on the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, here is a summary of the key financial metrics and a recommendation for an 'overweight' investment stance:

Key Financial Metrics:
1. Revenue: Q2 revenues were down $226 million or 8.1% in actual currency, 6.4% at constant currency. The decline was driven by equipment revenue, with post sale revenue declining 3.9% in constant currency.

2. Cost Ratios: The company saw good progress in cost ratios, with adjusted operating margin expansion of 40 basis points and gross margin expanding 50 basis points. R&D expenditure as a percentage of revenue was flat. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up 10 basis points as a result of higher revenue declines.

3. Adjusted EPS: Adjusted EPS was $0.87, down $0.11 from the second quarter of 2016, driven by higher tax rate and lower equity income. GAAP EPS was $0.63 in the quarter.

4. Operating Cash Flow: Operating cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter was $343 million, up $84 million year-over-year. Free cash flow was $322 million, up $101 million year-over-year.

Recommendation:
Based on the operational progress, expanding margins, and cash flow improvements, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance. Despite the revenue decline in Q2, the company has shown strong progress in cost management and demonstrated an ability to generate strong operating cash flow. Additionally, the company is on track to deliver its target $600 million of gross savings in 2017, which will contribute to margin expansion and support investments to improve revenue trajectory. The strategic growth areas are down 0.7% in constant currency and comprise 39% of total revenues year-to-date, showing a shift in the revenue mix. Therefore, with a positive outlook for improving equipment revenue trends in the second half, the company is well-positioned for future growth. This recommendation takes into account the potential impact of the strong performance in Q4, which historically represents the strongest quarter of the year for the company's revenues and margins.
