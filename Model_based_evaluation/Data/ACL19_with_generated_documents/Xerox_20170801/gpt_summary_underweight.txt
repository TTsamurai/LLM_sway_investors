Thank you for providing the transcript of the earnings conference call. Based on the information presented, I recommend adopting an underweight investment stance for this company. Several key financial metrics and performance indicators point to a challenging operating environment for the company.

First, revenue declined by 8.1% in actual currency and 6.4% at constant currency. Equipment revenue showed significant declines, particularly in Managed Document Services and the public sector, which experienced longer sales cycles and product transitions. These declines had a significant impact on overall revenue.

Secondly, while cost ratios demonstrated good progress and margin expansion, the negative impact of revenue declines and currency translation resulted in adjusted operating margin expansion of only 40 basis points. This indicates that the company's cost-saving measures may not be sufficient to offset the decline in revenue.

Additionally, the company reported a higher tax rate of 27%, which had a negative impact of approximately $0.09 on adjusted EPS. This indicates a potential drag on profitability.

Furthermore, the company's strategic growth areas were down 0.7% in constant currency, reflecting lower equipment sales and Managed Document Services revenue. The company also experienced lower new business signings, indicating challenges in driving revenue growth.

While the company has implemented a strategic transformation program to drive cost savings and improve revenue performance, it is facing headwinds in product transition timing, currency impact, and tax rate, which could continue to affect its financial performance.

Considering these factors, I recommend an underweight investment stance for the company until there are more concrete signs of revenue recovery and improved profitability. It is important to closely monitor the company's ability to execute its transformation program and drive revenue growth in the coming quarters.
