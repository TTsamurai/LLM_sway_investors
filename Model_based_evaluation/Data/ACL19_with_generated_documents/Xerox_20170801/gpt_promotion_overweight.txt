Based on the recent earnings call transcript, I would recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company demonstrated operational progress in Q2, with expanding margins and cash flow. Despite a 8.1% decline in revenue, the company has anticipated this and expects an improvement in equipment revenue trends in the second half of the year, leading to peak revenue performance in Q4.

The company's strategic transformation program has been successful, with $600 million in gross savings expected for 2017. This program has not only led to expanding margins, but also made the company more efficient and competitive. Furthermore, the company is confident in meeting this target and might even exceed it, showing a commitment to cost transformation.

Overall, the company's operational strides, strong margins, and cash flow make the company a compelling investment option. The expected improvement in revenue trends and the successful strategic transformation program indicate a positive future outlook for the company.
