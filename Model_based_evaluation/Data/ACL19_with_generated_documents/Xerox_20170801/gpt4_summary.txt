A detailed financial summary based on the earnings conference call transcripts for Q2 is provided below.

**Revenue Overview:**
- **Total Revenue:** Decreased by $226 million or 8.1% in actual currency and 6.4% in constant currency, reflecting the weakest quarter as anticipated due to product launch timing and competitive challenges.
- **North America Revenue:** Declined 7.3% or 6.9% in constant currency, representing 60% of total revenues.
- **International Revenue:** Fell by 8.9% or 4.6% in constant currency, with more significant declines in Europe, offset by some growth in developing markets.
- **Equipment Sales:** Dropped by 16% or 14.6% in constant currency, impacted by transitions and delay in new product availability, particularly noticeable in high-value Managed Document Services (MDS) and public sector sales.

**Cost Management and Margins:**
- **Operating Margins:** Adjusted operating margins improved by 40 basis points, benefiting from strategic cost transformations which offset revenue declines and currency headwinds.
- **Gross Margin:** Expanded by 50 basis points.
- **R&D and SG&A:** R&D expenses remained flat as a percentage of revenue, while SG&A increased slightly by 10 basis points due to higher revenue declines.

**Profitability:**
- **Adjusted EPS:** Was $0.87, down $0.11 from Q2 2016, pressured by higher tax rates and lower equity income but benefitted from lower interest expenses and cost reductions.
- **GAAP EPS:** Stood at $0.63, differences arising mainly due to restructuring and related costs, non-service retirement costs, and amortization of intangible assets.

**Strategic Initiatives:**
- **Cost Savings:** Achieved $600 million target in gross savings from strategic transformation, improving efficiencies across facilities, service delivery, supply chain, IT, and SG&A. 
- **Investments:** Continued investments in product development, particularly in lower-end A4 products, expected to yield longer-term profitability despite initial negative margins.

**Cash Flow and Capital Management:**
- **Operating Cash Flow:** Improved significantly to $343 million, up $84 million year-over-year, driven by efficient working capital management and timing of payments.
- **Free Cash Flow:** Reported at $322 million, up $101 million from the previous year.
- **Investing Activities:** Included spending on acquisitions and capital expenditures totaling $77 million.
- **Debt and Capital Structure:** Ended the quarter with $5 billion in debt, maintaining stable levels compared to Q1 and reflecting repayments and better debt management aligned with strategic goals.

**Future Outlook:**
- **Revenue:** Expected to improve in the second half with stronger Q4 due to full availability of new products and anticipated benefits from the strategic initiatives.
- **Adjusted Operating Margin Guidance:** Reaffirmed at 12.5% to 13.5% for the year.
- **Adjusted EPS Guidance:** Narrowed to $3.20 to $3.44, removing the upper end to accommodate the slower than expected product rollout and investments.
