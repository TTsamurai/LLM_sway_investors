The company's leadership seems confident in their ability to continue driving user growth and engagement, particularly through product changes and marketing efforts. They are also focusing on simplifying and differentiating their revenue products, but acknowledge that it may take some time to see significant results. The company has also made significant investments in live streaming and machine learning to enhance the user experience and attract new advertisers.

Despite the positive outlook for user growth, the company recognizes the challenges posed by a competitive digital advertising landscape. They are experiencing increased competition from other large-scale players in the industry, which has impacted their ability to attract advertising demand. However, the company is hopeful that their focus on video content and non-ad driven revenue streams will help them capture a broader range of advertising dollars.

Overall, while the company is confident in their ability to continue growing and innovating, particularly in the live streaming and machine learning spaces, they acknowledge the need to prove ROI for advertisers and address marketplace challenges. As a financial analyst, it is important to monitor the company's progress in simplifying and differentiating their revenue products and their ability to capture new advertising dollars as competition in the space intensifies. Given the competitive landscape and the need to demonstrate the effectiveness of their revenue products, an 'underweight' investment stance may be appropriate at this time.
