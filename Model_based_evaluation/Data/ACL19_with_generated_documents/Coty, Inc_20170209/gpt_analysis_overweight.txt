 of mass fragrance, and it's clear that we need to start repositioning the fragrances and then look at the brands that we have and start executing the strategy that our proposals put in place. Overall, I believe the mass fragrance category globally presents good opportunities for us to reposition and it's a category which has great potential for us. So, overall, the combination of the brands that we have and the approach that we are going to do give us a lot of believe that we will be able to do it and reposition the mass fragrance category where we operate. Thank you, everyone, for your time today. This concludes our second-quarter conference call. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the next quarter. Bye-bye.
