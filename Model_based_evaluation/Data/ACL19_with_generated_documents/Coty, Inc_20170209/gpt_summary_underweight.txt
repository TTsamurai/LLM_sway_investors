, where on one side there are some challenges, but on the other side there are opportunities to focus on specific brands in specific markets. As for strengthening the portfolio through M&A, our focus is on strategic acquisitions and planned portfolio rationalization. With the acquisitions of ghd and Younique, we expect accretive growth and benefits in net revenue and adjusted earnings. ghd expands our assortment of premium products for the Salon channel, while Younique leverages a high-growth e-commerce platform and social selling direct-to-consumer business model. In terms of portfolio rationalization, we are exploring potential alternatives for non-core portfolio brands, including divestitures.

In conclusion, while fiscal 2017 remains a challenging transitional year, our strategic actions and reshaping efforts position us for long-term growth potential as a global leader and challenger in the beauty industry. With a focus on repositioning and revitalizing our brands, as well as investments in digital transformation, we are confident in our ability to address current challenges and return the combined company to growth.

Based on the information provided in the conference call transcript, we are adopting an 'underweight' investment stance due to the challenging quarter experienced by Coty. The Consumer Beauty division, which represents approximately half of the combined portfolio revenues, faced disappointing results and will take time to return to growth. Additionally, the distractions associated with the integration efforts, significantly higher inventory levels, and competitive market pressures pose risks to the company's performance in the short term.

Key financial metrics to consider:

1. Revenue growth: The conference call highlighted the impact of higher-than-anticipated inventory levels, competitive pressure, and challenges in the Consumer Beauty division on the company's revenue growth. It is important to closely monitor revenue performance and the company's ability to address the current challenges and return to growth.

2. Cash flow: The integration efforts and challenges in the Consumer Beauty division may impact the company's cash flow. Monitoring the cash flow performance and the effectiveness of strategic actions in addressing the challenges is crucial.

3. Synergy target: Coty reiterated its previously communicated $750 million synergy target by fiscal 2020 as a result of the P&G Beauty Business merger. Tracking the progress towards achieving this synergy target will be important for assessing the company's operational efficiency and cost management.

4. Divisional performance: The divisional performance of Professional Beauty, Luxury, and Consumer Beauty should be closely monitored to assess the impact of strategic actions and reshaping efforts on each division's growth prospects.

Given the challenges highlighted in the conference call, it is important for investors to closely monitor the company's financial metrics and performance to make informed investment decisions. Adopting an 'underweight' investment stance reflects the need for caution and a thorough evaluation of the company's ability to navigate the current challenges and return to growth in the long term.
