 of mass fragrance. We believe that by repositioning some of these brands and focusing on the right markets, we can revitalize the category and return to growth. In conclusion, based on the discussion and analysis presented in the earnings call transcript, our assessment is that Coty is undergoing a challenging transitional period but is taking the necessary steps to address the current challenges and position itself for long-term growth. The CEO's strategic vision for the company includes reinvigorating established brands, repositioning brands with higher growth potential, stabilizing remaining brands, and reshaping the organization for growth. Key financial metrics such as revenue growth, cash flow, and geographic expansion are expected to improve as the company implements these strategic initiatives. As financial analysts, we are adopting an 'overweight' investment stance on Coty, based on our assessment of the company's potential to emerge as a global industry leader in the beauty sector. We believe that the comprehensive reshaping of the business and strategic investments in digital transformation and M&A are positioning the company for future success.
