 as customers increasingly recognize the strategic value of our memory and storage solutions across a range of high growth markets. Now, let me summarize the key financial metrics from the recent earnings conference call transcript.

In the fourth quarter, Micron reported revenue of $6.14 billion with record gross margin, operating income, and free cash flow. Full-year revenue, profitability, and free cash flow also set company records. The robust growth in the Compute and Networking Business Unit was driven by strong demand in Cloud and Graphics, with Cloud sales supported by increasing DRAM content per server, and Graphics leveraging GDDR5 and GDDR5X performance. The Mobile Business Unit saw significant growth in eMCP sales due to strong execution and favorable pricing environment. In the Storage Business Unit, a revenue increase of 71% was recorded in Q4, with strong demand for SSD products.

Looking ahead, Micron anticipates continued growth of its 1X DRAM portfolio, volume shipments of new LPDRAM and 3D TLC eMCP products, and production shipments of 64-layer 3D TLC UFS products. The company's strategic priorities include driving cost competitiveness, accelerating the transition to high-value solutions, developing collaboration and partnerships with marquee customers, and investing in talent and a winning culture.

The demand and supply fundamentals for DRAM and NAND remain strong, with a healthy industry supply-demand balance projected throughout 2018. The company is focused on accelerating the deployment of new technologies into volume production and optimizing bit output growth in both DRAM and NAND with a disciplined focus on profitable growth.

In summary, with strong financial performance and positive industry dynamics, Micron presents an attractive investment opportunity with its strategic focus on driving cost competitiveness, accelerating technology transitions, and expanding its high-value product offerings. Adopting an 'overweight' investment stance is supported by the company's ability to capitalize on favorable market trends and maintain a leading position in the memory and storage solutions industry.
