Based on the information from the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. The decrease in net sales and comparable store sales, as well as the impact of unusual weather conditions, are concerning factors. The decline in big ticket sales and average ticket size, as well as the impact of deflation and higher freight costs, have negatively affected gross margin and SG&A. The lack of guidance update at this time is also a red flag. Overall, the company's performance in the first quarter was disappointing, and it is prudent to be cautious on investing in the company at this time.
