.Right, so male analysts have expressed concern over the decline in comparable store sales, attributed to weather conditions in the first quarter of 2017. Specifically, the Northern regions were most impacted by weather, resulting in a 2.2% decrease in comparable store sales. Additionally, the Southern regions faced a tough compare from strong performance the previous year.

The sales decline was seen in both winter and spring seasonal products, affecting categories such as heating units, insulated outerwear, and lawn and garden items. Big ticket sales also declined, driven by a slower start to spring seasonal products such as riding lawn mowers and 3-point equipment.

Strategies to mitigate the impact of weather-related sales decline included increased markdowns to ensure clean inventory positions and more promotional efforts to drive sales and create value for customers.

Gross margin decreased by 60 basis points to 33.1%, primarily due to increased markdowns and higher freight costs, driven by a greater mix of freight-intensive categories and growth in the e-commerce business. Additionally, the mix of merchandise had a slightly negative impact on gross margin, with certain categories such as animal and pet food performing below the chain average.

SG&A deleveraged by 70 basis points to 27% of sales, with the decline in comparable store sales being the primary driver. Other factors such as the higher SG&A rate of Petsense stores and a greater investment in store payroll hours also contributed to the deleverage.

The effective income tax rate for the quarter was 35.6%, lower than the previous year due to the favorable impact of the adoption of new accounting rules.

As for the outlook, the company decided not to update its guidance at the time, as they believe it is best to evaluate performance based on halves rather than quarters. They acknowledged the disappointing Q1 performance but indicated confidence in the spring and summer season ahead. They also estimated their full-year effective tax rate to be in the range of 36.2% to 36.4%.

The company ended the quarter with a cash balance of $73 million and $611 million outstanding debt, with $115 million spent on stock repurchases during the quarter. Inventory levels per store decreased by 3.4% due to the impact of Petsense stores. Excluding Petsense, average inventory levels per store increased by 4.2%.

In answering analysts' questions, the company stressed the impact of weather on sales, the growth of e-commerce, and deflation in the market. They mentioned their long-term targets for total sales growth and comp store sales, expressing confidence in their sales growth initiatives. They also discussed the impact of the oil patch on sales and the potential effects of deflation on their financial performance. They also talked about the impact of e-commerce growth on gross margin and the future impact it could have.

Overall, the company faced challenges in Q1 2017, particularly due to weather conditions impacting sales. However, they remain optimistic about the future and are closely monitoring market conditions and internal factors to make informed decisions about their guidance and future financial performance.
