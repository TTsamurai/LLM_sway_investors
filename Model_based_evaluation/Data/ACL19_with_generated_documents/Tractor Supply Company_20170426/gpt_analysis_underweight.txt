Based on the information provided in the conference call transcript, the company's quarter ended April 1, 2017 saw a decline in net sales and comparable store sales. The decrease in sales was primarily attributed to unseasonable weather conditions affecting the demand for winter and spring seasonal products. The Northern regions of the country experienced the most pronounced impact, whereas the Western region saw solid comp sales growth.

Factors impacting the gross margin included increased markdowns on cold weather seasonal products, higher freight costs due to growth in e-commerce business, and a mix of merchandise sales that included lower margin categories. The SG&A deleveraged due to the decline in comparable store sales, and investment in store payroll hours.

The effective income tax rate reduced, primarily due to the favorable impact of the adoption of new accounting rules related to the recognition of incremental tax benefit on stock option exercises.

While the company is not updating its guidance at this time, the management is optimistic about the business ahead in the spring and summer season. The long-term targets remain high single-digit total sales growth. However, the impact of weather conditions and deflation on the company's performance may continue in the second quarter.

From an investment perspective, the company's underperformance in the first quarter, coupled with the uncertainty around future sales in the second quarter due to weather conditions and deflation, warrants a cautious approach. The current weather and deflation trends are expected to moderate in the back half of the year, but the potential impact on sales and margins should be closely monitored.

Additionally, the company's investment in e-commerce and the impact of higher freight rates on gross margin should be considered in the future outlook. The fluctuating demand for seasonal products and the company's reliance on weather conditions for sales further emphasize the need for an underweight investment stance until the impact of these factors becomes clearer.
