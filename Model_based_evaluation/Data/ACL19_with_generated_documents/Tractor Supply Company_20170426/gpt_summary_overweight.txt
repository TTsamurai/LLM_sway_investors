The key financial metrics to note from the recent earnings conference call transcript are as follows:

1. Net sales were $1.56 billion, resulting in net income of $60.3 million and earnings per share of $0.46 per diluted share.

2. Comparable store sales decreased 2.2% versus a reported increase of 4.9% last year. Adjusting for the week shift, last year's comparable store sales increase would have been 2.6%.

3. The comp transaction count decreased by 1.4% compared to a reported 4.2% increase last year or 2.6% in the prior year adjusted for the week shift.

4. Gross margin decreased 60 basis points to 33.1%, compared to a 30 basis point increase in the prior year. This decrease was driven by increased markdowns in certain cold weather seasonal products.

5. SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, deleveraged by 70 basis points to 27% of sales compared to 26.3% of sales in the prior year's quarter, primarily due to the decline in comparable store sales.

6. The effective income tax rate for the quarter was 35.6% compared to 36.8% last year. The reduction in rate is due to the favorable impact of the adoption of the new accounting rules related to the recognition of incremental tax benefit on stock option exercises.

7. At the end of the first quarter, the company had a cash balance of $73 million and $611 million outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $75 million and $250 million outstanding debt last year.

Adopting an 'overweight' investment stance, it is important to consider the factors influencing the company's financial performance, such as weather conditions impacting sales, the impact of e-commerce on freight costs, and the company's long-term sales growth targets. Additionally, it is crucial to monitor the moderation of deflation in the back half of the year and the impact of oil patch stores on comps. Overall, despite the challenges faced in the first quarter, the company's long-term sales growth targets remain a positive indicator for an 'overweight' investment stance.
