.In my analysis, I would recommend an 'underweight' investment stance due to the following key financial metrics:

1. Net sales were $1.56 billion, with a net income of $60.3 million and earnings per share of $0.46, representing a decrease in comparable store sales by 2.2% versus the reported increase of 4.9% last year.
2. Gross margin decreased by 60 basis points to 33.1%, driven by increased markdowns in cold weather seasonal products and higher promotional efforts to drive sales. Additionally, freight negatively impacted gross margin due to a greater mix of freight-intensive categories and higher average fuel costs.
3. SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, deleveraged by 70 basis points to 27% of sales compared to 26.3% last year, primarily due to the decline in comparable store sales. And Petsense, operating at a higher SG&A rate, also had an impact on the overall ratio.
4. The average ticket decreased by approximately 90 basis points, with big-ticket sales declining and deflation playing a role in this decrease.
5. I would focus on the potential impact of the challenging sales quarter, with the decline in comparable store sales, decreased gross margin and slight deleverage in SG&A raising concerns about the company's ability to achieve its long-term targets of high single-digit total sales growth. Additionally, the impact of weather volatility and deflation on sales and margin should be considered in the overall investment stance.
