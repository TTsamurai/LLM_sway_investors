. Thank you for joining us today. I wanted to provide some additional insights and analysis following the recent earnings call for Kimberly-Clark. Based on the information provided, it is clear that the company is facing some challenges, particularly in the North American market. Organic sales were down 1% in the quarter, and there were specific areas of concern, such as the decline in organic sales in consumer businesses in North America, which was attributed to category softness, competitive activity, and lower promotional shipments.

The company also highlighted the slower start to the year and the need to achieve better performance going forward, particularly in North America. Additionally, the company expressed caution regarding the retail environment, citing a decline in store traffic and a shift towards e-commerce. This change in consumer behavior could impact sales and promotional strategies.

Furthermore, while the company remains optimistic about future opportunities and is investing in brand growth initiatives, it is important to note that the company has revised its organic sales growth outlook for the year to 1% to 2%, down from the original estimate of approximately 2%. This indicates a downward trend that investors should consider.

The company also mentioned that the promotional environment has become more competitive, particularly in China, and that the pricing outlook for 2017 is not as positive as previously expected. Additionally, the company is facing challenges in various international markets, including Brazil, Argentina, and South Korea.

In light of these factors, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on Kimberly-Clark. The company's recent earnings call and outlook suggest that there are uncertainties and challenges ahead, particularly in the North American market. It is important for investors to exercise caution and closely monitor the company's performance before making investment decisions.
