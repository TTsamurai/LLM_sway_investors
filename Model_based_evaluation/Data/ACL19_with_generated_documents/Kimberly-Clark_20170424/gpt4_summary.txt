**Subject: Recent Earnings Conference Call Summary - Key Financial Metrics and Outlook**

**1. Organic Sales Performance:**
- Overall organic sales decreased by 1% in the most recent quarter, with mixed results across various regions and product categories.
- In North America, organic sales declined by 3% in the consumer business, attributed to category softness, heightened competition, and reduced promotional shipments. There was a notable 7% volume decline in Consumer Tissue, primarily in bathroom tissues.
- In developing and emerging markets, organic sales experienced a 4% growth, in line with expectations; specific highlights included:
  - China: Low single-digit organic sales growth in diapers due to strong volume growth offset by lower selling prices.
  - Brazil: High single-digit growth in Personal Care from the previous year's 5% decline.
  - Argentina: Low double-digit organic sales growth in Personal Care primarily driven by higher selling prices.

**2. Market Share and Innovations:**
- Market share in North America remained stable year-on-year, with a 1-point increase sequentially in infant and child care.
- Planned product innovations for future growth include U by Kotex Fitness in feminine care, enhancements to Huggies diapers and baby wipes, and new Kleenex facial tissue offerings.

**3. Financial Outlook for 2017:**
- Expected sales increase of 1% to 2%, with currency impact expected to be neutral.

- Earnings per share are projected to increase by 3% to 5% year-on-year, with a target range of $6.20 to $6.35.

- The long-term strategic outlook remains focused on emerging market potentials and strengthening category growth through continued innovation and market execution.

**6. Cost Management and Savings:**
