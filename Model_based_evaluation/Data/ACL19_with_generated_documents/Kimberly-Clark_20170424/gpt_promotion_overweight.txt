 and its long-term value creation opportunities. We believe that the company's recent earnings call reflects some challenges in certain markets, particularly in North America. However, we are excited about the company's planned product innovations which are expected to drive growth in the near term. We are also optimistic about the company's opportunities to create long-term shareholder value. Based on the information provided in the earnings call, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company, as we believe in its potential for long-term growth and competitiveness. Thank you.
