**Overview of Quarterly Performance:**
In the recent quarter, Kimberly-Clark experienced mixed financial results. We observed a slight decrease in organic sales, down by 1% overall. North America underperformed with a 3% drop in organic sales within consumer businesses, primarily due to category softness, increased competition, and lower promotional shipments. This has been somewhat offset by a more positive performance in developing and emerging markets, which saw a 4% organic sales growth.

- **Market Share:** Stable in infant and child care, increasing sequentially by 1 point.
- **Cost Inflation:** Increased estimate by $75 million, primarily driven by external factors affecting commodities.

**Investment Thesis**
Despite a turbulent quarter, Kimberly-Clark is setting a strong foundation for recovering and exceeding performance moving forward into the latter half of the year. The planned product innovations and strategic focus on execution in sales and retail merchandising should help drive organic sales growth. The firm's developing market operations continue to perform well, contributing positively to the overall company growth.

Based on the outlined strategic initiatives, positive outlook, and the expected stabilization in core markets, our stance on Kimberly-Clark is overweight. We anticipate that the firm will leverage its strong brands and market position to navigate through current challenges and capitalize on growth opportunities effectively.

**Conclusion**
We recommend investors to maintain an overweight position in Kimberly-Clark as the anticipated improvements in the latter half of the year and favorable market dynamics in developing regions are expected to enhance shareholder value. Kimberly-Clark's commitment to innovation and strategic execution further augments our positive outlook on the companyâ€™s future performance.
