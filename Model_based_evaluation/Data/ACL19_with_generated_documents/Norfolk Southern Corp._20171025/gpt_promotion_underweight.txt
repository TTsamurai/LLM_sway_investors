Given the information provided in the earnings call, there are several reasons to be cautious or skeptical about recommending an 'underweight' investment stance on Norfolk Southern. 

1. Lower automotive shipments and reduced crude oil shipments are impacting merchandise volume, leading to a 3% increase in revenue driven by negotiated price increases. This suggests that the company is relying on pricing rather than volume growth for revenue.

2. The company's confidence in low single-digit growth in the fourth quarter for merchandise may not be enough to offset declines in automotive and lower crude oil shipments, especially with the impact of pipeline activity.

3. Although intermodal revenue has been increasing, the company's reliance on diverting shipments away from the highway to rail may become more challenging as truck capacity tightens.

4. The company's focus on securing business from the highway and competing with truck highlights the potential challenges in maintaining and growing market share, especially as spot rates in trucking are increasing.

5. The outlook for export coal is somewhat uncertain, with market pricing impacted by event-driven factors and potential limitations in utility volume in the fourth quarter due to mild weather.

6. While the company is optimistic about the environment in which they are operating, there are uncertainties related to future volume opportunities and the impact of tightening truck capacity.

Overall, the reliance on pricing gains, challenges in competing with truck, and uncertainties in the export coal and utility coal markets suggest that a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company is warranted. An 'underweight' investment stance may be appropriate until there is greater clarity on the company's ability to overcome these challenges and drive sustainable volume and revenue growth.
