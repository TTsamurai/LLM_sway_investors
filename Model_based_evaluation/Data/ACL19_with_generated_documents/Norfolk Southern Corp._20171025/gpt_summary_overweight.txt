Summary Report on Norfolk Southern Corporation's Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call Transcript
Norfolk Southern Corporation reported a 6% increase in total revenue for the third quarter of 2017, driven by volume gains in intermodal, coal, and steel, as well as increased pricing. The company achieved record volume in intermodal for the second consecutive quarter, with total units exceeding 1 million. Additionally, coal posted year-over-year revenue and volume growth due to increased export coal volume and pricing, although utility volume decreased due to mild weather.

Looking ahead, the company expects low single-digit growth in the fourth quarter in the merchandise segment, with industrial production driving demand in steel and growth in construction impacting aggregate volume. Intermodal expectations remain strong due to tight trucking capacity, which will be further impacted by the ELD implementation in December. In the coal segment, fourth quarter utility volume is projected to be in the range of 15 million to 17 million tons, impacted by the mild summer weather, while export tonnage is expected to exceed last year's levels.

The company's market approach focuses on tailoring the right service to customers, collaborating with them to develop beneficial products, and enhancing their competitiveness in an evolving marketplace. Norfolk Southern's primary form of competition is truck, and the company aims to offer a dependable service product and a consistent approach. With a focused approach on competing with truck and increasing collaboration with channel partners, the company sees growth opportunities in a tightening truck environment and expects to grow both volume and rate next year.

In terms of pricing, the company renegotiated contracts in the third quarter with a higher level of increase than in the second quarter, particularly in the truck competitive business. Looking towards 2018, the company expects to leverage its existing capacity and invest in big areas to drive shareholder return. Norfolk Southern is implementing a capital plan for 2018 that focuses on a predictable service product, collaboration with short line partners, and innovative service products that generate a return on existing assets.

Based on the presented financial metrics and growth opportunities, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for Norfolk Southern Corporation. The company's strong performance in the third quarter, strategic market approach, and focus on competing with truck position it well for potential growth and increased shareholder value.
