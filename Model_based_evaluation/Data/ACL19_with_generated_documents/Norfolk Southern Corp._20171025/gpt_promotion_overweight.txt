Based on the recent earnings call from Norfolk Southern, there are several key points worth noting in recommending an 'overweight' investment stance for the company. 

Firstly, the company reported a 6% increase in total revenue for the third quarter of 2017 compared to 2016. This growth was driven by volume gains in intermodal, coal, and steel, as well as increased pricing. The company's strategic plan has proven to be strong and sustainable.

Merchandise volume was slightly down in the third quarter, but overall merchandise revenue was up by 3% due to negotiated price increases that outpaced volume losses. Intermodal revenue also saw a significant increase of 8% and achieved a record volume for the second consecutive quarter.

In the coal sector, the company reported year-over-year revenue and volume growth, particularly in export coal. However, utility volume decreased due to mild weather causing a decline in overall coal burn in eastern utilities. Despite this, the company remains focused on pricing in all markets.

Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the company expects low single-digit growth in merchandise, with industrial production driving demand in steel and growth in construction positively impacting aggregate volume. Intermodal expectations also remain strong as tight trucking capacity will be further impacted by the upcoming ELD implementation in December.

In the coal sector, the company expects both utility and export volume to continue exceeding last year's figures, with export coal market expected to remain tight through the first half of next year.

Overall, Norfolk Southern's market approach and current opportunities are consistent with their strategic plan, which offers a balance of safety, service, productivity, and growth to drive shareholder value. The company delivers a customer-centric service product that adapts to the needs of customers and is confident that this approach will continue to provide revenue, volume growth, and shareholder value.

In addition, the company's focus on competing with trucks, the tightening truck market, and the improving economy all point towards positive opportunities for growth and increased revenue. The company's differentiated service product and long-term approach to supporting customers' growth have been reflected in volumes and revenue, particularly within the intermodal sector.

Given the company's strong performance and strategic approach to market opportunities, it would be recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance in Norfolk Southern as their market approach, service product, and opportunities for growth and revenue all align with the company's long-term goals and potential for shareholder value.
