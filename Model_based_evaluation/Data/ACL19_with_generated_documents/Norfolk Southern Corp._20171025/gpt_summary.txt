Detailed Summary Report:

The third quarter 2017 revenue growth in all three business units reflects the strength and sustainability of Norfolk Southern's strategic plan. Total revenue for the quarter was up 6% versus 2016, driven by volume gains in intermodal, coal, and steel, and increased pricing. Despite slight decreases in merchandise volume in the third quarter, overall merchandise revenue was up 3% due to negotiated price increases outpacing volume losses. Intermodal revenue increased by 8% versus the same period in 2016, resulting from highway conversions, organic growth with existing customers, and new service offerings. Coal posted year-over-year revenue and volume growth due to increased export coal volume and pricing.

Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, Norfolk Southern expects low single-digit growth in the fourth quarter, with industrial production likely to drive demand in steel, and growth in construction positively impacting aggregate volume. The company also expects increased drilling activity in the Marcellus/Utica region to continue to drive growth in frac sand. However, declines in automotive and lower crude oil shipments, adversely impacted by pipeline activity, will offset these increases. The company remains focused on pricing in all markets.

The primary form of competition for Norfolk Southern is truck, and as truck capacity tightens, the company sees volume and pricing implications. The company's market approach emphasizes tailoring services to meet the needs of customers and collaborating with them to develop the best products that benefit both shareholders and customers. Norfolk Southern aims to enhance the competitiveness of its customers in an evolving marketplace, allowing them to quickly adapt and compete for growth, increasing revenue and strengthening the company's role in their supply chain. The company employs an industrial development team to help customers locate or expand on their lines, providing a future pipeline for growth.

As truck capacity tightens significantly and consumer confidence and manufacturing PMI are at 13-year highs, Norfolk Southern sees a positive environment for its intermodal and merchandise markets. The company is focused on competing with truck and has collaboration within its team to identify volume opportunities that are accretive to the bottom line and do not disrupt existing customer relationships.

In conclusion, Norfolk Southern is well-positioned for growth with a strategic plan focused on customer-centric service products, collaborations with channel partners, and a strong focus on competing with truck. The company remains confident in its ability to drive revenue, volume growth, and shareholder value in the remaining quarters of 2017 and into 2018. Key financial metrics to monitor include revenue growth in the intermodal, coal, and steel segments, as well as the impact of tightening truck capacity on volume and pricing opportunities. Overall, the company's focus on a predictable service product, equipment strategy for growth, and collaboration with short line partners and economic development partners, positions Norfolk Southern for continued success in the marketplace.
