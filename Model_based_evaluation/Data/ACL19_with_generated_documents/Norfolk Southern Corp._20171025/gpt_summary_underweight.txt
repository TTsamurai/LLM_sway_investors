. Our primary focus is on securing business from the highway and we see that spot rates are up 15% in trucking and drive-in over the last couple of months and are up about 25% year-over-year. That's also buttressed by an improving economy in which consumer confidence and the PMI for manufacturing are at effectively 13-year highs. So our focus is on competing with truck. Our market approach and current opportunities are consistent with our strategic plan which offers a balance of safety, service, productivity, and growth to drive shareholder value. The continuity of our management team, operating philosophy, and longstanding customer relationships combined with improving the customer experience and product is the overarching theme of our growth initiatives.

However, based on the transcript, there are some key financial metrics that suggest the company may not be on a trajectory for strong future performance. While third quarter 2017 revenue increased by 6% compared to 2016, the decrease in merchandise volume and utility volume in the third quarter are concerning. This decline was due to lower automotive shipments associated with US vehicle production and reduced crude oil shipments. 

In addition, the transcript mentions that the positive growth in export coal volume and pricing that contributed to revenue and volume growth in coal is not expected to continue at the same level next year. This indicates a potential slowdown in the coal market's contribution to overall revenue growth.

The tightening truck capacity is mentioned as a positive for the company, but it also highlights the company's heavy reliance on being able to compete with the trucking industry. 

Overall, the company's over-reliance on the trucking industry and the potential decline in key revenue drivers such as coal indicate that the company may not be on track for sustainable future growth. Based on these factors, an 'underweight' investment stance for Norfolk Southern may be warranted.
