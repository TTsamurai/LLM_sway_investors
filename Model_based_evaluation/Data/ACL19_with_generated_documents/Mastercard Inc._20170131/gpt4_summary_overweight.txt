**Investment Summary: Overweight**

**Company: Mastercard**

### Financial Performance Overview
Mastercard has demonstrated commendable performance over the year 2016 with robust financial metrics that support an overweight investment stance:

- **Net Revenue Growth**: Achieved a 13% increase, bolstered by strategic execution and expansion in both core and supplementary services.
- **Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth**: Reported an 11% increase, escalating to 19% when normalized for taxes. This indicates efficient fiscal management and profitability.

### Strategic Highlights and Progress
- **Strategic Deals and Partnerships**: Mastercard has successfully renewed or secured numerous deals across global markets, including significant agreements with SunTrust Bank, First National Bank of Omaha, USAA, and international banks such as ABN AMRO and Caixa in Brazil. These partnerships are pivotal for sustaining long-term revenue growth.
- **Legal and Regulatory Wins**: Positive outcomes from UK litigation concerning interchange fees and ongoing regulatory engagements (e.g., VocaLink acquisition) enhance Mastercard’s operational stability and future growth trajectory in critical markets.
- **Digital Innovations and Expansions**: Mastercard continues to push forward its digital initiatives, evidenced by the expansion of its Masterpass digital payment service, and the launch of novel payment solutions such as Mastercard Send. Such innovations are set to capture more of the digital payments market share.

### Global Market Overview
- **United States**: Post-election optimism and steady economic indicators like consumer confidence and unemployment rates bode well for continued consumer spending and transaction growth.
- **Europe**: Persistence in economic recovery, especially in Germany, and stable conditions in the UK post-Brexit provide a promising landscape for Mastercard’s operations.
- **Asia**: While cautious about the slowdown in China, India’s move towards digital payments post-demonetization could represent significant long-term growth opportunities for digital transaction systems.
- **Latin America**: Signs of economic recovery in Brazil present potential for market re-entry and growth despite political uncertainties.

### Forward-Looking Strategy
- **Investment in Digital and Services**: Mastercard is significantly investing in digital solutions, artificial intelligence, and enhanced security services to position itself at the forefront of the payments technology sector. This strategic focus is likely to drive higher transaction volumes and diversify revenue streams.
- **Expansion into New Payment Flows**: The acquisition of VocaLink and exploration of new markets like China signal Mastercard’s aim to capture new payment channels and offer comprehensive payment solutions globally.

### Risks and Concerns
- **Regulatory Changes**: Continuously evolving global regulatory landscapes, particularly concerning digital payments and financial services, pose potential challenges that could impact operations.
- **Geopolitical Uncertainties**: Ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic instabilities in key markets like the UK (Brexit) and Brazil could affect market dynamics and operational efficiency.

### Conclusion and Investment Recommendation
Given Mastercard’s strong financial performance, strategic positioning, and proactive approach to capturing digital and emerging market opportunities, an overweight stance is recommended. Investors should closely monitor regulatory developments and geopolitical risks that could influence future performance but should feel confident in the company’s direction and capability to manage these risks effectively.
