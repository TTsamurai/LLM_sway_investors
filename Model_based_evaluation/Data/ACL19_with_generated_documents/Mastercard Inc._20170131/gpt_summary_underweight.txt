Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. Key financial metrics to consider include the net revenue growth of 10% for the quarter and 13% for the full year of 2016, as well as the EPS growth of 7% for the quarter and 11% for the full year. While these numbers are positive, the cautionary statements about the global economy, particularly in Asia, and the uncertainties surrounding new policy proposals, should be cause for concern. 

The prolonged slowdown in China, the impact of Brexit on the UK and EU, and the uncertainty in Brazil's economy also add to the cautious outlook. Additionally, the potential impact of the recent initiatives around taxation, regulation, infrastructure spending, and trade in the US on the company's financial performance is still unknown.

Furthermore, the company's focus on executing its strategy and growing its business, while positive, should be carefully monitored for its impact in the evolving economic and regulatory landscape. The planned acquisition of VocaLink is also a point of interest, with the expectation to close the transaction in the spring of 2017.

Overall, while the company has demonstrated strong performance in 2016 and continues to focus on innovation and expansion, the uncertain global economic environment and potential policy changes warrant a cautious approach to investment. Therefore, an 'underweight' stance is recommended until there is more clarity on the potential impact of these factors on the company's financial performance.
