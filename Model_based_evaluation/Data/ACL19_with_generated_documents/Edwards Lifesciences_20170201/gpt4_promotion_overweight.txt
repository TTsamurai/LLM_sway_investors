**Investment Recommendation Report**

**Company: Edwards Lifesciences**
**Recommendation: Overweight**

**Executive Summary:**
Edwards Lifesciences has delivered a robust financial performance by closing the fiscal year with significant revenue growth and progressive advancements in its product pipeline. The latest Q4 results show strong adoption of transcatheter heart valves globally, particularly the SAPIEN 3 valve, driven by the groundbreaking outcomes of the PARTNER II trial. Sales insights reflect a 15% increase in global sales nearing $3 billion, emphasizing a 19% underlying annual growth rate. Despite short-term regulatory challenges in France affecting sales, the company's recovery and resumption stance exhibits strategic crisis management and future profit opportunity reclamation. Given these factors, along with upcoming product launches and promising trial results in emerging therapies, an overweight investment stance is strongly recommended.

**Investment Highlights:**

1. **Strong Yearly Growth Trends:**
   Edwards ended its fiscal year with nearly $3 billion in global sales, underlining a 19% annual growth rate. This robust expansion is anchored by increasing global adoption and stable average selling prices.

2. **Transcatheter Heart Valves Momentum:**
   Transcatheter heart valve technology, primarily the SAPIEN 3 valve, continues growing, with Q4 sales up by 41% on an underlying basis versus the prior year. This growth trajectory is supported by expanding procedural adoption across over 500 hospitals and is poised to continue due to positive clinical trial results and innovative product launches.

3. **Pipeline Advancements and Trials:**
   Edwards is set to introduce the Ultra system in Europe and is on track with its CENTERA system receiving CE Mark approval anticipated in the latter half of 2017. Moreover, the FDA approval for the EARLY-TAVR trial positions Edwards at the forefront of extending TAVR therapy to asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis patients, representing a potential growth area beyond current patient populations.

4. **Market Expansion and Future Prospects:**
   The global TAVR opportunity is expected to exceed $5 billion by 2021. The company's focused efforts on market penetration, particularly in under-served regions, align with future growth prospects. Additionally, Edwardsâ€™ acquisition of Valtech Cardio brings enhanced capabilities and broadens its structural heart product offerings.

5. **Consistent Investment in Innovation:**
   Edwards' commitment to innovation and expanding its therapeutic footprint is evident in its sustained R&D investments, aimed at delivering state-of-the-art solutions like the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve and advanced monitoring platforms like HemoSphere.

**Financial Guidance and Projections:**
For 2017, despite the temporary setback in France, Edwards maintains its THV sales guidance projecting a 15-20% underlying growth rate. This projection supports the overweight investment stance as it signifies sustainable growth driven by robust fundamentals and pioneering therapies in the pipeline.

**Conclusion:**
Edwards Lifesciences is well-positioned for continued success in 2017 and beyond. The company's strategic directions, coupled with strong Q4 performance and proactive pipeline development, not only reassure stability but also promise substantial long-term returns. Investors are advised to consider Edwards Lifesciences with an overweight stance, anticipating accelerated growth as the company capitalizes on expanding market opportunities and solidifies its leadership in heart valve innovations.

**Investor Actions:**
Given the upward trajectory and future growth embedded in upcoming product launches and expansion into new markets, increasing stake in Edwards Lifesciences currently presents a strategic advantage for long-term value gains. Investors should monitor upcoming trial results and product approvals closely as potential catalysts for further stock appreciation.
