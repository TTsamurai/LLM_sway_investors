Thank you for sharing the conference call transcript. Based on the information provided, it is clear that Edwards has shown strong financial performance and product leadership across their portfolio. The robust demand for TAVR therapy and growth in Transcatheter Heart Valves and Critical Care product groups are noteworthy. Additionally, the company's focus on expanding its product pipeline with new medical technologies and strategic acquisitions indicates a commitment to driving future growth.

However, there are several factors to consider when adopting an 'underweight' investment stance. Firstly, the impact of the French policy on TAVR sales in the third and fourth quarter should not be overlooked. The interruption caused by lower sales in France may have a lingering effect on Edwards' revenue in the upcoming quarters.

Secondly, while the company has ambitious growth targets for 2017, the anticipated slower Transcatheter Heart Valve (THV) growth rate in comparison to 2016 raises concerns. The potential effects of competition from new entrants in the market and the need for a concerted effort to drive education and therapy adoption in Europe and the U.S. should be carefully evaluated.

Furthermore, the temporary pause in clinical trial enrollment for the PASCAL transcatheter mitral repair system and the uncertainty surrounding its eventual resumption may create a cloud of uncertainty around the company's future offerings in the structural heart program.

In conclusion, while Edwards has made significant progress and continues to demonstrate strong performance, caution should be exercised in considering the company's growth prospects in the short to medium term. The potential impact of market dynamics, regulatory challenges, and internal adjustments on future financial performance should be thoroughly analyzed before making investment decisions.
