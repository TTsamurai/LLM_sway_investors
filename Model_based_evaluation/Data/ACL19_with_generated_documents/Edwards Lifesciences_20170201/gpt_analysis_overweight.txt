Based on the key insights and financial metrics derived from the recent earnings conference call transcript for Edwards:

1. Strong financial performance and product leadership: Edwards reported strong fourth quarter results, with total sales of $768 million, representing a 15% increase on an underlying basis. The global sales for the year were nearly $3 billion, with an underlying annual growth rate of 19%.

2. Market penetration and global growth potential: The company has seen robust demand for its Transcatheter Heart Valves therapy, with global sales of $432 million, up 32% on an underlying basis over the prior year. The market for TAVR therapy is expected to exceed $5 billion by 2021, with growth opportunities in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and the moderate AS patient populations.

3. Future product pipeline and growth strategies: The company plans to launch new medical technologies in the second half of 2017, including the Ultra system and the CENTERA system. These new products are expected to drive future growth and market expansion.

4. Surgical Heart Valve Therapy and Critical Care product group: While sales for Surgical Heart Valve Therapy were down in 2016, Edwards plans to launch new surgical therapies in 2017, including the EDWARDS INTUITY Elite valve system and the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve. The Critical Care product group experienced 3% underlying sales growth and is expected to continue growing between 5% and 7% in 2017.

5. Transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies: The company completed the acquisition of Valtech Cardio and has received a CE Mark for the Cardioband System for transcatheter repair of mitral and tricuspid valves. The company is also working on trials and clinical studies for its transcatheter mitral replacement programs.

Based on these insights and financial metrics, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Edwards. The company has demonstrated strong financial performance and is poised for continued growth with new product launches, market penetration opportunities, and a focus on transformative therapies. The company's expansion into transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies also presents promising growth potential. Overall, Edwards' strategic outlook and growth opportunities make it a favorable investment option.
