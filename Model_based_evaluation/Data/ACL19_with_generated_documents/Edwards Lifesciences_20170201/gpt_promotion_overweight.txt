The recent earnings call from Edwards shows impressive and strong performance across various aspects of their business. Strong fourth quarter results and robust demand for TAVR therapy have contributed to a successful year for the company. With total sales of $768 million in the fourth quarter and global sales of nearly $3 billion, representing an underlying annual growth rate of 19%, the company has shown remarkable growth. The transcatheter heart valves sales grew by 32% on an underlying basis over the prior year, with strong adoption across all geographies, especially in the U.S. and Japan.

The company's near-term product pipeline includes the launch of a new Ultra system and the CENTERA system, which are expected to contribute to future growth. In addition, the company is continuing to enroll patients in the PARTNER III low-risk trial and has received FDA approval for EARLY-TAVR, a trial that will study patients diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis who have not yet developed symptoms. This trial is expected to have a significant impact on the future growth of the company.

In addition to the strong performance in transcatheter heart valves, Edwards also saw growth in its Critical Care product group and expects its underlying sales growth to be between 5% and 7%. The company's new transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies, including the acquisition of Valtech Cardio and the development of the Cardioband System, are expected to contribute to future growth as well.

In conclusion, Edwards has demonstrated impressive financial performance and significant progress on transformational new therapies across its business. The company is enthusiastic about the expansion of catheter-based therapies for structural heart patients and is well-positioned for continued growth and progress in 2017. Based on the company's recent earnings call and its strong performance, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance in Edwards as I believe the company has the potential for continued growth and success in the future.
