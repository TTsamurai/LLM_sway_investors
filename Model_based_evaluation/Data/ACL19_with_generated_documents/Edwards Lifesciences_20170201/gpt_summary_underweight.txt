Thank you for the thorough update. It seems like Edwards is making significant strides in the transcatheter heart valve therapy space and has ambitious plans for the future. However, as a financial analyst, I must adopt a cautious stance and provide a summary report with an 'underweight' investment recommendation. 

Key Financial Metrics:
- Total sales for the quarter were $768 million, an increase of 15% on an underlying basis.
- Global sales for the year were nearly $3 billion, representing an underlying annual growth rate of 19%.
- Transcatheter Heart Valves (THV) sales were $432 million, up 32% on an underlying basis over the prior year.
- Transcatheter Heart Valves sales for the quarter were $267 million, representing a 41% growth on an underlying basis.
- Sales for Surgical Heart Valve Therapy were $189 million for the fourth quarter, a 4% decrease compared to the previous year.
- Critical Care product group sales for the quarter were $146 million, with a 3% underlying growth.
- The company is making significant investments in new medical technologies and anticipates a TAVR opportunity exceeding $5 billion by 2021.

While the company has shown strong performance and growth in certain areas, there are concerns regarding the impact of lower sales in France, the slower growth rate expected for THV in 2017, and the challenges faced in the Surgical Heart Valve Therapy segment. Additionally, the company's new transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies are still in early stages, with uncertainties surrounding timelines and FDA approvals.

Given the above factors and uncertainties, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended. Investors should proceed with caution and closely monitor future developments and performance.
