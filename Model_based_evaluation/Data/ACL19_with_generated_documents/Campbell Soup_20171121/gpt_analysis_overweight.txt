Based on the information from the company's recent earnings conference call transcript, I recommend adopting an 'overweight' investment stance for Campbell. Despite the challenging first quarter results, the company's strong focus on innovation, especially in the health and wellbeing and snacking categories, as well as the growth of its e-commerce capabilities, indicates promising prospects for long-term growth.

Key insights and financial metrics derived from the transcript include:
1. Organic sales declined by 2% in the first quarter, primarily driven by declines in the U.S. soup business.
2. Adjusted EBIT declined by 14% due to several factors, including a key customer's promotional approach, unfavorable weather impacting carrot crop yields, and higher supply chain costs related to hurricane recovery efforts.
3. The company updated its fiscal 2018 guidance, maintaining the sales outlook but lowering the earnings outlook, reflecting the challenging operating environment and impact on gross margins.
4. The company continues to invest in new product innovations, real food efforts, e-commerce capabilities, and venture capital activities, indicating a commitment to long-term growth.
5. Despite challenges in U.S. soup, V8, and carrots, the Global Biscuits and Snacks division remains a bright spot, with growth in sales and strong performance of key products such as Goldfish and cookies.
6. The company is actively pursuing opportunities for growth in the e-commerce space and investing in top talent to lead in this area.

Based on these insights, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for Campbell, as the company's strategic focus on innovation, diversification, and expansion in key growth areas suggests potential for long-term success, despite the near-term challenges.
