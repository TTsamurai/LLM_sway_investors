Based on the earnings call, the company has reported a weaker than expected first quarter performance primarily driven by declines in the U.S. soup business and unfavorable weather that negatively impacted carrot crop yields. Despite these challenges, the company expects to maintain its sales outlook but has lowered its earnings outlook for fiscal 2018. The company remains committed to reinvesting a portion of its ongoing cost savings into driving innovation, particularly in health and wellbeing, and snacking, accelerating e-commerce capabilities, and diversifying its portfolio.

Key financial metrics to consider:

1. Organic Sales Decline: The company reported a 2% decline in organic sales driven primarily by declines in the U.S. soup business.

2. Adjusted EBIT: The company reported a 14% decline in adjusted EBIT, reflecting the impact of the decline in sales and unfavorable weather conditions.

3. Gross Margin Performance: The company experienced performance issues in gross margin due to factors such as lower seasonal inventory build, supply constraints, and higher supply chain costs related to hurricane recovery efforts.

4. Updated Guidance: The company has updated its guidance for fiscal 2018, expecting adjusted EBIT to change by minus 4% to minus 2% and adjusted EPS to change by minus 3 to minus 1%.

5. Investment in Innovation: The company continues to invest in new product innovations such as Well Yes! soup, Chunky Maxx soups, Pepperidge Farm farmhouse cookies, and Bolthouse Farms plant protein milk.

6. E-commerce Growth: The company saw an increase in e-commerce sales in the quarter and is actively working to enhance its distribution capabilities and partnerships in the e-commerce space.

7. External Development: The company is focused on pursuing external development opportunities, including the pending acquisition of Pacific Foods of Oregon.

Based on the company's commitment to invest in innovation, e-commerce capabilities, and external development, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance, as these strategic initiatives have the potential to drive long-term growth and profitability for the company.
