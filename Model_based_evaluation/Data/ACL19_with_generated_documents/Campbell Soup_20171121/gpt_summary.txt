. Thank you. Based on the recent earnings conference call transcripts, the key financial metrics for Campbell are as follows:

Organic sales declined 2% in the first quarter, primarily driven by declines in the U.S. Adjusted EBIT also declined by 14%.
The updated fiscal 2018 guidance maintains the expectation for net sales to be in the range of minus 2 to flat for the year, but has lowered the earnings outlook. Adjusted EBIT is now expected to change by minus 4% to minus 2%, and adjusted EPS is expected to change by minus 3 to minus 1%.
The Campbell Fresh division saw sales comparable to a year ago, with growth in CPG products behind Garden Fresh Gourmet and Bolthouse Farms salad dressing. Beverage capacity and service levels have improved, leading to a return to normal levels of promotional activity.
In the Global Biscuits and Snacks division, sales gains were primarily driven by the strong performance of Pepperidge Farm, especially in snacks like Goldfish crackers and cookies. Outside the U.S., sales in Asia-Pacific were mixed, with gains in Indonesia offsetting declines in Australia.
The company is focused on investing in new product innovations such as Well Yes! soup, Chunky Maxx soups, Pepperidge Farm farmhouse cookies, and Bolthouse Farms plant protein milk. They are also investing in e-commerce capabilities and pursuing smart external development.
Campbell is facing challenges in the U.S. soup business, primarily due to a key customer's promotional approach and unfavorable weather impacting carrot crop yields. The company is taking steps to improve performance, including shifting marketing spending, increasing in-store presence, and ramping up e-commerce plans.
Despite challenges, Campbell remains committed to investing in the business to differentiate its brands, drive innovation, and accelerate e-commerce capabilities. They also expect a weaker first half than second half for the soup category and are focusing on building e-commerce capabilities to lead in that space.
