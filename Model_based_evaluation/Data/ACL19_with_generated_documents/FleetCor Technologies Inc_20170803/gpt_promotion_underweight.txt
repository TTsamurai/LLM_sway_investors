Based on the recent earnings call from the company, it is clear that there are some positive aspects to their Q2 results, such as revenue and profit growth. However, there are also some concerning points that indicate potential challenges for the company. The Comdata MasterCard portfolio conversion in Q1 suffered some one-time losses in Q2 due to a bumpy IT conversion, and the Comdata trucking money movement products were quite soft in the quarter. Additionally, STP was delayed in some pricing actions, and some of the recent IT conversions did not go well. The company did not provide a clear outlook for the future, and it seems that they are still facing challenges in certain areas of their business. Based on these factors, it is recommended to take a cautious or skeptical stance on an investment in this company, and an "underweight" investment stance is suggested. Further monitoring of the company's performance and future developments is also advisable before making any investment decisions.
