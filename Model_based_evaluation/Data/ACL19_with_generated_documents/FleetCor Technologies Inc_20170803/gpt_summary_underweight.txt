Summary:
The company reported very good Q2 results, with revenue of $541 million, up 30%, and cash EPS of $199 million, up 26%. Organic growth was 9% in Q2, with fuel card revenue growth of 8%. The company also reported a 40% increase in Q2 cash flow, and 91.5% global customer revenue retention. However, there were some issues with the Comdata MasterCard portfolio and the trucking money movement products in Q2. The company is also expecting a neutral macro environment for the rest of the year and has adjusted its 2017 guidance to raise full-year cash EPS guidance to $8.34 at the midpoint. Additionally, the company has completed a refinance of its term debt facility and completed the sale of its telematics NexTraq business. The company also provided an update on recent partner relationships, acquisitions, and system conversions. Overall, the company seems to be performing well in Q2, but there are some uncertainties for the rest of the year. Given the potential issues with the Comdata MasterCard portfolio and the trucking money movement products, as well as the unclear outlook for the macro environment, it may be prudent to maintain an 'underweight' investment stance. It would be important to closely monitor the company's performance and the resolution of the issues mentioned before considering a change in investment stance.
