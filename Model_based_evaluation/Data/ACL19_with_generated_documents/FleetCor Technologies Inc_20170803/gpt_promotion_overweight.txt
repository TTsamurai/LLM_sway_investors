Based on the company's recent earnings call, the Q2 results and rest of year outlook are favorable for investment. The company reported very good Q2 results, with revenue of $541 million, up 30%, and cash EPS of $199 million, up 26%. The company also reported a 9% organic growth in Q2 with revenue growth in major product lines. The company is expecting to raise full-year 2017 cash EPS guidance by $0.03 at the midpoint based on the expectations for the rest of the year. This guidance assumes portfolio rebalancing and organic growth overall should be around 8% or 9% for the second half. The company has also gained significant liquidity from refinancing the term debt facility. The Q2 call also provided updates on partner relationships, progress in implementation, acquisitions, and new potential acquisitions. Based on the positive Q2 results and the favorable outlook for the rest of the year, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on the company.
