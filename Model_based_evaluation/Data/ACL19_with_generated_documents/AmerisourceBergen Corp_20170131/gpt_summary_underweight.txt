 it is evident that AmerisourceBergen (ABC) had a positive start to fiscal 2017. However, despite the company's strong quarterly results, there are several key financial metrics that warrant an 'underweight' investment stance.

Revenue growth was 4% for the quarter, with pharmaceutical distribution accounting for the majority of the growth. However, it is important to note that there was one less business day in the current quarter compared to the previous year, impacting revenue growth. While adjusted gross profit increased by 1%, it was entirely due to growth in the other segment, as the pharmaceutical distribution segment experienced a decline.

Operating expenses were managed well, remaining flat compared to the previous year. However, adjusted operating income only increased by 2%, with the pharmaceutical distribution segment bringing down the overall operating margin by three basis points. Interest expense also increased, primarily due to higher borrowings outstanding.

The adjusted income tax rate decreased to 33.1% due to a change in the mix of U.S. versus international income. Despite a solid 7% growth in adjusted diluted EPS, this growth was driven by the outstanding performance in the other segment, a lower diluted share count, and a favorable timing on manufacturer rebates. Share buybacks were also mentioned, with $890 million left on the share authorization.

Looking ahead, the company has revised its fiscal '17 outlook, raising its adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $5.72 to $5.92. While they are pleased with the strong Q1 results, the company expects the revenues to be at the high end of the previous guidance range of 6.5% to 8% due to new commercial business and improved brand inflation. However, they are revising the full-year OpEx growth rate to 4.5% to 6% and adjusting the operating income dollar growth to be flat to up 4% versus fiscal '16. Additionally, their adjusted share count is expected to creep up somewhat.

In summary, while AmerisourceBergen has shown positive quarterly results, the slower growth and headwinds in the pharmaceutical distribution segment, alongside the impact of interest expense and potential future changes in brand and generic drug pricing, suggest a cautious approach to investment in the company. The company's revised fiscal '17 outlook also raises concerns about the pace of growth and potential challenges in managing operating expenses. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended based on the reported key financial metrics.
