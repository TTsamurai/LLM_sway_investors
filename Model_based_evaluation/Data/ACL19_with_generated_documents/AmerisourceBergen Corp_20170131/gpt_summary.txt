Overall, in the recent earnings conference call, the company showcased a strong start to fiscal 2017, with better than expected results and positive business fundamentals. Revenues were up 4% to $38.2 billion, driven by growth in the pharmaceutical distribution segment and the ABSG specialty business. Adjusted gross profit increased by 1% to $1.1 billion, mainly due to growth in the other segment, while operating expenses were virtually flat compared to last year. Adjusted operating income increased by 2% to $486 million, with a margin of 1.27%, down three basis points from the prior year. The adjusted diluted EPS also showed solid growth of 7% to $1.36, driven by outstanding performance in the other segment, an improving tax rate, and a lower diluted share count.

Segment results further revealed that the pharmaceutical distribution segment saw solid growth in its retail customer segment, while ABSG had an overall revenue increase of 10%. However, segment operating income was down 2% due to anticipated headwinds in the drug company. The other segment, which includes Consulting Services, World Courier, and MWI Animal Health, had an outstanding quarter with an operating income of $112 million, marking the first time the segment surpassed $100 million in operating income.

In terms of updated fiscal '17 expectations, the company raises its adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $5.72 to $5.92, reflecting growth of 2% to 5% versus last fiscal year. Revised revenue growth and operating expenses expectations were highlighted, with a focus on managing costs and supporting revenue ramp. Meanwhile, the company expects its share count to creep up somewhat due to front-end loaded share repurchases.

Key assumptions related to the pharmaceutical drug pricing environment were also discussed. While generic deflation ranges remained unchanged at minus 7% to minus 9%, the company comfortable with the 7% to 9% brand inflation rate assumption for the full year.

Financial guidance for free cash flow and CapEx remained consistent, with an expectation of positive free cash flow in the March quarter and affirmed CapEx of around $500 million.

Overall, the company remains optimistic about its strong Q1 results and reaffirmed guidance for fiscal '17.
