 Overall, the recent earnings call for the company AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC) highlighted positive results and raised expectations for fiscal 2017. However, there are several factors that are cause for skepticism and caution when considering an investment in the company. 

First, while the company reported revenue growth of 4%, it is important to note that this growth was largely attributed to the pharmaceutical distribution segment, with other segments showing only modest growth or decline. This dependence on a single segment for revenue growth could be a red flag for investors, as it indicates a lack of diversification in the company's revenue streams.

Additionally, the company's segment operating income was down 2% and adjusted operating margin was down three basis points from the prior year, largely driven by challenges in the pharmaceutical distribution segment. This shows that the company is facing profitability issues in its core business segment, which could impact future earnings and overall performance.

Furthermore, the company's working capital investment with its largest customer, Walgreens, resulted in negative free cash flow of $570 million. This substantial cash outflow, combined with the need to repay a $600 million debt obligation that matures in May 2017, raises concerns about the company's liquidity and ability to meet its financial obligations.

Moreover, the company's reliance on brand pricing and generic deflation assumptions for its fiscal '17 expectations is a cause for skepticism. While the company's assumptions about brand pricing and generic deflation have been consistent, there is still uncertainty surrounding the pharmaceutical drug pricing environment, which could impact the company's future financial performance.

In conclusion, based on the cautious and skeptical perspective offered during the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on AmerisourceBergen Corporation. The company's overreliance on a single segment for revenue growth, profitability challenges, negative free cash flow, and uncertain outlook for pharmaceutical drug pricing all raise concerns about the company's financial health and future prospects.
