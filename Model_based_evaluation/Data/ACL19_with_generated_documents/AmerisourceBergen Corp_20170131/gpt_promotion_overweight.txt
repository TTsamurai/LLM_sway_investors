Based on the recent earnings call, the company has shown impressive Q1 results and revised their fiscal '17 outlook. With increased revenues and adjusted EPS, the company shows promising growth potential. The pharmaceutical distribution segment has contributed significantly to the revenue growth, particularly the ABSG specialty business that continues to see excellent revenue growth. The company has also shown strong progress in managing operating expenses and anticipates a positive cash flow in the coming quarters. With a solid start to the fiscal year and a clear focus on delivering outstanding service, solutions, and value to its customers, the company is poised for long-term shareholder value.

Based on these factors, I would recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The prospects for revenue growth, improved operating expenses, and a positive fiscal '17 outlook make the company a compelling investment opportunity. The consistent top-line growth in the pharmaceutical distribution segment, along with improvements in the other segment, indicates the company's ability to capitalize on positive industry trends. Additionally, the company's focus on managing costs and improving operating efficiency further strengthens the case for an overweight investment stance.
