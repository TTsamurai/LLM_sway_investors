 summary report:

Lennar Corporation reported strong earnings for the third quarter despite the impact of hurricanes in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico. The company's for-sale core homebuilding operations saw a 12% increase in deliveries and improvements in gross and net margins. The company also saw success with digital marketing efforts, generating over 115,000 leads, and reducing advertising spend to only 40 basis points of revenue.

The integration of the WCI acquisition has been seamless, and the company continues to focus on cash flow and balance sheet management. Lennar's Financial Services segment contributed operating earnings of over $49 million, and the Multifamily Communities segment has exceeded expectations.

The company continues to focus on technology initiatives to improve operational efficiency, such as a dynamic pricing tool and digital marketing efforts. While the impact of the hurricanes will delay some progress in the fourth quarter, Lennar is well positioned to capitalize on strong market conditions in the future.

The company is optimistic about future growth and is focused on maximizing return on equity and capital. Lennar's management team is confident in the long-term performance of the company and is dedicated to executing their business strategy.

The company is taking a cautious approach to providing guidance for 2018, as the impact of the hurricanes and market conditions settle. Delays in construction and materials are expected, but the company remains focused on efficient and effective execution.

Overall, Lennar Corporation continues to demonstrate strength and resilience in the face of challenges, and remains well positioned for future growth and success. As a financial analyst, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance based on the company's strong performance and strategic initiatives.
