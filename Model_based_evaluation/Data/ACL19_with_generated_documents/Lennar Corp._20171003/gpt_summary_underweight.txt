. Thank you for your attention to those comments. Now, moving forward, let me provide a detailed summary report on the recent earnings conference call transcript, adopting an 'underweight' investment stance.

First and foremost, the earnings report highlights the impact of natural disasters, including Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma, and Hurricane Maria, as well as the tragic events in Las Vegas, on the company's operations. These events have affected Lennar's business and could potentially lead to delays in construction and home deliveries, which may impact the company's financial performance in the short term.

In terms of key financial metrics, the company reported healthy earnings for the third quarter, with new order increases of 8% in volume and 12% in revenues. However, the impact of the hurricanes may result in approximately 950 closings being pushed from 2017 into 2018, leading to a temporary impact on the company's margins.

The company's balance sheet was mentioned as a focus, with a debt to total cap of 39.6%, which represents an improvement of 30 basis points over last year. The CFO emphasized the importance of maintaining a 7% to 10% growth target and driving operating costs down to improve bottom line and cash flow.

The financial services segment also contributed operating earnings of over $49 million, but profits and projections were down slightly from last year due to storm impacts and the slowdown in the refi business. Additionally, the multifamily communities segment, Lennar's apartment segment, generated $9.1 million of earnings in the third quarter.

The Rialto segment, however, experienced a decrease in performance, with a contribution of $3.2 million to the bottom line compared to $5.9 million a year ago. The CFO mentioned the direct investments as a drag on overall performance but reassured that the remaining assets are expected to be monetized over the next two quarters.

Overall, the company expressed optimism for the future and highlighted the long-term growth potential in the market. However, the impact of the hurricanes on construction delays, material shortages, and potential margin impact create uncertainty for the company's financial performance in the near term.

In conclusion, considering the potential short-term challenges and uncertainties, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended for Lennar Corporation. This reflects a cautious approach towards the company's financial performance in light of the recent events and potential headwinds in the market. It is important to closely monitor the company's ability to navigate through these challenges and mitigate any negative impact on its financial metrics.
