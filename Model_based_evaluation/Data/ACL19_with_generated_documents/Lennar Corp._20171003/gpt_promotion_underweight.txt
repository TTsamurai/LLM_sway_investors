 in it 2017. Thank you.

Based on the company's recent earnings call, there are several factors that suggest a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company, leading to a recommendation of an 'underweight' investment stance. Here are some key points to consider:

1. Impact of Hurricane Activity: The recent active hurricane season has affected the company's business, resulting in delays in home closings and affecting margins. Approximately 950 closings will be pushed from 2017 into 2018, impacting the trajectory of margins in the short term.

2. Supply Chain Disruptions: The hurricanes have caused disruptions in the supply chain, leading to delays in obtaining materials and impacting construction timelines. This has the potential to impact the company's ability to meet its delivery and revenue targets in the short term.

3. Economic uncertainty: The company's cautious approach to providing guidance for 2018 suggests that economic and market conditions are not stable. The impact of storm activity on construction costs and labor availability is likely to affect the company's performance in the coming months.

4. Market Volatility: The company's reluctance to provide immediate guidance for 2018 amidst the turmoil suggests a lack of clarity on future performance and potential market volatility.

In light of these factors, a prudent investment approach would be to adopt an 'underweight' stance on the company's stock, considering the short-term challenges it faces due to the impact of natural disasters and economic uncertainties. It is recommended to closely monitor the company's performance in the coming quarters before considering a more significant investment.
