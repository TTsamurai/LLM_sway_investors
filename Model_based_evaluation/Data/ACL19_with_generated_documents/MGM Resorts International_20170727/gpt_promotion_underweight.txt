 if you'd like to follow up. Thank you very much. I would recommend an 'underweight' investment stance based on the comments made during the earnings call. The company's focus on maximizing profitability and margins by shifting occupancy away from higher ADR, suggests a potential impact on RevPAR. Additionally, the emphasis on transforming properties and driving profitability through non-gaming revenue channels may result in potential volatility in the company's financial performance. Lastly, the company's reliance on upcoming major events, such as fights and conventions, for revenue growth may indicate a level of uncertainty in the company's future earnings. These factors together may warrant a cautious approach to investing in the company at this time.
