. I hope this comprehensive summary of our recent earnings conference call transcript provides insight into our company's performance and outlook. Based on the financial metrics discussed, I recommend adopting an 'overweight' investment stance with a focus on the significant growth potential in our Southeast and West groups. The strong pricing and gross margin improvements, especially in aggregates product lines, suggest a favorable outlook for future financial performance. Despite temporary disruptions from weather events and labor shortages, our long-term focus on safety, cost discipline, and operational excellence positions us well to capitalize on the durable, multi-year construction recovery. Our ongoing commitment to disciplined capital allocation and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases further supports long-term value creation. Additionally, the expected closure of the acquisition of Bluegrass Materials Company in the first half of 2018 presents an opportunity for growth and expansion. I am confident in the company's ability to navigate through challenges and capitalize on the emerging growth opportunities in the construction sector. Thank you for considering our company for investment.
