As a financial analyst, the key financial metrics that stand out to me from the earnings conference call transcript are the following:

1. Gross Bookings Growth: The company reported a 27% growth in room nights booked in Q1, with gross bookings growing by 24% expressed in U.S. dollars and by about 27% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. This indicates a strong start to the year.

2. Gross Profit: The gross profit for the quarter was $2.3 billion, growing by 16% in U.S. dollars and by about 17% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. However, the gross profit as a percentage of gross bookings for Q1 was 84 bps lower than the prior year Q1.

3. Operating Income and Margin: GAAP operating income grew by 1% and GAAP operating margins decreased by 341 bps compared to Q1 last year. This decrease was due mainly to performance advertising.

4. Cash Flow: The company generated $381 million of cash from operations during the first quarter of 2017, which is an increase of about 10%. They also returned $212 million to their shareholders through share buybacks.

5. Forecasted Growth: The company is forecasting booked room nights to grow by 16% to 21% and total gross bookings to grow by 12% to 17% in U.S. dollars and by 15% to 20% on a constant currency basis for the second quarter of 2017.

6. EBITDA and EPS: The adjusted EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $635 million, growing by 4% versus prior year, while GAAP net income and fully diluted EPS both increased by 22%. The company has also provided guidance for GAAP EPS between $12.55 to $13.25 per share for Q2, which, at the midpoint, is up by about 11% versus prior year.

7. Market Share and Advertising Efficiency: The company believes it is gaining market share in the U.S. and internationally through outstanding organic execution by its brands. Advertising and other revenue grew by 8% in Q1 compared to the prior year.

Based on the provided insights, the company's performance in the first quarter of 2017 seems to be strong, with significant growth in certain key financial metrics. However, it is important to consider the potential impact of the Easter holiday shift into Q2, which is expected to negatively impact growth rates as well as gross profit, operating profit, EBITDA, net income, and profit margins in Q1. It is also noted that while the company expects performance advertising ROI pressure to continue in Q2, they are comfortable with their growth forecast for the first half of the year.

Taking into account the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, I would recommend adopting an 'underweight' investment stance due to the potential impact of the Easter holiday shift on the company's financial performance. Additionally, the forecasted ROI pressure on performance advertising in Q2 may impact the company's bottom line. Therefore, it is important to closely monitor the company's performance in the upcoming quarters to assess its ability to sustain growth in key financial metrics.
