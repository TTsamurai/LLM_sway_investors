Based on the recent earnings call from The Priceline Group, there are a number of factors to consider when recommending an investment stance on the company. 

Firstly, it is important to note that the non-GAAP figures for Q1 results and Q2 forecast include stock-based compensation and do not reflect a reduction to income tax expense related to available NOLs. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results is detailed in the earnings release, indicating a potential lack of transparency in the company's financial reporting. 

Despite the company reporting a strong start to 2017, there are several factors which may indicate caution for potential investors. These include the impact of the shift of Easter into Q2, which had a slightly beneficial impact on Q1 gross bookings growth, but is expected to have an offsetting negative impact on Q2 gross bookings growth. Additionally, the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of gross bookings for Q1, along with the impact of the shift of Easter from Q1 to Q2 on gross profit, operating profit, EBITDA, net income, and profit margins, may be cause for concern.

Furthermore, the company's forecast for Q2 indicates an expected decrease in GAAP operating margins expressed as operating income as a percentage of gross profit, along with an assumption of year-over-year pressure on performance marketing ROIs. The company also forecasted more ROI pressure in Q2 and an increase in brand advertising and non-advertising expenses as part of their investment towards high travel season and innovation to drive future growth.

In addition, despite a strong euro and positive macro trends in the travel market, the forecast does not assume any significant change in macroeconomic conditions in general, or in the travel market in particular, which may be overly optimistic in the current economic climate.

Lastly, the decision of the company's CFO to retire after 14 years with the company, and the potential impact of this transition on the company's financial management, adds a level of uncertainty to an investment in the company.

Based on these factors, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on The Priceline Group, exercising caution and skepticism in light of the latest earnings call and forecast.
