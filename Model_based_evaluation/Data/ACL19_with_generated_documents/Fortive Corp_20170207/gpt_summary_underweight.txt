Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, Fortive reported solid financial performance with 2016 being a remarkable year in terms of sales and earnings growth. The company showed over 3% core revenue growth, expanded core adjusted operating margin 90 basis points, and delivered free cash flow conversion of 129%. Adjusted net earnings grew by 3.6% over the prior year. The company also posted solid margin performance with gross margin expansion of 90 basis points and operating profit margin increasing to 20.8%. Overall, Fortive's financial metrics indicate positive growth and performance.

However, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance based on the following factors:
1. North American and Western European growth is showing signs of stabilization, but the company expects low single-digit revenue growth in developed markets. High growth markets are expected to accelerate to high-single digit growth, primarily driven by China and improved results in Latin America.
2. The integration of eMaint Enterprises is still in the early stages and expected to contribute to revenue growth in the future.
3. The company is initiating full year 2017 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $2.60 to $2.70, implying a growth of 7% at the high end of the guidance. While the guidance indicates growth, it falls short of a strong growth outlook.
4. Currency headwinds are anticipated to be a significant impact on the top line and EPS in 2017, indicating potential challenges in international markets.

In conclusion, while Fortive has shown positive financial metrics, the factors mentioned above lead to the recommendation of an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. This is based on the outlook for modest growth and potential challenges in certain regions, including currency headwinds impacting financial performance.
