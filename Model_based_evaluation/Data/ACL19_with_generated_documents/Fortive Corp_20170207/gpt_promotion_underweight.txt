Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on Fortive. While the company reported positive performance in 2016 and demonstrated growth in core sales and earnings, the cautious approach is advised due to a few factors:

- The company's adjusted net earnings of $237.7 million were up 3.6% over the prior year, but this includes a $0.04 additional investment that was guided last quarter. Adjusted net earnings per share would have grown 9% if not for the additional investments.

- Currency was an additional $0.01 headwind to adjusted EPS. Sales grew 3.3% to $1.6 billion, with core revenue increasing by 3.5%. However, acquisitions contributed to the growth during the fourth quarter, offset by unfavorable currency translation.

- While the company initiated a full-year 2017 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance of $2.60 to $2.70, implying 7% growth at the high-end of the guidance, it is important to note that they are anticipating currency to be a headwind of 100 basis points to 200 basis points to the top line and $0.05 to EPS.

- The company is heavily invested in growth and productivity initiatives, which may impact short-term profitability. They have a strong focus on M&A, but the timing and size of these transactions are uncertain.

Based on this information, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended. It is important to monitor the company's ability to navigate headwinds from currency and investments while achieving the projected growth in earnings. An underweight stance indicates that the company's potential for growth may not be significantly advantageous for investors.
