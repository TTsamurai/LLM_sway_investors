Based on the transcript of the recent earnings call, it's clear that the company is experiencing some challenges. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency and pricing, as well as the reduction in growth due to one less selling day, are concerning factors. Additionally, the warning letter received from the FDA related to the Sage acquisition and the continued supplier issues impacting results, indicate potential operational and regulatory risks. 
The company's investment in various initiatives such as ERP implementation, product growth platforms, and cost transformation for growth program, may lead to increased operating expenses in the short term, impacting the bottom line. The expected dilution related to the planned acquisition of NOVADAQ technologies further adds to the caution.
While the company has maintained a strong balance sheet with significant cash and marketable securities, the high level of debt is worth considering. 
Furthermore, the guidance for the third quarter and full year, including the potential negative impacts of foreign currency and accounting changes, suggest that the company's earnings may not meet expectations. The uncertainty surrounding the closing date of the NOVADAQ acquisition adds to the cautious outlook. 
Overall, based on the company's recent earnings call and guidance, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company.
