Based on the recent earnings call transcript, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company's second quarter financial results showed organic sales growth of 6.7%, with momentum in key divisions such as Orthopedics, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology. Additionally, the company delivered an adjusted quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.53, reflecting a 10.1% increase from the prior year.

The company's operating margin improved to 25% of sales, with a continued focus on operating expense control and investments in growth platforms. The adjusted effective tax rate of 16.3% reflects larger-than-anticipated benefits related to the adoption of changes in accounting for stock compensation expenses. The company also maintains a strong balance sheet with $3.7 billion in cash and marketable securities, and total debt of $7.4 billion.

Looking ahead, the company anticipates annual organic sales growth to be in the range of 6.5% to 7% for 2017, with an expected range of adjusted net earnings per diluted share of $6.45 to $6.55. The company also has a cost transformation program in place, which is expected to drive savings of 30 to 50 basis points over the next few years.

In summary, the company's recent financial performance, strong operating margin, effective tax rate, and strategic cost transformation program suggest a favorable outlook for investor consideration. It is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on the company based on its recent earnings call and financial results.
