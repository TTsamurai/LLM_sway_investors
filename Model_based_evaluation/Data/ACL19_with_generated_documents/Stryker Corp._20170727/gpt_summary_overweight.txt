Based on the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, the company has demonstrated strong financial performance in the second quarter, with organic sales growth of 6.7% and adjusted quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.53, reflecting a 10.1% increase from the prior year. The growth was driven by strong performance in key divisions such as Orthopaedics, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology, with international organic sales growth of 5.5%.

The company also reported a strong adjusted gross margin of 66.3% and adjusted operating margin of 25% of sales, indicating favorable leverage and operational improvements. Additionally, the company has a strong balance sheet with $3.7 billion of cash and marketable securities, and total debt on the balance sheet was $7.4 billion.

Looking ahead, the company expects annual organic sales growth to be in the range of 6.5% to 7% for 2017, and adjusted net earnings per diluted share is now expected to be in the range of $6.45 to $6.55 per share, excluding any anticipated dilution related to the planned acquisition of NOVADAQ technologies.

The company's operating margin improvement is expected to be approximately 30 to 50 basis points, driven by cost transformation initiatives and strategic investments in growth platforms such as the Mako TKA platform. The company also anticipates an effective tax rate ranging from 16% to 17% in the second half of the year.

In summary, based on the strong financial performance, favorable operating margins, and strategic growth initiatives, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company's positive outlook, strong balance sheet, and potential for continued growth make it an attractive investment opportunity.
