Based on the recent earnings call from Seagate, it is clear that the company is performing well and is positioned for growth in the HDD market. Key points to highlight include:

- Revenue and margin results year-over-year were strong, driven by higher capacity products across the HDD portfolio.
- HDD enterprise revenues were up, reflecting exabyte growth and representing a significant portion of total consolidated revenue.
- Revenues from high-capacity growth opportunities in consumer, surveillance, DDR, and NAS markets were up significantly year-over-year, representing a substantial portion of total consolidated revenue.
- Operating expenses were slightly higher than forecast due to non-executive variable compensation, but the overall balance sheet remains healthy with $3 billion in cash and cash equivalents.
- Successful completion of a debt offering of $1.25 billion of investment-grade financing with a weighted average interest rate of less than 5%, reflecting strong financial capabilities.

Based on these points, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on Seagate. The company's strong performance, growth potential in key markets, and healthy financial position all point towards a positive outlook for investors. Seagate's ability to generate strong cash flow from its storage portfolio and the potential for continued growth in 2017 and beyond make it an attractive investment opportunity.
