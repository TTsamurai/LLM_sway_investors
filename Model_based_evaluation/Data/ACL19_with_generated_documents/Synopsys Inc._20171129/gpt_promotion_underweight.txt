. Thank you for your excellent report. Based on the recent earnings call of Synopsys, it is clear that the company has achieved outstanding financial results and has a strong market position. However, there are a few cautious points to consider before making an investment decision.

First, while the company has achieved impressive revenue and earnings growth, it is important to note that much of this growth has been driven by acquisitions. The company has made significant investments in expanding its market reach through acquisitions such as Cigital and Black Duck Software.

Additionally, the company's growth is reliant on the global economy and the strength of the semiconductor industry. While these factors have been favorable in recent years, the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry and the potential impact of economic downturns should be taken into consideration.

Furthermore, while the company's focus on software security and the automotive industry presents growth opportunities, it also introduces new risks and challenges. The company's expansion into these areas may require extensive investments and resources to fully capitalize on the opportunities.

In conclusion, while Synopsys has shown strong performance and market positioning, the reliance on acquisitions, economic factors, and new growth areas warrant a cautious approach to investment. Therefore, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company at this time. Thank you.
