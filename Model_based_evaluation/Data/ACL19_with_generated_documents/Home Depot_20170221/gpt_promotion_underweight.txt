Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. Although sales for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year increased by 5.8% to $22.2 billion, the impact of foreign currency rates and the stronger U.S. dollar negatively affected total sales growth. Additionally, there was a decrease in total company gross margin and an increase in operating expenses. Although the company saw a 23.1% increase in diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter and an 18.1% increase for the year, there are concerns about expense leverage and rising wages. The company's guidance for fiscal 2017 indicates a projected decline in gross margin rate, increased expenses, and a 30 basis points growth in the operating margin to reach a target one year in advance. This indicates a more cautious outlook for the company's financial performance. Additionally, the company's capital allocation plan and return to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends may not be sustainable considering the projected expenses and capital spending. Therefore, it is advisable to approach an investment in the company with caution.
