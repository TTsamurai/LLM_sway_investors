- **Operating Expenses:** Operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved significantly, decreasing by 92 basis points to 20% for the year, helped by good expense control practices and levelling off of costs related to a past payment data breach.

- **Expense Growth Correlation:** Foreseen to grow at 49% of the sales growth rate, reflecting ongoing investments and recurring costs like wages and medical expenses.
