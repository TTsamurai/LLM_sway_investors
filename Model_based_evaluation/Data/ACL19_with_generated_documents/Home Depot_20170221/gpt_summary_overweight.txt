2. Gross Margin: The gross margin for the quarter was 34%, with an 8 basis points expansion in the supply chain. For the year, the company experienced a 3 basis points contraction in gross margin.

3. Operating Expenses: Operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 113 basis points to 20.8% in the fourth quarter. For the year, operating expenses decreased by 92 basis points from the previous year.

4. Operating Margin: The operating margin for the quarter was 13.2% and for the year was 14.2%. The company is projecting its operating margin to grow by approximately 30 basis points to 14.5% for fiscal 2017.

The company expects its fiscal 2017 diluted earnings per share to grow approximately 10.5% to $7.13.

6. Capital Allocation: The company generated approximately $9.8 billion of cash from operations in fiscal 2016 and is planning to use that cash, as well as proceeds from debt issuance, to invest in the business, repurchase shares, and pay dividends to shareholders.

Based on these financial metrics and the positive outlook for the company provided in the earnings conference call, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance. The company's strong sales growth, improved gross margin, effective expense control, and projected growth in diluted earnings per share indicate that the company is well-positioned for continued success.
