Based on the recent earnings call, the company's management discussed their strategy for long-term growth and discussed the challenges they face in entering the 5G market. The company's focus on building assets for future cash flow and their cautious approach to building out their network indicates a longer-term horizon for potential growth. Additionally, the company's admission that they are not the biggest player in the industry and will need help to implement 5G technology suggests potential challenges in competing with larger, more established competitors. The company's cautious and strategic approach to 5G implementation, as well as their focus on long-term growth rather than short-term gains, may indicate slower and more moderate growth potential for the company, leading to a recommendation of an 'underweight' investment stance. Investors should approach the company with cautious skepticism given the uncertainty surrounding the implementation of 5G technology and the company's long-term growth strategy.
