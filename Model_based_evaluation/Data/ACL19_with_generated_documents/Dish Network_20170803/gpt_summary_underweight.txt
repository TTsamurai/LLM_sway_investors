Based on the earnings conference call transcript, it appears that DISH is adopting a long-term approach to building assets and generating cash flow. They are focusing on connectivity and have been active in government auctions to acquire spectrum for 5G technology. However, the building out of the network and spectrum usage is expected to be a long-term process, with potential implementations not expected until 2020-2022.

In terms of the OTT (over-the-top) business, it was noted that it is a growing industry, but also stated that it is a seasonal business with sports and HBO being key drivers. The company is looking to differentiate its offerings and sees potential for growth in this area.

DISH also expressed interest in potential mergers and acquisitions, with a more favorable regulatory environment being a catalyst for increased M&A activity in the future. The company is open to working with like-minded partners and believes that strategic alliances may present opportunities in the future.

In terms of financial metrics, the company is focused on long-term return on investment and cash flow generation. The slow progress on network build-out, litigation over spectrum, and uncertainties around the availability of certain frequency bands have presented challenges. However, the company remains optimistic about the future potential of IoT and the connectivity business, and is actively studying potential strategies to navigate the evolving industry landscape. Their financial stance appears to be cautious, as they are preparing for long-term investments and potential partnership opportunities while carefully considering regulatory and market uncertainties. Therefore, the company is currently adopting an 'underweight' investment stance.
