Based on the recent earnings call, it is clear that the company is positioning itself for future growth and success. The company has demonstrated a proactive approach by filing an application to potentially participate as a bidder for spectrum assets in the broadcast incentive auction. This shows a commitment to investing in and expanding their business.

Furthermore, the company's management has been prudent in acknowledging the risks associated with forward-looking statements, and it is evident that they are focused on providing transparency to investors.

In light of these developments, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on this company. The proactive steps taken by the company and the potential for future growth make it an attractive investment opportunity. Investors should carefully consider the risks described in the company's reports, but the potential rewards make this company a compelling choice for investment.

In conclusion, the recent earnings call provides a strong indication of the company's commitment to growth and success. I believe that an 'overweight' investment stance is warranted based on the company's proactive measures and potential for future success.
