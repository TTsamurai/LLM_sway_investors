Thank you for the introduction. In the recent earnings conference call, the company highlighted its participation in the broadcast incentive auction, filing an application to potentially participate as a bidder for spectrum assets. However, due to the FCC's anti-collusion rules, no further information was provided on this matter.

As a financial analyst, it is important to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance based on key financial metrics from the call. In the absence of detailed financial figures, it is essential to focus on historical results and potential risks mentioned in the 10-K report. The cautionary statements made during the call also indicate potential risks and uncertainties that could impact future financial results.

Given the lack of specific financial metrics discussed in the call, it is advisable to carefully consider the risks described in the 10-K report and exercise caution when evaluating any forward-looking statements from the company. It is also important to refrain from placing undue reliance on such statements, as the company assumes no responsibility for updating them.

In conclusion, the company's participation in the broadcast incentive auction and the potential impact on its future financial results should be closely monitored. However, the lack of detailed financial information in the recent earnings call and the presence of unknown risks and uncertainties warrant an 'underweight' investment stance at this time. Further analysis and monitoring of the company's financial performance and developments in the incentive auction process are recommended before making investment decisions.
