On the gross margin side, we've got a cost that was a little bit higher on the freight and we also had PetSense driving margin a little bit in the back half, so that paired with more normalized weather assumption as well. Those are the key factors that drove our adjustments. So, if you have any other specific questions, we'd be glad to help answer them.
