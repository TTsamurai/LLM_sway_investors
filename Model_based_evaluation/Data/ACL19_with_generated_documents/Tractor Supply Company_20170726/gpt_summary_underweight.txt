 this year. And then, also, the tax rate, as I mentioned, the 50-basis-point increase to 36.7% to 36.9%, those are the key factors that drove the adjustments for the full year guidance. And just on average diluted shares outstanding, we continue to buy back shares. We acquired 3.8 million shares for $248 million. So when you factor in the difference in what the diluted says outstanding would have been for the year, it's at about 128.2 million to 128.8 million average diluted shares outstanding for the year. Those are the factors that contributed to the revised full year guidance. Thank you. That's all the time we have for questions. We would like to turn the call back to management for any further remarks. Thank you. This concludes our second quarter conference call. We appreciate your participation today, and we look forward to updating you on third quarter results in November. Thank you. Goodbye.
