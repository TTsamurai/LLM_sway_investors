I appreciate the information you have shared from the recent earnings call. Based on the details provided, it is clear that the company is facing challenges, and there are several reasons to be cautious about their future performance.

First, the company's year-over-year net sales and net income have only shown a modest increase. Despite positive comparable store sales growth, there are important factors to consider, such as the impact of calendar shifts and a reduction in sales days. Additionally, the company's gross margin has decreased, and its operating expenses have deleveraged, resulting in a decline in operating margin.

The company's revised outlook for the full year fiscal 2017 also reveals a lower expectation for sales and net income, with an anticipated decline in operating margin. This is due to factors such as deflation impacting same-store sales and higher expenses related to technology investments and store payroll hours.

Furthermore, the company's capital expenditures have shifted, and there is uncertainty regarding future investments and operating margin growth.

Given these factors, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance with regards to this company, as their performance may not meet expectations and could potentially face further challenges in the future. It is important to closely monitor their progress and re-evaluate the investment stance as more information becomes available.
