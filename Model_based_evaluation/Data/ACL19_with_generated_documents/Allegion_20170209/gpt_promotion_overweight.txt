Recommendation: Based on the company's recent earnings call and the information provided in the transcripts, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Allegion. The company reported strong organic growth, improved pricing, and significant progress with new product introductions and channel strategies. Their adjusted operating margin of 17.9% and EBITDA margin of 20.5% demonstrate excellent performance and operational margin improvement. Additionally, their available cash flow increased by 50.8% compared to the prior-year period, and they have a balanced and flexible approach to capital allocation.

Furthermore, the company anticipates revenue growth above market levels for 2017, driven by their channel initiatives and new product development. They also plan to continue making investments for future profitable growth and have the opportunity to provide shareholder distributions through increased dividends and share repurchases.

Overall, Allegion's strong performance, growth opportunities, and capital deployment options make them an attractive investment opportunity. Therefore, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended.
