Thank you for the detailed information from the conference call. Based on the financial metrics discussed, here is my summary report:

Revenue Growth: The company delivered 5.2% and 5.8% organic growth in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively, reflecting improved markets, new product introductions, and channel initiatives. Pricing was favorable in the quarter, with a strong performance in both non-residential and residential businesses in the Americas region.

Reported Net Revenues: Fourth quarter reported net revenues were $569.7 million, reflecting an increase of 4.4% versus the prior year and a 5.2% organic growth. Americas had a particularly strong performance, with solid growth in both non-residential and residential businesses.

Adjusted Operating Income and Margins: Adjusted operating income of $102 million and adjusted operating margin of 17.9% declined 1.4% and 110 basis points, respectively, when compared to the prior year. Excluding the environmental remediation charge, the underlying operational improvement was driven by solid incremental volume leverage and continued progress on the EMEIA margin transformation.

Earnings Per Share (EPS): The adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $0.81 per share. Operational results increased EPS by $0.16, offset by reductions from interest and other income, adjusted effective tax rate, incremental investments, and acquisitions, net of divestitures.

Regional Performance: Americas region had strong revenue growth and adjusted operating income, with solid performance in both non-residential and residential products. EMEIA region reported solid revenue growth and adjusted operating income and margin improvements, representing a significant improvement in operational results. Asia-Pacific region reported lower revenues, impacted by the timing of orders and large non-recurring projects in 2015.

Cash Flow and Capital Allocation: Available cash flow for 2016 increased by 50.8% compared to the prior year, primarily attributable to higher net earnings. The company reduced its gross debt to adjusted EBITDA to 2.9 times, reflecting a balanced and flexible capital allocation strategy, including increased dividends and share repurchases.

Outlook for 2017: The company expects revenue growth in 2017 to be driven by price improvements, volume growth, and investments in new product development and channel strategies. Margin expansion is anticipated through pricing realization, volume leverage, and productivity improvements.

In conclusion, the company demonstrated strong organic growth, favorable pricing, and improved operational performance in its key regions. The capital allocation strategy remains focused on driving growth and providing superior returns on invested capital, supported by the company's ability to generate consistent, high cash flow. The outlook for 2017 reflects optimism for revenue growth, margin expansion, and continued capital investments for future profitable growth.
