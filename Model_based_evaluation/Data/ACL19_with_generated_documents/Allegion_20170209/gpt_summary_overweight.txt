The company anticipates a robust revenue growth for 2017, as well as strong markets. The pricing and volume-related revenue growth is expected to be above the market average. Allegion also expects to manage incremental investments to ensure top-line growth and margin expansion in both quarters of the year.

In terms of capital allocation, Allegion plans to maintain a balanced and flexible approach, with a focus on acquiring companies to take advantage of specific opportunities in market segmentation, expansion of the channel, discretionary market opportunity, and new product development.

As a financial analyst, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance on Allegion based on these positive financial metrics and the company's solid performance.
