Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is apparent that the company, Allegion, has demonstrated strong organic revenue growth, as well as operational margin improvement in all regions. With a focus on new product development and channel strategies, the company has managed to offset the impacts of rising commodity prices and foreign currency headwinds. The company's disciplined pricing actions have been effective in mitigating these challenges and have resulted in favorable pricing in the Americas region. This has contributed to strong revenue growth and operational margin improvement.

Looking ahead, the company anticipates that its pricing actions will continue to offset the increase in commodity costs, leading to robust revenue growth for 2017. The company expects to grow above the market average, driven by channel initiatives, new product development, and traction gained from new initiatives. It also anticipates margin expansion and steady improvement in productivity.

In terms of capital deployment, the company is focused on a balanced and flexible approach, with opportunities to fund incremental investments for channel strategies, new product development, and demand creation. Additionally, the company plans to continue its focus on growing its portfolio through acquisitions and providing shareholder distributions through increased dividends and share repurchases.

Overall, the future outlook for Allegion appears positive, with a strong revenue growth outlook for 2017, as well as a continued focus on margin improvement and capital deployment. Based on these insights, I adopt an 'overweight' investment stance on the company.
