Based on the recent earnings call, there are several reasons to exercise caution when considering an investment in Allegion. While the company reported strong organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter and full year, there are a number of factors that should give investors pause.

First, foreign currency was a headwind for the company, particularly in the EMEIA region. Additionally, divestitures were a slight headwind in the fourth quarter, offsetting the impact of acquisitions for the full year. This indicates some volatility in the company's revenue sources.

Moreover, while the company reported positive operating income and margin improvements, it's important to note that these numbers were impacted by a $15 million environmental remediation charge, which had a significant impact on the adjusted operating margin.

Furthermore, while revenue growth was strong in the Americas region, the Asia-Pacific region saw a decline in revenues. This suggests that Allegion's growth is not consistent across all regions.

Additionally, while the company's capital allocation strategy seems focused on providing returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, there are significant investments being made in channel strategies, new product development, and demand creation. This indicates that the company may be sacrificing short-term returns for long-term growth, which could impact immediate shareholder value.

Finally, the company anticipates increased price movements due to rising commodity costs in 2017, which may impact margins and profitability.

Based on these factors, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on Allegion until there is more stability and consistency in the company's performance across all regions and a clearer picture of the impact of rising commodity costs on the company's margins.
