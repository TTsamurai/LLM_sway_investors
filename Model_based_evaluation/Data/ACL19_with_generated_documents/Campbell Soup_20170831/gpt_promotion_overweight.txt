. We have new packaging, graphics and a revitalization of the Swanson brand. We believe that those will be important differentiation points as well as the repositioning of our strategic market. So we’re realistic about the impact of private label, but we also feel very good about our ability to innovate and differentiate in the marketplace. Thank you. We continue to have very strong margins in the category and I believe as I just mentioned, we’ll be able to manage through any impacts of private label by holding true to our quality and differentiation points. Thank you. Hi, Jason. The relationship with Walmart is a valuable one. And as it – if it doesn’t have become clear, one of the big things that we’ve done this year and it was a big reset with our sales force is to integrate sales and marketing resources, which puts us more solidly in the performance with the strong data and shopper insights that we’ve collected in the bakings space that we’ve historically done but are doing much more tightly now to guide us in platform merchandising. So – and to really effectuate a much more strategic partnership and collaboration. So we are doing our business planning now with Walmart. We have strong plans in place and we are on track for what we plan to do in the Walmart environment. Thank you. Yes, the U.S. beverage market is competitive undoubtedly. And I think what we see, particularly with the V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash, is a lot of consumer concern for calories and sugar. And so, in that sense, particular juices, fresh juices and functional beverages are taking demand away from those categories. So what we have done and the v8 100% vegetable juice, there we have the strongest relationship with our customers and we’re supporting the consumer consumption trends in that category, it’s growing there. And so what we’re doing, we have a robust program to talk about that and talk about that natural extension of the health and well-being aspect of our brand. And so, in effect, we’re seeing the v8 100% Vegetable Juice source their competition, that – it’s just a little bit healthier and it’s really – we’re kind of a victim of our innovation right now, because it’s soft is moving to the store perimeter. But the team, we have a broad portfolio and we have solid plans to – for us to better support the V8 V-Fusion and V8 Splash. Thank you. Yes, thank you. This – as we said, this was kind of in line with the U.S. soup sales in the U.S. And what we were really particularly and most impressed with was is in the ready-to-serve portion of our business, broth declined, but the bulk of our ready-to-serve portfolio is fully in line and that was the bulk of what we launched this year, which includes Well Yes! and the expansion of Chunky Maxx and Progressive and broths were – were particularly in line with the marketplace. As we look at our 2018 plan, we expect to continue to grow ready-to-serve and new products and we expect that to be the engine of our growth as we move forward. Come on now. Yes, we have higher forecasts for both, U.S. . We’re a big player in the U.S. And they – we’ve – we’ve backed fill this business and we’ve been very disciplined with our promotional spending. So, we have robust plans for both. I think that the challenging part is as these are the – we’re entering complex negotiations with our key retail partners and it’s times in the marketplace where there’s intense competition. And so, we’ve been fair with our pricing and we’ve been disciplined about our promotional spending and so we’ve got pretty solid plans in place. And so – so what we expect that we’ll be able to drive the gain for all the – for both of these. But that said, it’s just a tough environment right now. It’s hypercompetitive. And so, we do expect – we expect to actually make some concessions in the market. So a short answer would be, both are good categories. However, we did expect that there will be slight declines in fiscal 2018. Yes, hi. As we said in our prepared remarks, we do believe that freshness is – the growth in fresh foods especially in produce along with the shifts in consumer demographics and shopping behavior is – is natural under return. As consumers especially in looking for more convenient products and certainly in C-Fresh. As consumers continue to seek better-for-you and more on-trend options, we see that as coming back to the business that’s delivering now and expanding. So we’re confident that our business will return to profitable growth. And so we’re looking at kind of the following areas. We mentioned that this relates to our portfolio strategy which includes bottled and refrigerated, both of which are expansion areas and then kind of as we pointed out, our return to normal promotional activity. We have a robust – we’ve also identified a robust pipeline of new product development. And then we also are expanding our distribution for the – for the Garden Fresh Gourmet sauces and for the Garden Fresh Gourmet soups. However, despite these investments in the business, we do believe that that category for the year will return to profitable growth and we’re – we anticipate that the fresh business will grow profitably in 2018. Thank you. So we saw slightly increases in the sector sales and the slight increase in the sale of our single-serve products where we had a variety of new ones. And the visibility now on our food items. We also saw growth with our Gelato-inspired varieties of Tim Tam biscuits. Importantly, we believe that our, Ahmed, that our new rate-to-serve as well as our development of new products and our plan to return to normal promotional activity in the first quarter, we still believe on the fiscal year where C-Fresh will return to profitability. At this time, it’s pretty tight because our U.S. condition continues – consistent with what we saw during the fiscal year and the growth of our [indiscernible] international business. Greetings, Sonny. I would say that Better-For-You Soaps including Secondly, we have a regression of new product both in the healthy and well-being area. I mentioned the success of the Well, Yes! Line and in our [indiscernible] as well as our bulging to more natural and organic options in the coming year. Thank you. Well, regardless of what’s going on with the customers, we are optimistic about the upcoming soap and we have a very robust amount of innovation coming as I’ve just outlined. We believe – this activity has led to us entering discussions with some new customers looking for new promotions as well as expanding our reach to regional customers. So we believe that our sims area will perform as well as our ready-to-serve soup portfolio has been performing. Thank you. So, obviously, the lack of retailer support and soup promotion means that we’ll be negatively impacted there as well as we have commented on earlier in previous question with volume traffic. But I do have to say, the soup team has created a lot of really exciting things. So, with the lot of new things we’re launching this quarter as I mentioned, the ‘Chunky Maxx’, a new variety – a new version of the Chunky line and the ‘Well, Yes!’ line as well read on ‘Well’, ‘Yes!’ which was delivered, ended the fiscal year in strong positive territory. So we’re optimistic that these new product launches, amongst our other promotions, will present a big lift for the upcoming year. And we continue to develop our customer dialogues and compensate to make sure that we have that we maximize our sales and profit opportunities and, indeed, we are optimistic that most of our products and schemes will be rolled out during the promotional year will be helpful to our business. Thank you so much. As you said, we see the business continuing to expand in 2018. We’re not exactly yet at quite the fiscal year and quite the fiscal year is coming up, but we anticipate that our brands will continue to demonstrate the same strong performances. Thank you. We believe we’re investing to accommodate the fact that we believe we’re investing to more health and well-being hubs.Sp Soon, to deal with what I was referring to earlier, the consumer shopping for a perimeter for foods and to a more snacking culture and as the e-commerce space grows we believe these segments represent a higher sales opportunity so we are focusing on these key areas for investment. Thank you. Well, obviously, we have the – Our provisions EBIT also excludes the pending acquisition of a Pacific Foods so it's really difficult to exactly pinpoint the corresponding numbers of market. Thank you. Yes, we have the befiting analysis because so many factors are involved in the final performance that Stephen and his team are so actively planning. Thank you. Yes, later we had a deal with our customers and since there was not an agreement on promotional plans, we expect our soap sales to be really impacted especially in the first half. We are working on an agreement with our customer, however, and we are doing everything we can to deliver of this win-win plan. Thank you. I think we can say that and so, as we enter into our soap season, our new plans are in certain and that being to win business and this way we can present them also. That includes our new real [indiscernible] campaign as well as new marketing campaigns with popular movie franchises and [indiscernible]. We let the go for the new line of soups as well. So, speaking of the soup season, we really want to continue to build and work along with our customers to effectuate the high performing status that we've had. Thank you. We remain good from the retail business and appreciate good from the level. Kenneth, we have fairly working with grocery soap and are ready to enter business plan to make some advancement in our U.S. soap and relatable product line. Thank you. Well, there are a few things to consider hee. So this year obviously negotiation are complex and especially in a year where there is intense competition in the marketplace. However, we know that these role players and categories are doing well. You can tell but the Well Yes! Line has performed strongly and got into the mid-year launch of the brand itself. Our Swanson broth has been shining and we’re adding more varieties. Thank you. Hi, William. So we’ve been preparing good margin performance and are really focused on gaining back our house brand. No doubts, private brand are a threat to custom brand, and we envision in four strategic area to keep us ahead in the marketplace. Thank you. Hi, Anthony. So, we’re [indiscernible] Walmart’s other grocery recasts in the same process. And as we mentioned, on a smaller lever we’re also dealing with outgrowth or brand with the stores that are looking to provide more into store brands that better align with consumer trends. Thank you. Well, private brands are not yet, but I do know that we’re continuing to develop our differentiation our brands further to see the opportunities that lie therein. Thank you. Hi, Evan. While we don’t comment on negotiations with customer, they are complex and most of us just don’t always happen. But I do believe that were ever taking a mindful path with our brands [indiscernible]. Thank you. Yes, retailers continue to plate and so the marketplace remains challenging and the retailer industrial environment is also incredibly competitive. But we have plans that are very strong and we have a robust lineup that we think will continue to move the brand and portfolio forward. Thank you.
