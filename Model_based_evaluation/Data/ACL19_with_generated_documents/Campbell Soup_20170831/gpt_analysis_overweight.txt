 and we believe that that will help insulate us. Thank you. Thank you for your question, Peter. Yes, there are definitely challenges in the beverage space with shifting consumer preferences and competition from other categories. We are investing in our V8 brand to improve performance, focusing on our core products, revitalizing V8 Blends, and driving growth in V8 +Energy. We see a lot of potential in the beverage category, especially with functional beverages and health and well-being trends. We are committed to navigating these challenges and finding opportunities for growth in this space. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. In summary, the company is facing a challenging operating environment, but we are confident in our strategic imperatives and growth agenda to address these challenges. With investments in key areas such as e-commerce, snacking, real food credentials, and health and well-being, we believe that the company is well-positioned for long-term growth. We are adopting an 'overweight' investment stance for the company, based on the insights and financial metrics derived from the recent earnings conference call transcript. We see potential for growth in Global Biscuits and Snacks and Campbell Fresh, and we believe that the company's strategic initiatives will drive positive performance in the future. Thank you.
