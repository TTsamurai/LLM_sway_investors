 and engage new consumers. In particular, we’ve been focused on communicating the quality of our product, as evidenced by our plan to convert all our soups to chicken with no antibiotics. We’ve also been investing in better-for-you innovations in packaging and our Ready-to-Eat Soup portfolio with our Well Yes! line. We believe that these efforts will differentiate our brands and continue to drive consumer preference for our products over private label offerings. Thank you. Thank you for your time. This concludes our call. 

As a financial analyst, the recent earnings conference call transcript presents a challenging operating environment for the food industry, including changing consumer preferences, increased competition, and impacts on sales growth. While the company has outlined strategic imperatives and plans to address these challenges, the fourth-quarter performance across divisions was mixed. Organic sales declined for Global Biscuits and Snacks, while Americas Simple Meals and Beverages also saw a decrease in sales. The underperformance of the Campbell Fresh division illustrates key executional issues that have impacted operating results, though modest sales growth was achieved.

From a financial perspective, the company reported an increase in adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS, signaling a potential for profitability despite the challenging operating environment. However, the company also highlighted the impact of one-time costs, such as higher carrot costs and increased expenses related to refining quality protocols, which led to an operating loss in the Campbell Fresh division. Additionally, the outlook for sales growth in the upcoming fiscal year varies across divisions, with expectations of decline in the Americas division and potential growth in Global Biscuits and Snacks and Campbell Fresh.

The company's focus on strategic investments in e-commerce, snacking, health and well-being, and real food credentials is aimed at driving future growth and mitigating short-term challenges. However, the uncertain outlook for U.S. soup sales and V8 beverages, as well as the pending acquisition of Pacific Foods, add complexity to the overall investment stance.

In light of these factors, it may be prudent to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company, as the challenging operating environment and mixed performance raise uncertainties about future growth and profitability. Key financial metrics to monitor would include organic sales growth, operating earnings, and the impact of strategic investments on the company's overall financial position. Additionally, tracking the execution of plans to address operational challenges and drive future growth will be critical in evaluating the company's performance in the coming fiscal year.
