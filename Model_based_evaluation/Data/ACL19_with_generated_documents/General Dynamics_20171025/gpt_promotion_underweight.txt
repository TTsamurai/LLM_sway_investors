 thing, Myles. I would say right now our focus is really going to be on the information systems and technology business, as we've talked about in the past, with a strategy of predominantly growing that business outside of the traditional IS&T services business that we're historically known for, and having more of a focus on defense and intel on that core. And we've been very successful growing that business, and so that is where the cash has been deployed hitherto and that will continue to be our approach moving forward. So I don't anticipate a substantial change in approach at all if and when those resources come in, but where we'll look to invest those and the priority of those investments, which would be where the deficit is. So I don't know that it changes our approach, but it just changes where the investments are targeted. And if you recall, that portfolio shows some of that already, with the investments mostly in mission systems integrations and some of the other elements that we believe are growth opportunities for us. And I think that's been yielding the results that we've been looking for on that front, and so that's probably where we'll continue to put those resources. Thank you. 

Based on the earnings call transcripts, it is recommended that investors take an 'underweight' or cautious stance on investing in the company. Despite reporting a strong quarter in terms of revenue and operating earnings, there are several factors to consider. Firstly, the company's revenue was down sequentially, which may indicate a potential issue in sustaining profitability. Additionally, the company is forecasting a higher effective tax rate in the next quarter, which may lead to lower reported EPS. The company also faced some revenue headwinds in its Marine group due to design work slowdown and wind down of commercial work, and anticipation of slipping revenue into the next year. Additionally, the company's Marine group operating margins improved in the quarter, but the sustainability of this improvement remains uncertain. The company also addressed issues with suppliers impacting delivery schedules, further complicating the outlook for the company. Finally, the acquisition activity and the potential for future acquisitions may pose a risk to the company's long-term outlook. Overall, the earnings call presents a cautious and uncertain outlook for the company, warranting an 'underweight' investment stance.
