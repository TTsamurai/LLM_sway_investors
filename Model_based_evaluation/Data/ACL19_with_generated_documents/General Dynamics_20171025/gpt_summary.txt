, Duncan. So certainly as we look at the year-to-date progress in operating performance, it's hard to argue with the fact that the businesses have done extremely well. As I look at aerospace and its strong year-to-date performance, we've really started to see Gulfstream as the primary driver of that growth with very strong order intake and excellent pipeline and sales discussions. Our certification flying continues to progress well and we're optimistic about our order intake in the fourth quarter. In terms of combat systems, the group has had an excellent quarter and continues to perform very well with strong operating margins. The same holds true for the Marine group with a very healthy backlog increase, particularly in the defense businesses. And IS&T has managed to overcome less than anticipated revenue with very strong operating performance. Looking ahead, for the next quarter we expect the operating earnings perspective to remain consistent, although we are expecting a higher effective tax rate which will lead to a lower reported EPS. We have increased our guidance for the year by $0.05, with EPS from continuing operations now in the range of $9.75 to $9.80. We expect our end of year guidance to be close to actual performance, and we will provide a detailed look at next year during our planning process later this fall. Thank you.
