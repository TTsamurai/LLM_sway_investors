Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, the company's performance in the third quarter and year-to-date has been positive, with sales and earnings outperforming expectations. Earnings per share were up 16% from last year, and net earnings grew to $274 million compared to $204 million in the prior year.

The company's sales rose 8% to $3.3 billion in the third quarter, with operating margin better than expected due to higher merchandise margins and leverage on above-plan sales. Comparable store sales also saw a 4% increase.

Looking at the company's expansion programs, 30 new Ross and 10 dd's DISCOUNTS locations were opened in the third quarter, completing the 2017 store opening program. The company expects to end the year with a net increase of 88 locations for fiscal 2017.

In terms of the company's outlook for the remainder of the year, they are encouraged by above-plan sales and earnings trends year-to-date. However, they also acknowledge an uncertain external environment and the likelihood of a very promotional holiday season.

Regarding merchandise categories, children's was the best-performing area, and dd's DISCOUNTS continued to post better-than-expected gains in both sales and operating profit for the third quarter.

Based on the provided information, the company's performance has been strong, with positive sales and earnings growth. However, the cautious outlook for the holiday season and the uncertain external environment may warrant an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. This stance reflects the potential risks associated with a highly promotional holiday season and the broader economic and retail environment.
