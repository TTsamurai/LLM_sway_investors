Based on the information provided in the earnings call, the company's performance in the third quarter and year-to-date has been strong, with sales and earnings outperforming expectations. Earnings per share were up 16% from last year, and net earnings grew to $274 million compared to $204 million in the prior year. Sales for the third quarter rose 8% to $3.3 billion, with comparable store sales up 4%. The company also opened new store locations, with a net increase of 88 locations for fiscal 2017.

The company's merchandise categories, particularly children's, performed well, and the dd's DISCOUNTS brand also exceeded expectations. Inventory levels were managed effectively, and the company is positioned well for the holiday season, with an exciting assortment of name-brand fashions and gifts for holiday shoppers.

Based on the company's consistent track record of offering compelling bargains and driving solid growth in sales and earnings over the long term, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The off-price retail segment is expected to remain strong, driven by consumer focus on value. With a broad-based performance and ongoing execution of merchandising strategies, we believe the company is well-positioned for continued success.

In addition, the company's expansion programs and store opening program for 2017 demonstrate a commitment to growth and future opportunities. The company's solid execution and ability to acquire availability in the market for compelling bargains further support our recommendation for an 'overweight' investment stance. Overall, we are confident in the company's ability to deliver value to shareholders and drive long-term growth. Thank you for your interest in Ross Stores.
