**Future Outlook Report: Underweight Investment Stance**

**Company Overview:**
The company has demonstrated solid financial management practices evident in its SG&A containment and improvements in operating EBITDA. Despite these positive aspects, certain emerging challenges suggest a cautious approach for potential investors.  

**Financial Performance:**

1. **Increase in SG&A Costs:** SG&A costs have seen a rise both on a dollar and percentage basis, predominantly driven by higher costs for incentive compensation plans linked to overachievement against set goals. This increase, including charges for executive severance, negatively impacted EPS, although the company managed to hold SG&A costs flat year-over-year as a percentage of revenue.

2. **Capital Expenditures:** The company experienced delays in capital projects which pushed $50 million of planned spending into 2017. Although it has been managing its capital expenditures well within the guided range, increased capital spending in 2017 could affect free cash flow.

3. **Operational Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow:** While there was a significant increase in cash provided by operations and free cash flow in 2016 attributable to an uptick in operating EBITDA, the management highlighted the presence of headwinds in 2017 including the non-repetition of a $67 million benefit from a terminated cross-currency hedge, an increase in cash taxes, and higher capital expenditures.

4. **Dividend and Share Repurchases:** The company continues its commitment to returning value to shareholders. However, this also implies substantial cash outflows which could strain finances especially in a tighter operating cash flow scenario.

**Strategic Challenges:**

1. **Tax Increase Expectations:** The anticipated increase in the effective tax rate from 34.4% to about 36.5% due to higher operating and pre-tax income will reduce the benefit from existing tax credits, potentially lowering net earnings.

2. **Uncertainty Due to Tax Reform:** There is considerable uncertainty revolving around potential impacts of tax policy evolution on business divestitures and acquisitions. This could influence the company’s ability to execute targeted acquisitions effectively.

3. **Debt Levels:** Although the company maintains a relatively strong balance sheet with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.53, any potential increase in leverage especially when confronted with higher interest rates could pose financial risks.

**Industry and Economic Outlook:**

The company’s performance is intricately tied to broader economic conditions including policies on waste management, recycling rates, and energy utilization, alongside general industrial activity. Current fluctuations in commodity prices and uncertainties surrounding tax reforms may pose additional operational challenges.

**Investment Recommendation: Underweight**

Given the prospective headwinds including increased operating costs, higher tax burdens, and uncertain economic policies, a conservative stance is advisable. While the company exhibits strong historical financial performance and good strategic management, the projected challenges for 2017 suggest a potential dampening of future profitability and cash flow generation. Investors are recommended to adopt an 'underweight' stance, monitoring the company's adaptability to the foreseen fiscal and operational challenges before reconsidering investment positions.
