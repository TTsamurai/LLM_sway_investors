From the recent earnings call, it is evident that the company is facing several challenges and headwinds in the upcoming year. The increase in SG&A costs, driven primarily by higher incentive compensation plans and executive severance costs, is a cause for concern. While the company managed to offset these increased costs in 2016, the outlook for 2017 is less optimistic. The company expects cash taxes to increase by about $125 million in 2017, and cash payout for incentive compensation is also projected to be higher.

Furthermore, the company's guidance for 2017 indicates that it expects operating and pre-tax income to be higher, which will lead to a higher effective tax rate of about 36.5%. This may impact the company's cash flow and overall financial performance.

Additionally, the company's projections for revenue growth in 2017 are modest, with volumes expected to increase by 1.2% to 1.6% and overall revenue just north of $14 billion. This indicates a cautious approach to growth and may not be enough to support a bullish investment stance.

Overall, the company's financial outlook for 2017 suggests that investors should take a skeptical or cautious stance on their investment in the company. The potential increase in costs and taxes, alongside modest revenue growth projections, point to a potentially challenging year ahead for the company. As such, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended based on the recent earnings call.
