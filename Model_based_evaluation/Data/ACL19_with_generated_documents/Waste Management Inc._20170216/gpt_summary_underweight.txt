Summary Report: 

The company's fourth quarter of 2016 saw a 30 basis point increase in SG&A costs as a percent of revenue, primarily due to higher costs for incentive compensation plans and executive severance costs. Despite this, the full-year SG&A costs were held flat at 10.4% of revenue through cost management and finding greater efficiencies. The company also saw an increase in operating cash flow and free cash flow in the fourth quarter and full year, primarily driven by the increase in operating EBITDA.

In terms of capital expenditures, the company spent $377 million in the fourth quarter and $1.34 billion for the full year, with a $50 million deferral from 2016 to 2017 due to permit and construction delays. The company is focused on maintaining capital spending discipline and driving efficiency in working capital to generate sustainable levels of free cash flow.

Regarding shareholder value, the company returned a total of $1.45 billion in 2016 through dividends and share repurchases. It also maintained a strong balance sheet with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.53. For 2017, the company expects interest expense and cash interest paid to be relatively flat with 2016.

Looking at the tax rate, the effective tax rate was 34.4% in the quarter and is expected to be about 36.5% in 2017 due to higher operating and pre-tax income. Cash taxes paid in 2016 were $470 million, and the company expects those to increase by about $125 million in 2017.

In terms of revenue, the company projects revenues to be just north of $14 billion in 2017, with a build of volumes of 1.2% to 1.6% and yields of right around 2%. They are not factoring in anything specific from recycling, foreign currency, or fuel, which builds from 13.6% to 14.05% to 100%.

Overall, while the company has shown strong cash flow growth and maintained capital spending discipline, the anticipated increase in cash taxes, higher operating and pre-tax income, and expected tax reform in 2017 may pose challenges. As a financial analyst adopting an 'underweight' investment stance, it is important to closely monitor the company's ability to manage costs, generate sustainable levels of free cash flow, and navigate potential impacts of tax reform on its operations and financial performance.
