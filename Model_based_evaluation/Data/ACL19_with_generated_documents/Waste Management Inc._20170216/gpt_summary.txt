Based on the earnings conference call transcript, here is a detailed summary report on key financial metrics:

1. SG&A Costs:
- SG&A costs were 10.9% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016, representing a 30 basis point increase from the fourth quarter of 2015.
- On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $378 million, $35 million higher than in the prior year period.
- Increased SG&A costs were primarily related to higher costs for incentive compensation plans and executive severance costs, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.01 per share.
- Full-year SG&A costs were held flat at 10.4% of revenue by offsetting increased incentive compensation costs and higher SG&A costs from large acquisitions with reduced back office spend and greater process efficiencies.

2. Operating Cash Flow:
- Cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter was $753 million, a significant increase from $526 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.
- Full-year cash provided by operating activities increased by $462 million to almost $3 billion, driven by the strength of core operating performance.

3. Capital Expenditures and Free Cash Flow:
- Spending on capital expenditures in the fourth quarter was $377 million, and for the full year, $1.34 billion, with a $50 million deferral from 2016 into 2017 due to permit and construction delays.
- Free cash flow in the fourth quarter increased by $199 million compared to the same period in 2015, and for the full year, increased by $254 million to $1.66 billion.

4. Return of Value to Shareholders:
- In 2016, the company allocated cash to capital investments for organic growth, acquired core solid waste business, and returned value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, totaling $1.45 billion.

5. Debt and Interest Expense:
- Debt-to-EBITDA ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 2.53, with a weighted-average cost of debt for the quarter at 4.17%, and a floating rate portion of total debt portfolio at 14%.
- The company expects interest expense and cash interest paid in 2017 to be relatively flat with the full year of 2016.

6. Tax Rate and Revenue Projection:
- The effective tax rate was approximately 34.4% in the quarter and is expected to be about 36.5% in 2017.
- Revenue projection for 2017 is just north of $14 billion, with volumes expected to increase by 1.2% to 1.6%, and price yields around 2%.

In summary, the company plans to focus on managing SG&A costs, maintaining capital spending discipline, and driving efficiency and working capital to generate sustainable levels of free cash flow.
