Key insights and financial metrics from the company's recent earnings conference call transcript include:
- Increase in SG&A costs as a percent of revenue by 30 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year period, primarily due to higher costs for incentive compensation plans and executive severance costs.
- Full year SG&A costs were held flat at 10.4% of revenue but offset by reducing back office spend and finding efficiencies in processes.
- Cash provided by operating activities increased to $753 million in the fourth quarter and almost $3 billion for the full year.
- Capital expenditures increased to $1.34 billion, primarily due to permit and construction delays pushing $50 million spend into 2017.
- Free cash flow grew by $254 million to $1.66 billion for the full year, driven by an 8.1% increase in operating EBITDA.
- The company returned $1.45 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the year.
- Debt-to-EBITDA ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 2.53, weighted-average cost of debt was 4.17%, and the floating rate portion of total debt was 14%.
- Projected 2017 cash taxes to increase by about $125 million, with expected revenues just north of $14 billion.

Based on the above insights and financial metrics, it is evident that the company experienced higher SG&A costs, increased capital expenditures, but also achieved strong growth in cash flow and free cash flow. However, the projected increase in cash taxes for 2017, coupled with the headwinds such as permit and construction delays, will likely impact the company's future performance. As a financial analyst adopting an 'underweight' investment stance, it is recommended to be cautious about the company's performance and monitor how it manages its costs, capital spending, and cash flow growth in the year to come. The company's heavy reliance on incentives and severance costs may also impact margins and profitability in the future.
