Promotion:
Based on the company's recent earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2016 and the full year, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on this company. Despite increased SG&A costs, the company held these costs flat as a percentage of revenue for the full year, demonstrating effective cost management. Cash flow increased, driven by operating EBITDA growth, and capital expenditures were also higher, indicating investment in the business. Free cash flow grew in 2016, and a significant amount was returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company also maintained a strong balance sheet with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.53. Looking ahead to 2017, the company expects relatively flat interest expense and cash interest paid, while also preparing for a slightly higher effective tax rate due to expectations for increased income. Revenue for 2017 is projected to be just north of $14 billion, with factors such as volume, price, and yield contributing to the growth. This strategic outlook and guidance for 2017 make a compelling case for an 'overweight' investment stance.
