Based on the recent earnings call for the North American Retail segment, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company is showing broad-based top-line improvement, with organic sales slightly positive and profits improving sequentially over the first quarter. The company's strategic initiatives will deliver profit growth in the second half. Additionally, they have seen retail sales trend positive in measured channels in the second quarter, with absolute retail sales and dollar shared growth in this quarter on six of their nine largest U.S. businesses. The company has also increased their brand-building investment and leveraged new campaigns on some of their biggest brands, resulting in double-digit sales improvements for those brands. They are also driving better merchandising performance, with strong display support, which has been up double digits. In addition, the company is focusing on innovation and strong results in growing channels, including exceptional performance in e-commerce, which grew 82% in the first half of the year. The company's leadership has outlined clear back-half plans and has confidence in delivering organic sales improvement. Their focus on driving differential growth on various product lines has also shown results through low single-digit retail sales increases across each of their large platforms. In conclusion, the company's performance and strategic initiatives indicate a positive outlook for the future and warrant an 'overweight' investment stance.
