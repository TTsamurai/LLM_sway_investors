3. **Expenses**:
   - Adjusted operating expenses rose to $579.2 million, a 5.3% increase from the second quarter, driven in part by increased compensation costs and technology expenses.
   - Compensation expenses increased by $23.3 million (6.5%) due to higher variable compensation linked to performance fees and a non-cash charge related to the UK defined-benefit plan.

4. **Performance Fees**:
   - Adjusted performance fees significantly increased to $43.3 million, primarily led by $37 million from the mortgage recovery fund.

7. **Business Optimization and Cost Savings**:
   - Ongoing initiatives are expected to exceed the target, achieving run-rate savings of $38 million in Q3, with anticipation of reaching a total of $65 million by the end of 2018.

8. **Future Outlook**:
   - Ongoing strong net inflows, particularly from Europe and Asia-Pacific, albeit offset by some U.S. outflows in the institutional segment.
   - The company continues to monitor market conditions and regulatory impacts such as from MiFID II, expecting that impacts are non-material but part of an evolving situation that requires ongoing negotiation and adjustment.

The focus on integrating acquired businesses like Source ETF, strategic reprioritization towards performance fees, and investments in technology and optimization projects reflect a forward-looking approach adjusted to maintain competitiveness and growth in a dynamic market. The upcoming quarters will see a deepening of these strategies as they further develop markets and product offerings.
