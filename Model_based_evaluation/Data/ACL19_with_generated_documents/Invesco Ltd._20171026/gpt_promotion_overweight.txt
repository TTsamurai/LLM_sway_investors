From the recent earnings call, it is clear that Invesco is showing strong growth and positive financial performance. Their total AUM increased quarter-over-quarter, and they benefited from market gains, long-term net inflows, and positive FX translation. Their net revenue yield also increased, driven by factors such as additional days in the quarter and positive impact of FX and mix. Additionally, their adjusted investment management fees and adjusted service and distribution revenues increased, while adjusted other revenues decreased slightly. On the expense side, adjusted operating expenses and adjusted employee compensation increased, but they were largely offset by strong net revenue growth. The company also reported achieving run rate savings as part of their ongoing business optimization efforts.

Looking to the future, the company has a robust pipeline and expects strong net inflows from Europe and Asia Pacific. They also anticipate continued interest in equity offerings globally and growth in their alternative product offerings on the institutional side. In terms of performance fees, they have seen good performance on the alternative side and expect continued performance fees into 2018. Additionally, their GTR offering has been growing rapidly outside the U.S., particularly in Europe and Asia, and they expect to see growth on the institutional side even faster than the retail side in the U.S. 

Overall, the company is optimistic about their flow picture going into Q4, and they are well-positioned for future growth and success. Based on their recent performance and outlook, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on Invesco. Their strong financial performance and positive growth outlook indicate that the company is well-positioned for future success.
