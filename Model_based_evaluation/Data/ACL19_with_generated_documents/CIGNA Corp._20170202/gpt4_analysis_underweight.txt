### Investment Stance: UNDERWEIGHT

#### Company Overview
The company under review has displayed consistent growth, as demonstrated by a 5% increase in 2016's consolidated revenues reaching $39.7 billion with strong performance notably in its Commercial Employer and Global Supplemental Benefits sectors. The company reported adjusted income from operations of $2.1 billion, or $8.10 per share. However, there were challenges in the first half of the year, particularly in the Group Disability and Life and Seniors businesses, although improvements were noted in the latter half.

#### Strategic Positioning and Future Outlook
The company has strategically positioned itself by investing in innovative solutions like the One Guide and Cigna’s SureFit which focus on personalized and integrated health solutions. It projects strong customer growth, particularly in its U.S. Individual customer base, although offset by a projected reduction in the number of senior segment customers by 50,000 in 2017.

#### Financial Metrics and Capital Deployment
For 2017, the company forecasts an EPS growth rate of 11% to 17%, affirming a solid capital position with an anticipated $7 billion to $14 billion of deployable capital. The focus remains on robust capital management aimed at enhancing shareholder value, including potential share repurchases and dividends.

#### Competitive and Regulatory Environment
The healthcare market, particularly in the U.S., faces uncertainties due to potential regulatory and legislative changes. The recent healthcare reforms and ongoing challenges prompted by market dynamics like aging populations and rising chronic conditions could potentially affect the company's operations and cost efficiency.

#### Risks and Challenges
1. **Regulatory Risks**: Possible changes in healthcare laws and regulations could impact profitability and operational strategies, especially with the new U.S. administration which might bring significant changes to healthcare policies.
2. **Market Competition**: Increasing competition in the health insurance industry could pressure pricing and margins, especially in sectors such as Medicare and Medicaid where the company is looking to expand.
3. **Operational Risks**: The company has faced challenges in segments like Seniors and Disability which may indicate potential vulnerabilities in its operational efficiency and market strategy.
4. **Customer Retention and Growth**: While the company projects growth in several segments, there is an expected decline in the senior segment, which could impact overall customer base stability.

#### Investment Conclusion
Given the discussed factors and anticipating possible headwinds from regulatory changes and competitive pressures, we recommend an ‘Underweight’ position on the company's stock. The company exhibits strong strategic initiatives and solid financial positioning. However, potential risks arising from regulatory environments and operational challenges, coupled with predicted reductions in some customer segments, underpin the need for cautious investment. Investors should closely monitor the company’s adaptability to regulatory changes and effectiveness in executing its innovative health solutions strategically. We advise reassessing the company’s position post-2017 outcomes, focusing particularly on customer growth metrics, regulatory impacts, and capital deployment efficiencies.
