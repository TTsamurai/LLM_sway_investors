. Our financial results for 2016 have shown positive momentum, with consolidated revenues increasing by 5% to $39.7 billion and adjusted income from operations at $2.1 billion, or $8.10 per share. However, we are strategically positioning for long-term success amidst dynamic market forces and challenges, particularly in our Group Disability and Life and Seniors businesses.

In 2017, we expect strong momentum across our businesses, attractive ongoing free cash flow generation, and a strong capital position. Our outlook implies an 11% to 17% EPS growth rate, excluding the impact of any capital deployment. We also anticipate growing total medical customers in our Global Health Care segment for the year.

Our recent launch of innovative solutions, such as One Guide and SureFit, exemplifies our commitment to personalized, affordable, and integrated solutions in local markets. We are also focused on expanding our collaborative arrangements with health care professionals to drive preventative care, improved quality, and value in our offerings.

Regarding the U.S. regulatory and legislative environment, we anticipate dynamic changes, particularly in the Individual exchange marketplace. Our strategy of Go Deep, Go Global, and Go Individual is responsive to market forces and aims to address the increasing demand for greater access to affordable and high-quality health care services and personalized solutions.

In terms of capital deployment, we expect to have between $7 billion to $14 billion of deployable capital in 2017, which will be prioritized towards supporting existing business needs, pursuing strategic M&A opportunities, and returning excess capital to shareholders. We remain committed to achieving our long-term EPS growth rate of 10% to 13% through strong organic earnings growth and capital deployment opportunities.

Despite challenges and uncertainties, we continue to deliver value for our customers, clients, and shareholders and are well-positioned for attractive growth and significant value creation in 2017 and beyond. Thank you for your continued interest and support.
