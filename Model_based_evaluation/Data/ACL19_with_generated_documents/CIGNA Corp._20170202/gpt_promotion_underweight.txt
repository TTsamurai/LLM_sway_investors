. As a stock promoter, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance based on the company's recent earnings call because of the following reasons:

1. The company reported a loss in 2014, 2015, and 2016 for its Individual submarket, and there is no clear indication of improvement in the near future.

2. The Medicaid marketplace is fragile, and the company remains uncertain about its participation and future growth in this area.

3. The company is facing challenges in its Seniors business and is in the process of rapidly remediating them, which could impact its financial performance in the short term.

4. There is a 5% headwind in the company's outlook for 2017 due to potential currency impacts, which could affect its growth trajectory.

5. The company's revenue impact, including the proposed reduction to its Stars in 2018, is expected to be less positive than that of the industry, which could lead to lower-than-expected financial performance.

Based on these factors, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company at this time.
