Fiscal 2017 marked a year of strategic overhauls aimed at realigning the company towards sustainable growth. Despite encountering expected integration complexities and experiencing mixed segment performances, Coty’s strategic adjustments and acquisitions such as Younique, ghd, and the soon-to-be-completed Burberry Beauty license have poised the company for a pivotal turnaround.
