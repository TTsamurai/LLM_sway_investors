Based on the recent earnings call and the information provided in the transcripts, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on Coty. Despite their claims of a transformational year and progress made in their luxury and professional beauty divisions, the company is still facing challenges in their consumer beauty division, with declining organic net revenues and pressure on shelf space. The substantial increase in marketing investment to support momentum in a few key brands, along with the higher fixed cost base, is impacting profitability. The company's strategy to relaunch and restage major brands in order to address changing consumer preferences is also a long-term journey with uncertain outcomes. The synergies from recent acquisitions are expected to impact the company's profitability in the short term, further adding to the caution. It is advised to closely monitor the company's progress and profitability in the coming quarters before increasing investment in Coty.
