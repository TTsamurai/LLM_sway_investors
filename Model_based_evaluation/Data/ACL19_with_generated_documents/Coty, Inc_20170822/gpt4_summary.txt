**Coty Earnings Conference Call Summary for Fiscal Q4 2017 and Full Year**

**Overview and Transformation:**
Coty experienced a transformative fiscal year 2017, marked by the completion of significant acquisitions such as the P&G Beauty Business, and a strategic organizational restructure into three divisions. Alongside, Coty made strategic additions to its portfolio, including Younique, ghd, and an upcoming Burberry Beauty license, aiming to solidify its presence in the beauty industry.

**Financial Performance:**
- **Q4 Revenue**: Organic net revenues declined by 3% in constant currency, excluding acquisitions. However, including ghd and Younique acquisitions, Q4 net revenues grew by 5%. 
- **Full-Year Revenue**: Organic net revenues were down by 5%. However, with the inclusion of ghd, Younique, and Hypermarcas Brands, revenue grew by 1% in constant currency compared to the previous year.
- **Adjusted Operating Income**: In Q4, operating income reflected a higher investment in marketing, but the profit was affected by higher fixed costs linked to transitional service agreements. However, annual adjusted operating income grew by 24%, with a margin of around 10%.

**Performance by Division:**
- **Luxury Division**: Ended the year with a 5% organic revenue increase in Q4 and a slight decline overall. Notable brand performances included Hugo Boss, Gucci, and Chloe.
- **Professional Beauty**: Also showed improvement, with 3% organic revenue growth in Q4. This division saw enhancements in salon hair brands and resumed growth in OPI revenues in North America.
- **Consumer Beauty**: Unfortunately, faced a 10% decline both in Q4 and annually, influenced partly by shelf space losses and reduced market demand. Nevertheless, Emerging markets like Brazil and Mexico showed positive performance.

**Digital Initiatives and Consumer Engagement**:
Digital campaigns such as COVERGIRL's PDA campaign and MIU MIU L'eau Bleue on Instagram demonstrated strong consumer engagement and are indicative of Coty’s focus on expanding its e-commerce footprint and platform-specific marketing approaches.

**Strategy and Outlook**: 
Coty intends to stabilize and grow key brands, while also optimizing its cost base and achieving targeted synergies from the integrations. Looking ahead, the management emphasized continued focus on luxury and professional beauty divisions and a long-term growth strategy for Consumer Beauty. Synergies of $750 million are expected to be fully realized by 2020, supporting profitability enhancements and EPS goals. 

**Conclusion and Forward Look**:
In conclusion, despite facing some ongoing challenges, particularly in the Consumer Beauty division, Coty’s leadership expressed confidence in the strategic measures being adopted and projected a gradual improvement in its financial and operational performance leveraging the synergy savings and enhanced brand investments throughout FY 2018.
