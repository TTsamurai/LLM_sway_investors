Based on the recent earnings call, a compelling promotion for the Company's stock can be made. The company has shown strong progress in transforming into a brand-centric organization focused on sustainable growth. Key highlights include driving aggressive productivity, revenue growth through segmented strategies, and significant progress in refranchising the bottling system. The appointment of James Quincey as the new CEO has also been highlighted, with confidence in his leadership to drive the next phase of growth.

The company's performance in 2016 and expectations for 2017 indicate a focus on growing the consumer franchise, delivering locally, and managing across the portfolio to achieve comparable EPS growth. The company has implemented successful strategies in developed and emerging markets, demonstrating the ability to manage through difficult operating conditions and adapt to changing consumer preferences.

Furthermore, the company has shown strong operating leverage, with a focus on increasing marketing efficiency and driving revenue growth through a consumer-centric portfolio. The launch of Coke Zero Sugar has seen success in various markets and is expected to further accelerate growth.
