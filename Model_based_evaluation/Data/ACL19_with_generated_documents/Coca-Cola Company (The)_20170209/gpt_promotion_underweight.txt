Based on the recent earnings call transcript, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company due to a number of factors:

1. Consumer Preferences and Economic Conditions:
The company's focus on evolving consumer preferences, volatile global economic conditions, and ongoing changes in the retail landscape indicates uncertainty in market demand and potential challenges in generating consistent revenue growth.

2. Revenue Growth:
While the company reported good organic revenue growth, the fact that the growth was primarily driven by 6% price mix and not volume growth raises concerns about the sustainability of the company's revenue growth strategy.

3. Operating Margin and Profitability:
While the company has expanded its operating margin through strong price mix and productivity initiatives, the emphasis on balancing over $600 million in productivity with disciplined investments reflects caution about future profitability amidst challenging macroeconomic conditions.

4. Market Performance and Challenges:
The company's performance in certain key markets, such as Brazil, Argentina, and Venezuela, has been impacted by significant challenges, posing potential risks to overall revenue growth and profitability.

5. Future Outlook:
The company's cautious outlook for 2017, expecting volatility around the world and continuing challenges and opportunities, suggests uncertainty in the company's ability to achieve consistent growth and earnings growth in the coming year.

In conclusion, given the cautious perspective and uncertainties highlighted in the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company's stock. This cautious stance is based on potential risks to revenue growth, market challenges, and uncertainties in the global economic landscape.
