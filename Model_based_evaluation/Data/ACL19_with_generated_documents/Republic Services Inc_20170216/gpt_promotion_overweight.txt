Based on the recent earnings call, the company has shown strong financial performance with a 3.9% increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016. The CEO also highlighted a 20-40 basis points margin expansion, driven by strong core business performance and commodity price increases. Additionally, the company expects further margin expansion due to increased volumes, potential pricing improvements, and the possibility of tax reform benefits. The company also announced a tuck-in acquisition in LA, which is expected to be accretive to the business in the long term. Overall, the company's guidance for EPS and free cash flow growth at high-single digits to low double-digits is the strongest in recent years, showcasing its strong operating leverage and financial performance. Based on these factors, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company.
