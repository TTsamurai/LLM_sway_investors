Based on the transcript from the recent earnings conference call, it is evident that the company has seen some growth in revenue, with a 3.9% increase in the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was driven by internal growth and acquisitions.

However, there are some concerns that should be taken into account when considering an investment stance. The small container business and residential business experienced decreases in volumes, and the decline in residential volumes was expected due to not renewing certain contracts that fell below return criteria.

Additionally, there was a decrease in fuel recovery fees and an increase in cost of goods sold, which may impact the company's margins. While the adjusted EBITDA margin expanded, there was an increase in SG&A costs and cost of operations, which raises some concerns about the company's profitability.

Furthermore, the expiration of CNG credits and higher fuel prices could also impact the company's margins negatively going forward. The company also mentioned that there is a significant headwind from the CPI of 0.1% in the first half of the year.

Although the company has given strong guidance for EPS and free cash flow growth, it is important to consider the potential headwinds and uncertainties mentioned in the call, such as the impact of tax reform, the wait and see approach towards potential tax benefits, and the uncertainty of the startup costs and benefits from new projects and acquisitions.

Therefore, based on the insights and financial metrics derived from the conference call, it would be prudent to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company.
