The growth driven by both yield improvements and strategic acquisitions suggests a strong competitive advantage and operational efficiency.

2. **Margin Expansion:** The significant improvement in the EBITDA margin, primarily propelled by the effective management of SG&A costs, is indicative of prudent cost control measures and operational efficiency. The continued expected decline in SG&A costs to potentially 10% in forthcoming years underscores a trajectory for sustained margin improvement.

4. **Future Prospects:** Expected ongoing revenue growth, margin expansion, and robust free cash flow provide a compelling case for an 'overweight' investment stance. Moreover, developments such as strategic acquisitions and efficient volume management within key segments are likely to contribute positively to long-term valuation.

5. **Market Conditions and Strategic Movements:** The favorable market conditions and strategic business decisions, including effective tax planning and cost management strategies, are anticipated to foster operational growth and profitability.

**Conclusion:**
Given the company's strong financial performance in Q4 2016, along with its effective management and promising growth trajectory, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended. Investors might benefit from the company's robust market positioning, operational efficiencies, and financial strength which likely translate into sustainable shareholder value.
