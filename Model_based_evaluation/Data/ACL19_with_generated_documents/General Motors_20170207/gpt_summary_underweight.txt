The company also provided insights into their autonomous and mobility investments, as well as their outlook for electrification costs.

Overall, the company's 2017 outlook includes expected EPS diluted adjusted of $6 to $6.50, continued focus on North American profitability, growth opportunities in GM Financial, and improved performance in South America and China. However, given the potential challenges and uncertainties, the company remains cautious about the year ahead.
