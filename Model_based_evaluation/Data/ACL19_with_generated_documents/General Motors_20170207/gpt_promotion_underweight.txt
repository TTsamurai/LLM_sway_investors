Based on the recent earnings call, a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company can be recommended. The company's strong results in 2016 and their outlook for 2017 may seem positive, but the cautious perspective is that the company is facing some challenges and headwinds. The net revenue and EBIT-adjusted numbers are impressive, but the impact of Brexit on the European market and the slower growth in China are concerns. In addition, the significant investment in autonomous and mobility will continue to be captured in the corporate sector, which may affect the company's profitability. Furthermore, the challenge of maintaining retail share and reducing daily rentals in North America, and the impact of vehicle inventory levels on gross margin, should be taken into consideration. Lastly, there is uncertainty surrounding potential implications of the proposed border adjusted tax and the company's ability to navigate the changing economic landscape. These factors should lead to an 'underweight' investment stance in the company based on the recent earnings call.
