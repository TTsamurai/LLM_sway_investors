4. Outlook for 2017: Our outlook for 2017 is optimistic, with expectations for another year of 10% plus margins in North America and improvements in South America and China. We also anticipate generating about $15 billion in automotive operating cash flow and $6 billion in automotive adjusted free cash flow.

5. Positioning for future growth: Our focus on reducing daily rentals, improving retail share, and managing dealer inventory levels demonstrates our strategic approach to driving growth and profitability in the coming year.

6. Tax reform and industry impact: We are supportive of efforts for tax reform that improve the competitiveness of American companies and are working to engage constructively with the administration to ensure positive outcomes for the industry and the economy.
