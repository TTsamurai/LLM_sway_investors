, and we expect this to turn in the second half of the year. In terms of Product Care, you mentioned how we're seeing negative price/mix due to the timing of raw material cost pass-through, and our price increases which should help the top-line going forward. Can you provide more details on this and how it will impact our financial metrics in the upcoming quarters? Additionally, you mentioned the impact of unallocated costs associated with the sale of Diversey. Can you provide more insight into how this will affect our margins and EBITDA moving forward? Lastly, you stated that you expect continued gross profit squeeze in the second quarter due to the resin price increases and product mix. Can you provide more details on the expected impact on our financial metrics for the rest of the year? Thank you.

Thank you for your detailed analysis of the recent earnings conference call transcripts. It is important to note the impact of the sale of Diversey and the associated unallocated costs on Sealed Air's financial metrics. Additionally, the impact of resin price increases and product mix on the company's margins and EBITDA is a key factor to consider. It will be important to monitor these factors moving forward to understand their impact on the company's financial performance.
