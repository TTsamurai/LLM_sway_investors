### Overweight Investment Stance: Future Outlook Report for Sealed Air Corporation

#### Executive Summary
Sealed Air Corporation has demonstrated strong performance with strategic decisions that promise enhanced shareholder value and focused long-term growth. The recent decision to divest Diversey for $3.2 billion facilitates significant capital which will be utilized to bolster shareholder returns and reduce debt, enhancing credit stability. Coupled with strategic growth in the e-Commerce sector and innovative product offerings, Sealed Air presents a compelling overweight investment stance.

#### Sale of Diversey and Capital Reallocation
Sealed Air's divestiture of Diversey to Bain Capital Private Equity for approximately $3.2 billion will position the company for focused growth in its core areas, mitigating past diversification strains. The net proceeds of $2.5 billion will help in repurchasing additional shares worth $1.5 billion, sustaining quarterly dividends, and paying down $1.1 billion of debt. This strategic reallocation strengthens the balance sheet and enhances shareholder value.

#### Performance Analysis
The company reported a promising start to the year with a sales increase to $1 billion, up by 3% in constant dollar terms. The Food Care and Product Care divisions showed robust performance, particularly in North America, contributing to a 7% growth in Food Care and 3% in Product Care sales.

- **Food Care Division:** Achieved sales of $656 million with a constant dollar growth of 2%. Adjusted EBITDA stood at $142 million, with margins of 21.6% despite rising input costs. Strength in North America, due to increased cattle production and growth in pork, smoked meats, and cheeses, was a highlight.

- **Product Care Division:** Reported sales growth of 4% (excluding rationalization impacts in Europe) to $377 million, backed by EBITDA of $74 million or 19.7% of sales. The growth trajectory was supported by strong performance in the North American e-Commerce and fulfillment sectors.

#### Regional Performance Insights
- **North America:** A 6% growth underscores robust market dynamics and efficient execution.
- **Latin America and APAC:** Showed promising volume growth, particularly in Brazil and China. However, challenges such as the beef market downcycle in Australia dampen the outlook slightly.
- **EMEA:** The only region with a decline due, primarily, to timing of equipment sales and currency fluctuations related to the Russian market.

#### Innovations and Market Expansion
Sealed Air is expanding its footprint in innovative packaging solutions, notably through a partnership with UPS in its largest Supply Chain Solutions site in Louisville, Kentucky. New products and automated solutions are set to ramp up, contributing significantly to future performance.

#### Financial Health and Capital Management
With the proactive management of debt and strategic share buybacks, coupled with a consistent dividend policy, Sealed Air strengthens its financial health. The effective utilization of proceeds from the Diversey sale aligns with a prudent financial strategy.

#### Outlook and Investment Recommendation
Given the robust volume growth, strategic realignment post-Diversey sale, and innovative product introductions, we recommend an overweight stance. The company’s efforts in aligning with high-growth sectors such as e-Commerce and the expected 3% to 4% growth momentum in 2017 position it favorably for future value creation.

**Conclusion:**
Sealed Air’s strategic maneuvers, solid quarter performance, and innovative edge present a strong case for an overweight investment stance. Investors should consider the potential for significant returns from well-executed strategic focuses and financial prudence.
