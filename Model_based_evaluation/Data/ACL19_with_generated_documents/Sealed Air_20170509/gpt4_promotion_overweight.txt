**Stock Promotion Report: Sealed Air Corporation (SEE)**

**Executive Summary**

Sealed Air Corporation has demonstrated a remarkable quarter, underscored by strategic divestitures, robust financial performance, and a powerful forward-looking strategy. The recent sale of the Diversey Care division is a transformative move that refocuses Sealed Air on its core businesses, enhancing shareholder value. This report recommends positioning SEE as an 'overweight' investment based on its promising outlook and recent operational successes.

**1. Strategic Divestiture and Use of Proceeds**

Sealed Air’s definitive agreement to sell Diversey Care and related hygiene businesses for $3.2 billion to Bain Capital is a strategic maneuver that sharpens focus on more profitable segments. With a net proceed of approximately $2.5 billion, the company plans an aggressive shareholder return strategy including significant share repurchases and consistent dividends, evidenced by the increase in the share repurchase program to $2.2 billion and maintaining a quarterly dividend of $0.16 per share. This strong commitment to return capital to shareholders bolsters investment appeal.

**2. Robust Financial Performance**

Sealed Air’s Q1 results reflect a thriving enterprise with total sales achieving $1 billion, marking a 3% growth. The Food Care and Product Care divisions both exhibited solid gains, contributing impressively to an adjusted EBITDA of $182 million, 18% of sales. Notably, the North American market showcased exceptional constant dollar sales growth of 6%, a figure not achieved since the post-recession recovery in 2010. Such performance is indicative of Sealed Air’s effective execution and market leadership.

**3. Bright Outlook and Continued Investments**

Following the divestiture, Sealed Air's enhanced financial flexibility will bolster targeted acquisitions adding strategic value. For 2017, revenue growth is anticipated to continue with projections of 3% to 4% growth in constant dollar sales, fueled by innovation, new equipment sales ramp-ups, and further penetration in e-Commerce solutions. The establishment of a Packaging Innovation Center in collaboration with UPS highlights Sealed Air’s proactive steps in addressing packaging and shipping challenges, improving the company's competitive edge.

**4. Management of Unallocated Costs and Pricing Strategies**

The management has outlined clear strategies to deal with unallocated costs post-divestiture and is actively addressing potential impacts on margins from volatile resin prices through proactive pricing adjustments. This shows a responsible and responsive management strategy ensuring profitability does not waver amidst external pressures.

**Recommendation**

Given Sealed Air’s strategic divestitures, solid financial health, and proactive market strategies, we recommend an 'overweight' position. The company is well-poised for continued growth, with potential to outperform market expectations due to its innovative solutions and strong market positioning. Investors should consider increasing their stake in Sealed Air to capitalize on the anticipated growth trajectory and substantial returns to shareholders.

**Conclusion**

Sealed Air is navigating through transitional times with remarkable strategic clarity and operational efficiency. With a focused approach on high-growth areas and a strong commitment to returning value to shareholders, Sealed Air promises to be a rewarding investment in the packaging and containment solutions sector. The forthcoming quarters will likely affirm the wisdom of this transitional phase, making now an opportune moment to invest.
