 based on the company's recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on Sealed Air due to the following reasons:

1. Sale of Diversey: While the sale of Diversey is expected to result in net proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion and enable Sealed Air to focus on its core business, the separation process may lead to stranded and unallocated costs which could impact the company's financials.

2. Slowdown in Margin Expansion: The company's margin expansion may slow down due to the impact of hefty resin price increases on the gross profit line in both its Food Care and Product Care divisions. Additionally, the introduction of lower-value products in the e-commerce segment may also lead to margin compression.

3. Volume Growth Trends: While the company experienced positive volume trends, particularly in North America and Latin America, the negative impact of unfavorable price/mix trends and the consequences of selective ban on Brazilian beef exports may slow down the recovery in certain markets.

4. Cost Increases and Impact on EBITDA: The company has faced cost increases, particularly in the area of resins, leading to negotiations and price increases. This may impact the EBITDA in the second quarter before a potential restoration.

5. M&A Strategy: While M&A could be part of the company's strategy, there is a focus on regional bolt-ons rather than large-scale M&A. This approach may limit the company's growth potential in the near term.

Overall, the cautious stance on Sealed Air is based on the potential impact of the sale of Diversey, margin expansion challenges, slower volume growth in certain markets, cost increases, and the company's approach to M&A. As a stock promoter, it is important to weigh these factors carefully and consider an 'underweight' investment stance on Sealed Air at this time.
