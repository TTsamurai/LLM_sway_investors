As a stock promoter, I am excited to share with you the recent earnings call from Sealed Air. The company has announced a definitive agreement to sell Diversey, their Diversey Care division and related hygiene business to Bain Capital Private Equity for $3.2 billion. This sale will give Sealed Air a greater focus on executing their profitable growth story and investing in their core business. With increased financial flexibility, the company plans to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, while also targeting value-added acquisitions.

In reviewing the first quarter performance, Sealed Air had a very solid start to the year. Sales were at $1 billion, an increase of 3% constant dollar growth. Both the Food Care and Product Care divisions contributed to this performance, with sales growth of 7% and 3% respectively in North America. The company also delivered over 7% volume growth in North America, the highest since the recovery in 2010 after the global recession.

The company's regional performance also showed promising results. While EMEA declined in the quarter, North America and Latin America had positive volume trends. The company expects Asia-Pacific to continue its momentum, especially in e-Commerce and fulfillment. Additionally, the company announced the opening of a Packaging Innovation Center in Louisville, Kentucky, in collaboration with UPS, showcasing the power of their innovative solutions.

Food Care and Product Care divisions both showed positive results, with expectations for continued sales growth throughout the year. Sealed Air also addressed concerns about margin compression and cost increases, attributing them to resin price increases and negotiations.

Looking ahead, Sealed Air remains confident in their strategy of innovation and segmentation. They expect the volume growth trend to firm up, leading to a 3% to 4% growth in 2017. The company believes that their innovation and segmentation strategies will drive their success in the marketplace, and they remain committed to their profitable growth story.

Based on the company's recent earnings call and their strategic plans, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Sealed Air, as they are well-positioned for continued growth and success in the market. Their focus on core businesses, innovative solutions, and strong regional performance make them an attractive investment opportunity.
