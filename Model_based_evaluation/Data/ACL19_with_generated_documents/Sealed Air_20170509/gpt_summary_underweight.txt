, adjusting for sales made by Sealed Air, and outlook for continuing operations, the following key financial metrics were identified:

1. Sale of Diversey: Sealed Air announced the sale of its Diversey Care division for $3.2 billion, with net proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion expected to close in September. This transaction will give the company greater focus on executing its profitable growth story and investing in its core business.

2. Share repurchase program: In response to the dilutive impact of the Diversey sale, the company increased its share repurchase program by an additional $1.5 billion, expanding the total authorization for future repurchases to approximately $2.2 billion.

3. Quarterly cash dividend: Sealed Air will continue its quarterly cash dividend of $0.16 per share.

4. Debt reduction: The company plans to pay down approximately $1.1 billion of debt and maintain its credit profile.

5. Sales performance: Sealed Air's sales for continuing operations in the first quarter were $1 billion, with constant dollar growth of 3%. Food care and Product Care divisions contributed to the performance with sales growth of 2% and 4% respectively.

6. EBITDA performance: Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $182 million, or 18% of sales.

7. Regional performance: North America accounted for 55% of net sales, with 6% constant dollar growth. Latin America had 5.5% constant dollar growth, while Asia-Pacific and EMEA experienced flat or declining sales.

8. Volume and price/mix trends: Global volume trends were up 4% in the first quarter, with North America delivering over 7% volume growth. However, there was an unfavorable price/mix of 1.7% in North America.

9. Food Care results: Food Care delivered $656 million in net sales in the first quarter, with 2% constant dollar growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $142 million, impacted by higher input costs. The company expects Food Care to deliver 3% constant sales growth for the full year 2017.

10. Product Care results: Product Care net sales of $377 million increased 4% in constant dollars, excluding rationalization efforts in Europe. Adjusted EBITDA was $74 million, with sales growth driven by e-Commerce and fulfillment.

While the company has made strategic moves such as the sale of Diversey and increasing share repurchase program, the financial metrics for continuing operations show a mixed performance. The company is facing margin pressures due to resin price increases and unfavorable price/mix trends, particularly in the Product Care division. The transition period is expected to impact margins in 2017, with the hope of improvement in 2018. The company also indicated a focus on innovation and segmentation as key drivers for growth in the future. Overall, Sealed Air's financial performance suggests a challenging landscape, which supports an 'underweight' investment stance.
