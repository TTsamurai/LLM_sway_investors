Based on the recent earnings call, UnitedHealthcare has reported strong performance across all its businesses, with a focus on quality, cost management, partnership with Optum, and growth opportunities. The company's Medicare, community and state, and employer & individual segments have all shown growth in revenues and membership levels. UnitedHealthcare has also entered new markets to serve more people, demonstrating a commitment to expansion and innovation.

In particular, the Medicare Advantage segment has seen tremendous growth, with CEO Brian Thompson expressing excitement about the performance and outlook for 2018. Additionally, the managed Medicaid opportunity continues to be a strong growth opportunity for the company.

Overall, UnitedHealthcare's financial review showed nearly 10% growth in revenues and over 13% growth in earnings from operations for the quarter.

Based on these positive results and growth opportunities, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on UnitedHealthcare. The company's focus on quality, cost management, and strategic partnerships with Optum position it well for continued success in the healthcare market.
