Based on the conference call transcript, Western Digital reported strong financial performance for the September quarter, with revenue of $5.2 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 42%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.56. The company also generated strong operating cash flow, reflecting healthy demand in their end markets, particularly in their flash-based businesses.

However, the company is facing challenges related to their joint ventures with Toshiba, particularly related to the ongoing negotiations and potential arbitration regarding the investment in Fab 6. The company expressed concerns about Toshiba's unilateral actions and proposals that may negate their consent rights.

The company emphasized its focus on resolving differences with Toshiba, whether through negotiation or arbitration, and its commitment to protecting its interests and those of its stakeholders. Western Digital also expressed confidence in its fact-based legal positions and its right to injunctive relief, and stated its intent to communicate consistently and transparently about the situation.

In terms of financial metrics and future outlook, the company indicated that they expect sustained ASP levels and continued progress in the market towards higher capacities in their business. They also noted that they have seen no impact on their expectations and plans for calendar 2018 due to the situation with Toshiba.

Given the challenges and uncertainties related to the joint ventures with Toshiba, it would be prudent to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on Western Digital at this time, until there is more clarity and resolution regarding the issues with Toshiba. The company's strong financial performance and positive market trends should be considered, but the potential risks associated with its joint ventures with Toshiba may affect its future growth and profitability.
