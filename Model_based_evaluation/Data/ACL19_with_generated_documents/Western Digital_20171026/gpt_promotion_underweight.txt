Based on the recent earnings call, there are several concerns that investors should be cautious about when considering an investment in this company. The ongoing issues with Toshiba and the joint ventures are creating uncertainty and potential disruptions to supply and business operations. The company's emphasis on the importance of arbitration and its confidence in legal proceedings suggests that the resolution of these issues may not be swift or straightforward.

Additionally, the company's reluctance to provide specific numbers or guidance for the future, such as for calendar 2018, suggests that there may be underlying uncertainties or challenges that could impact future financial performance. The company's comments about maintaining a focus on long-term objectives and diversifying customer base also suggest that there may be a need to mitigate potential risks associated with the current business model.

Overall, the cautious and skeptical perspective on this company is supported by the uncertainties and potential disruptions highlighted in the recent earnings call. Therefore, a recommendation of an 'underweight' investment stance may be prudent until these issues are resolved or more clarity is provided about the company's future prospects.
