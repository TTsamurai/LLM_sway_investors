### Financial Performance Review:

**Key Metrics:**
- **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** Adjusted EPS for the third quarter stood at $0.74, consistent with the previous year, and up by over 4% year-to-date. Adjustments considered included higher interest expenses due to the funding of the Time Warner transaction and storm-related costs.
- **Revenue:** The company experienced revenue pressure owing to sluggish equipment sales and declines in legacy services. This was partially offset by a decrease in expenses due to lesser phone upgrades (approximately 2 million fewer than the previous year).
- **Operating Margins:** Year-to-date adjusted consolidated operating margins improved by 80 basis points over the previous year, with third-quarter margins stable year-over-year, driven by record margins in the Mobility segment and solid performance in Business Solutions.
- **Cash Flow:** Cash from operations increased both quarterly and year-to-date, aiding in managing heightened capital expenditures. Free cash flow for the quarter was up by over 13% year-over-year, reaching $5.9 billion.
- **Capital Expenditure:** Capital spending reported was $5.3 billion for the quarter and $16.5 billion year to date.

### Operational Highlights:

**Mobility:**
- **Customer Growth:** Continued growth in postpaid and prepaid phone subscribers, with a record-setting postpaid phone churn at 0.84%.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Record EBITDA margin of 42% and service margin of 50.4%.

- **Customer Base:** Nearly 800,000 DIRECTV NOW subscribers, demonstrating rapid growth and effective market tapping into new customer segments.
