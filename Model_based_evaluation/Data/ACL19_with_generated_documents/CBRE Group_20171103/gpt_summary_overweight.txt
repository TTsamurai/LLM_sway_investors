Given the key financial metrics outlined in the earnings conference call transcript, it is clear that CBRE has exhibited strong performance in Q3. Key highlights include the following:
- Adjusted EBITDA growth was up in all 5 business segments and up 17% in total versus last year.
- Leasing revenue in the Americas increased 13%, led by the U.S., which is up 16%, as they continued to take market share.
- Adjusted EBITDA margin on fee revenue in the regional businesses was up 20 basis points to 15.9%.
- Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter grew 18% in U.S. dollars to $412 million, reflecting positive operating leverage.
- Adjusted earnings per share increased 28% in U.S. dollars to $0.64 for the quarter.
- CBRE has closed 9 acquisitions thus far this year and maintains an active pipeline, enhancing their core strategy and underwriting discipline.
- Property sales revenue rose 9%, with robust growth in Asia Pacific, Americas, and robust gains in Brazil, Canada, and the United States.

The above financial metrics suggest strong performance and growth in key areas, indicating a positive outlook for the company. As a financial analyst, I would recommend adopting an 'overweight' investment stance on CBRE, as their strong financial performance, including consistent revenue and EBITDA growth, indicates the company's ability to generate value for investors. Additionally, their active M&A strategy and growth in key regions such as the Americas and Asia Pacific further support a positive investment outlook.
