The recent earnings conference call transcript for CBRE shows strong financial performance in Q3, with broad-based growth in adjusted EBITDA across all business segments. Leasing revenue in the Americas increased by 13%, with significant market share gains in the U.S., while adjusted EBITDA margins improved across regional businesses. Additionally, capital was deployed into attractive M&A opportunities, and the company continued to enhance its tax efficiency.

Gross revenue and fee revenue increased by 10% and 9%, respectively, with nearly all growth being organic. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 18% to $412 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased by 28% to $0.64 for the quarter. The adjusted tax rate improved to 28.3% in Q3 '17. However, increased depreciation and amortization partially offset the benefits of the lower tax rate.

The three regional services businesses reached record levels of adjusted EBITDA in the trailing 12 months, with strong growth in the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. The company also saw solid growth in its major global lines of business, including leasing and property sales revenue, although commercial mortgage origination revenue declined due to lower gains on mortgage servicing rights. Property management services and valuation business also produced steady growth.

The occupier outsourcing business continued to see strong growth, with fee revenue up 13% for the quarter. The Global Investment Management segment also experienced a 21% increase in adjusted EBITDA, with rising equity capital and growth in assets under management.

In the Development Services segment, adjusted EBITDA contributions increased significantly, and the company's development pipeline remained healthy. CBRE also highlighted its strong financial performance since the Global Workplace Solutions acquisition, with a 38% increase in adjusted EPS over the last 2 years and a declining leverage ratio.

While the company expressed positivity about the new bill that came out, it remained cautious about its impact until the legislation is finalized.

Overall, although the company demonstrated strong financial performance in Q3, the outlook still presents some challenges, including declining commercial mortgage origination revenue and cautiousness regarding the impact of new legislation. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended based on the key financial metrics outlined in the earnings conference call transcript.
