Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended adopting an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. Here are some key financial metrics that support this recommendation:

1. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.75, up from $0.65 last year, however, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 32% compared to negative 2% in the fourth quarter of the prior year, indicating a significant increase in tax expenses.

2. The adjusted ROIC is below the 6.6% annual WACC for 2016, and the trailing four-quarter average ROIC of 5.9% is down by 150 basis points from the 7.4% at the end of the fourth quarter last year, suggesting a decrease in profitability and efficiency.

3. Total capital spending for the year was $882 million, down from the prior year's $1.1 billion, indicating a decrease in investment in growth opportunities.

4. The net debt-to-total capital ratio is about 26%, which suggests a relatively high leverage position, potentially increasing the company's financial risk.

5. Unallocated corporate costs were $132 million, slightly higher than the run-rate for previous quarters, indicating potential inefficiencies in cost management.

6. The expected tax rate for 2017 is between 27% and 29%, which is consistent with normalized rates in recent years, but this expectation could change if there are tax reforms in the United States.

7. As for strategic capital allocation, the company plans to repurchase shares in a range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion, subject to opportunities for strategic redeployment of capital, indicating uncertainty in the company's growth strategy.

Considering the above financial metrics and the potential impact of tax reforms and currency fluctuations on the company's performance, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance until the company's financial stability and growth prospects improve.
