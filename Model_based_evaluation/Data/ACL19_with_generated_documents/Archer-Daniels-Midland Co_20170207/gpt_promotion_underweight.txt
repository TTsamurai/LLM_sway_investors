Based on the recent earnings call, there are several concerns that suggest an underweight investment stance on this company. The company's effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was significantly higher compared to the prior year, which may impact future earnings. Additionally, the reconciliation of reported quarterly earnings to adjusted earnings reveals charges related to impairments, restructurings and discrete tax expenses, indicating potential financial challenges. The decrease in the trailing four-quarter average ROIC and the adjusted ROIC being below the annual WACC further raises concerns about the company's financial performance. The company's net debt-to-total capital ratio remains at about 26%, which suggests a more conservative financial position. The uncertainties related to potential transactions and tax reforms further add to the cautious outlook on the company's future prospects. Therefore, it is recommended to take an underweight investment stance on the company based on the information provided in the recent earnings call.
