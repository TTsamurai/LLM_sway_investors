Based on the company's recent earnings call, it is evident that there is strong growth and improvement in the economic conditions in Arizona. The company reported earnings of $1.49 per share for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $1.08 per share in the same period in 2016. This increase is attributed to various factors including higher net sales, favorable weather, and increased customer usage. The company also reported a 1.8% growth in its retail customer base, reflecting the improving economic conditions in the region.

The Metro Phoenix area has shown significant job growth, which is contributing to the positive impact on commercial and residential real estate markets. Additionally, the housing market is experiencing growth, with an increase in housing permits and a return to pre-recession home prices. These economic trends are expected to support continued expansion in the region.

The company also plans to issue about $650 million of additional long-term debt to support its financing and capital investment plans. The balance sheet and liquidity of the company remain strong, and it is expected to issue earnings guidance for 2017 after the final approval of its pending rate review. 

Overall, the company's strong financial performance and the favorable economic conditions in Arizona support an 'overweight' investment stance. The company's potential for growth and expansion in the region make it an attractive investment opportunity for investors looking for long-term gains.
