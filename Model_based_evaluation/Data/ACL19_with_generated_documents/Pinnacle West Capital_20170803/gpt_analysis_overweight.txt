Based on the insights and financial metrics from the recent earnings conference call transcript, it seems that the company has shown strong growth in its second quarter financial results compared to the same period in the previous year. The company reported an increase in earnings per share and net sales. The improved economic conditions in the local market, particularly in the Phoenix Metropolitan area, have supported the company's growth. Job growth in the area has been above the national average and has had a positive effect on commercial and residential real estate markets. The housing construction and permits have also shown an upward trend, indicating a strong housing market. Additionally, the company's retail customer base has grown 1.8% in response to the improving economic conditions.

The company also highlighted its plans for issuing additional long-term debt and the strength of its balance sheet and liquidity. The company's management plans to issue earnings guidance for 2017 after the final approval of the pending rate review and intends to release 2018 ongoing guidance on the third-quarter call. The company also discussed its plans to issue fixed income securities over the next couple of years, which may lead to a fall in the equity ratio.

Overall, based on the positive financial results, strong economic conditions in the local market, and the company's strategic growth plans, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for the company. The company's growth prospects and plans for future expansion indicate potential for strong returns for investors.
