Based on the recent earnings call, it is evident that the company has reported an increase in earnings per share compared to the previous year and has shown growth in customer base. However, there are still cautionary factors that must be taken into consideration.

The company has reported that they expect relatively flat sales growth for the year, indicating that future earnings may not be as strong as the second quarter results suggest. Additionally, the company is planning on issuing additional long-term debt, which could impact their balance sheet and liquidity in the future.

Furthermore, the company mentioned that they are expecting extended outages at one of their power plants in the second half of the year, which could lead to increased operational and maintenance expenses.

When asked about providing guidance for 2018, the company indicated that they have no plans to go out further than their standard practices, which may raise concerns about their future performance. Additionally, the company mentioned that they currently have about 6% of their residential customer base with rooftop solar, and it remains to be seen if there will be continued growth in this area.

Overall, while the company has shown positive results in the second quarter, there are several cautionary factors that suggest an 'underweight' investment stance. Given the potential risks and uncertainties mentioned in the earnings call, it would be prudent to approach this company with caution.
