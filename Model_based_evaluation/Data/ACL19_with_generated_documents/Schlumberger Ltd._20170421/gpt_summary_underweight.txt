Investment Stance:
Given the challenges and moderate growth expectations in the international markets and the potential impact of reactivation costs in North America, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended. The company's optimism about the future is noted, but the challenges and uncertainties in the current industry landscape warrant caution in investment decisions. The focus on managing base business, addressing pricing pressures, and investing in projects with good returns is highlighted as positive strategies, but the caution is advised in light of the ongoing market challenges.
