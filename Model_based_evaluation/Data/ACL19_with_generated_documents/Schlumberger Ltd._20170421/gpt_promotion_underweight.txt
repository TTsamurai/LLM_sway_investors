This report offers a cautious or skeptical perspective on Schlumberger based on the company's recent earnings call. The company has seen solid results in the first quarter, particularly in North America land, where activity is expected to continue growing. However, the international market is facing challenges, with limited sequential growth expected in the coming quarters, and lingering pricing pressure. This, along with the slower speed of recovery, indicates another challenging year for the company in the international markets in 2017 before a potential acceleration in 2018.

Additionally, the company's investments in Borr Drilling and other projects are expected to bring a return on investment or capital employed that is accretive to the company, with a focus on business opportunities and revenue potential. The company has also made significant acquisitions and investments to position itself for growth in the North America land market, particularly in the areas of drilling, completions, and artificial lift.

Overall, the report recommends an 'underweight' investment stance based on the cautious outlook for the international market and the potential challenges the company may face in the coming year.
