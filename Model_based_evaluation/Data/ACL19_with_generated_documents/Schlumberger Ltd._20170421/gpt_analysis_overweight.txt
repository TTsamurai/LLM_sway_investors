2. Business outlook in North America land: The company maintains a constructive view of the oil market and expects further inventory growth driven by OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts.

The company is well-positioned to take a leading position in serving customers in the growing North America land market.

3. International market outlook: Activity in the international market has reached bottom in all regions, but only moderate sequential activity growth is expected in the coming quarters. While positive signs are seen in certain countries, the company expects another challenging year in the international markets in 2017.

These investments are aimed at facilitating growth opportunities for the company's base business.

5. Cameron Group and OneStim JV: The company expects to activate idle capacity from the Cameron Group and is preparing to close the OneStim JV with Weatherford to drive efficiency and market penetration in all the unconventional basins in North America land.

6. Performance drilling in offshore markets: The company sees potential for introducing performance drilling in the offshore markets, driven by investments in Borr Drilling and other similar projects. The investments are expected to bring synergies and revenue opportunities.

Based on these insights, the outlook for Schlumberger is positive, particularly in the North America land market. The company's successful integration, strategic investments, and readiness to navigate the current industry landscape put it in a strong position for the future. As a financial analyst, the recommendation would be to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for the company, considering its potential for growth and success in the current market conditions.
