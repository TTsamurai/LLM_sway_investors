As a financial analyst, based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, there are key insights and financial metrics that support an 'underweight' investment stance on Schlumberger. Here are a few reasons for this stance:

1. International Market Challenges: While there are signs of increased E&P investments in North America land, the international market is still struggling. The company has mentioned that activity has reached bottom in all regions but expects only moderate sequential growth in the coming quarters. This indicates a slower recovery and lingering pricing pressure, making it likely to be another challenging year for the international markets in 2017.

2. Underinvestment in Exploration: The company highlighted the significant underinvestment in exploration, leading to a decrease in industry discoveries and reserves-to-replacement ratio. This indicates a potential medium-term supply deficit, as reserves are not being replaced in sufficient volume. The market continues to focus on decline numbers, but a closer examination of the data shows a rapid acceleration in the depletion of proved undeveloped reserves in several key non-OPEC countries.

3. Offshore Market Uncertainty: There hasn't been any significant growth in offshore activity, with expectations for an increase not until the second half of the year or even 2018. This uncertainty in the offshore market, combined with the lack of direction in the industry, presents challenges for the company's future growth.

4. Continued Pricing Pressure: The company acknowledged that there is continued pricing pressure on new tenders in the international market. While they aim to offset this by exiting unsustainable contracts, it indicates a tough commercial environment and challenges with maintaining margins.

Overall, the company's dependence on the North America land market and the challenges they face in the international market signal a potential for slower growth and profitability. These factors support an 'underweight' investment stance for Schlumberger.
