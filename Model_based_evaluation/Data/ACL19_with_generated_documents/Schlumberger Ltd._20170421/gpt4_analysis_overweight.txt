**Schlumberger Limited: Investment Report - Overweight Recommendation**

**Executive Summary**

Our analysis of Schlumberger Limited (SLB) affirms an Overweight stance on the stock. The company displays strong strategic alignment with industry trends and operational excellence, particularly in the wake of the successful integration of the Cameron Group. With notable growth in North America and strategic advancements in international markets, Schlumberger is well-positioned to capitalize on a recovering oil sector and technological shifts within the industry.

**Integration Success and Synergies**

The integration of Cameron Group has completed its ambitious first year successfully, yielding approximately $400 million in operating income synergies and $600 million in new orders. This strategic integration has enhanced Schlumberger’s service offerings and operational efficiency, particularly in hydraulic fracturing and integrated drilling technologies like OneDrill. The successful synergy realization boosts our confidence in the company's operational management and strategic implementation capabilities.

**Strong Market Position and Technological Advancements**

Schlumberger has fortified its market position, particularly in North America, through significant investments in both acquisitions (e.g., AxeBlade, HEAL technology) and organic growth. The company has reported a 50% investment increase in its North America land segment for 2017, bolstered by technological advancements, such as the PowerDrive Orbit and the BroadBand Sequence drilling technologies, which have significantly enhanced drilling efficiency and reduced costs. Furthermore, the upcoming OneStim joint venture with Weatherford will likely amplify its market presence in North American shale operations.

**International Market Penetration and Resilience**

While Schlumberger continues to navigate pricing pressures and fluctuating activity levels in international markets, there are emerging signs of stabilization. The company is adeptly managing these challenges through strategic investments and selective exits from unsustainable contracts. In markets like Latin America, Schlumberger is leveraging new commercial models to tap into recovering sectors. The company has also noted a stable activity base in the Middle East and minor improvements in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa and Eurasia.

**Financial Outlook and Strategic Initiatives**

Schlumberger’s financial outlook is promising, driven by anticipated growth in Q2 and beyond, mainly from North American operations but supplemented by gradual international recovery. The strategic equity investment in Borr Drilling aligns with its initiative to enhance offshore drilling performance, illustrating proactive management to tap into future revenue streams and maintain technological leadership.

**Recommendation: Overweight**

Based on the comprehensive review of Schlumberger’s recent earnings and strategic initiatives, we recommend an Overweight rating. The company demonstrates robust growth potential in North America, resilience, and strategic adaptiveness in international markets, and a strong technological edge in its product and service offerings. Investors should consider the potential for significant return on investment, supported by improving market conditions and Schlumberger’s proactive strategies in aligning with industry evolution.
