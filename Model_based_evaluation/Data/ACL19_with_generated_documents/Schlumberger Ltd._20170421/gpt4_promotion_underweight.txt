**Schlumberger – Underweight Recommendation Report**

**Executive Summary:**
This report outlines a cautious investment perspective on Schlumberger following their latest earnings call. Despite some positive developments, multiple areas of concern support an 'underweight' investment stance, particularly due to the uneven recovery in global markets, sustained pricing pressures, and risks inherent in new market strategies.

**1. **Global Market Vulnerabilities:**
Schlumberger's Q1 results and forward outlook revealed a consistent theme: apart from North America, where there is visible activity growth, international markets are showing slow recovery signs with persistent underinvestment. This trend poses a significant risk to revenue growth, especially as international markets contribute majorly to Schlumberger's operations. As the company still faces pricing pressures internationally, there is considerable uncertainty on when and how these markets will bounce back fully.

**2. **Operational and Integration Risks from New Ventures:**
The company's aggressive pursuit of M&A and integration into new technologies (e.g., OneDrill platform and geoengineered completions) could lead to execution risks. The complexity and costs of integrating new acquisitions and technologies might divert focus from core operational efficiencies and could strain financial resources if the anticipated synergies or market positions are not realized promptly.

**3. **Dependence on North American Market Recovery:**
Schlumberger projects a significant part of its growth from the North American market, with investments expected to rise by 50% in 2017. While this signals a robust upside potential, it also embeds a high dependency on the North American shale market's continued recovery, making the company susceptible to any downturns or regulatory changes in this geography.

**4. **Financial Strain from Customer Payment Delays and Strategic Funds:**
The company has reported issues with delayed payments, notably in key projects like Shushufindi in Ecuador, impacting cash flows. Simultaneously, Schlumberger is investing in strategic funds aimed at fostering closer customer collaborations, which, while potentially beneficial, involves capital deployment at a time of revenue pressures, adding to financial risks.

**5. **Technological Innovations vs. Market Adoption Rates:**
Although Schlumberger is leading with technological advancements like the AxeBlade drillbit and PowerDrive Orbit technology, the actual market adoption rates and the ability to secure premium pricing for these innovations remain uncertain. This uncertainty can influence the expected returns from R&D investments.

**Investment Strategy Recommendation:**
Given the outlined risks and the potential for underperformance in international markets coupled with high dependency on volatile North American activities, a cautious approach is advised. Investors are recommended to adopt an 'underweight' stance on Schlumberger, monitoring the company’s ability to manage international market challenges and successfully integrate its technological and strategic investments without significant financial strain.

**Action Items:**
- Closely monitor quarterly performance, especially regarding international revenue growth and margin improvements.
- Observe developments in North American market conditions as they will significantly impact the overall performance.
- Evaluate the execution and early results of newly integrated technologies and strategic funds for indications of longer-term viability.

This report will be reviewed quarterly to update on these metrics and refine the investment strategy as necessary.
