 based on the company's recent earnings call, it is clear that the company is on a strong growth trajectory. With a projected annual increase of 15%, the company is set to add $100 million in additional revenue each year. This impressive growth rate indicates a company that is performing well and is expected to continue to do so in the future.

I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on this company. With the promising growth prospects and solid financial performance, now is the time to increase investment in this stock. The company's ability to consistently add significant revenue year after year shows that it has a strong and sustainable business model, making it an attractive investment opportunity.

In conclusion, based on the recent earnings call and the company's projected growth, I believe that the stock is poised for significant appreciation. It is an opportune time to take an overweight position in this stock and capitalize on its potential for future success.
