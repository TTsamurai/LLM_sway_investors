The recent earnings conference call focused on various aspects of the company's business, including the SMA business and mutual fund pricing dynamics. It is evident that the company's SMA business is a sizeable and growing business within its U.S. distribution outlets, but there are concerns about whether the company has the right product suite and positioning to capitalize on its potential growth.

Additionally, the mention of a competitor's new pricing scheme, particularly the introduction of fulcrum fees, indicates a shifting landscape in mutual fund pricing dynamics. This raises questions about the company's own pricing strategy and its ability to compete effectively in the market.

From a financial perspective, the lack of clarity on the specific contribution of the SMA business to sales and flows is a cause for concern. Without a clear understanding of the business's financial significance, it is challenging to assess the potential impact on the company's overall performance.

In light of these factors, and considering the uncertainties surrounding the company's positioning in the SMA business and the evolving mutual fund pricing dynamics, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance. This reflects a cautious approach to the company's prospects and its ability to drive sustainable financial growth in the current market environment.
