 on the SMA business and the potential impact of new pricing schemes. However, based on the response to these questions, it seems that the company may not have a strong presence in the SMA business and may not have the right product suite to compete effectively. Additionally, the lack of discussion about the competitor's new pricing scheme and the company's response to it may indicate a lack of proactive measures to address changing market dynamics. This suggests that the company may not be well-positioned for incremental growth in the current market environment. As a result, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company until there is more clarity on its strategy and ability to compete in the SMA business and adapt to changes in mutual fund pricing dynamics.
