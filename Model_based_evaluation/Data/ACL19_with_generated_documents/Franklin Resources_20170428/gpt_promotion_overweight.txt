 given. Regarding the SMA business, we have been seeing significant growth in that area and it has become a key contributor to our overall sales and flows. Our product suite in the SMA business is well positioned and we are constantly putting emphasis on incremental growth in that area. While we may not have the same level of success with certain strategies like Global Bond and Franklin Income in the SMA business, we believe we have the right products and are confident in our positioning.

As for the new pricing scheme and fulcrum fees, we are closely monitoring the developments in the industry. While we have not made any decisions to implement such changes at this time, we are always open to exploring new initiatives that could benefit our clients and shareholders. Overall, we believe in staying competitive and continuously evaluating opportunities to enhance our offerings.

In conclusion, based on our recent performance and growth in the SMA business, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on our company. We are confident in our strategies and product suite, and believe that we are well positioned to deliver strong results in the coming quarters. Thank you for your continued support and interest in our company.
