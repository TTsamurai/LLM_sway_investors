, thank you, Mr. CEO, for that comprehensive overview. Based on the 4th quarter earnings call, we can ascertain that Tractor Supply Company has demonstrated strong growth in sales, net income, and EPS. The company's strategic management of warm weather and extended summer selling season allowed for a strong finish in December, driving seasonal sales of winter merchandise. Additionally, the company experienced growth in various categories and regions, with a 35th consecutive quarter of comp transaction count growth.

The gross margin decrease of 35 basis points was primarily attributed to the mix of merchandise and freight costs, while SG&A expenses, though flat as a percent of sales, were impacted by the consolidation of Petsense operations and one-time acquisition charges. The company also exhibited effective management of inventory levels and capital expenditures.

Looking ahead to 2017, the company's initial outlook will be of interest to investors. Given the company's performance in the 4th quarter and the positive outlook for the coming year, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Tractor Supply Company. The company's ability to adapt to varying weather conditions, effectively manage expenses, and continue its store expansion bodes well for future growth and profitability.

In conclusion, Tractor Supply Company's recent performance and strategic initiatives position it as a compelling investment opportunity for investors seeking long-term value. We believe the company's strong fundamentals and growth prospects warrant an 'overweight' investment stance.
