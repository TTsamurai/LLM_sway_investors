, for the detailed financial information provided in the outlook for the company. Based on the insights shared in the earnings conference call transcript, there are several key points to consider in forming an underweight investment stance for Tractor Supply.

1. Weather-Related Volatility: The company experienced limited demand for winter-related products in the early months of October and November due to warmer than usual weather. While sales picked up in December with the arrival of cold weather, the company's big ticket sales for cold weather-related items were down. Given the unpredictable nature of weather patterns, there may be continued volatility in sales of seasonal merchandise, impacting revenue and profitability.

2. Margin Pressure: The gross margin decreased by 35 basis points to 33.7% due to a mix of merchandise that negatively impacted margin, accelerated markdowns, and freight costs. Additionally, the mix of higher margin categories such as footwear, gifts, and decor experienced softness. This indicates potential margin pressure and challenges in maintaining profitability, especially in the face of increased competition in the retail sector.

3. Expense Management and Growth: While SG&A expenses remained flat as a percent of sales, there were factors such as consolidating the Petsense operations, onetime acquisition and integration costs, and the impact of the 53rd week, which contributed to a 16.5% growth in consolidated SG&A expenses. This raises concerns about the company's ability to effectively manage expenses and control costs, especially as it continues to expand its store base and invest in customer experience.

4. Debt and Stock Repurchase: The company ended the year with $274 million in outstanding debt, compared to $150 million the previous year. The increase in debt, coupled with the acquisition of Petsense and stock repurchases, raises questions about the company's financial leverage and its commitment to returning value to shareholders through stock repurchases.

Given these insights, it is prudent to adopt an underweight investment stance for Tractor Supply due to the potential challenges the company may face in managing weather-related sales volatility, margin pressure, expense growth, and its financial leverage. There are risks that could impact the company's future performance and profitability, warranting a cautious approach to investment.
