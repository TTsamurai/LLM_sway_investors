, but I believe we were at roughly 90 million, and we've repurchased a little bit more than that over the course of the year. So I think we're going to be modestly below where we started the year in terms of overall share count, but we'll follow up with more details for you there. And then on -- of the minority interest on industrial and healthcare materials. Yes, we took a little bit smaller loss, decline for the year. We've been, kind of, relatively consistent, if you remember, over the last couple years, the kind of mid-20s percentage. But again, as we look to kind of push more towards what our company average is, you should see that move over the next couple years, as look to really drive profitability within this sector. So again, over the next couple years, you should start to see improvement in this, and it's getting it more consistently with the company average. In terms of the headwinds you're talking on the Industrial & Healthcare Materials, those were largely acquisition-related. And again, kind of mentioned that acquiring 3 entities here this year, so that's brought in some cost there. We did have some headwinds on productivity as you mentioned, that's really been relatively consistent over the last couple of quarters. We did have some carryover from the headwinds from Q3. But I'll remind you that productivity has really been driving that margin strength for that segment over the last couple of years. Then, as we look at the improvement over the next couple years, as we look to push into higher level, you should see that improve. I think another point on this is it's going to depend on the mix of businesses within Industrial & Healthcare Materials, where we'll see this going. Sometimes you see a little bit of an inflationary environment or a modest inflationary environment, sometimes you see a little bit of constricted environment. So that's something that we're managing through as it goes. But I think overall, we're also -- last couple of quarters has been so successful. And our focus has really shifted to driving that competitive advantage across the years overall. And I would also just say, to your point, that's part of the reason on this -- on our new guidance update as well. This at the midpoint of the year, we are entering the midpoint of every year. We have raised that, and that's driven by a lot of our confidence in our ability to execute against our strategy over this course as well. So we are really pleased with where we stand and where we're headed. And on the Minority Interest for minority interest for our Industrial & Healthcare Materials segment, we do expect continued slightly positive results in that here for the overall business over the next couple years with that business. And a big part of that is really the acquisition of Yongle and a little bit of a turnaround in the base business as well. So we should see a little bit of improvement there. In terms of overall future cost of labor, that's really -- we're really not seeing anything different at this point where we're really -- have been able to manage through this point as well because I think that improves our cost structure that we've got up as well.
