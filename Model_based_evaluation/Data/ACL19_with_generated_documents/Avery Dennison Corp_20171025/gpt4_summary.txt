**Introduction:**
The recent earnings conference call provided insightful information into the company's robust financial performance and strategic positioning for the upcoming quarters. The discussion was led by the company's management, who highlighted the key achievements and strategic moves made in the last quarter.

**Financial Performance Overview:**

1. **Earnings and Revenue:**
   - The company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased by 25% year-over-year, marking a notable outperformance of expectations.
   - Sales growth reached 10% excluding currency impacts and 5.3% on an organic basis.
   - Currency translation positively impacted reported sales growth by 1% and benefitted EPS by approximately $0.02.

2. **Operating Margin and Productivity:**
   - The adjusted operating margin increased by 60 basis points to 10.4% compared to the previous year, mainly because of superior volume and productivity gains which more than offset the increased employee-related expenses. Noteworthy were approximately $14 million in net restructuring savings, largely beneficial to the RBIS segment.

3. **Tax and Cash Flow:**
   - The adjusted tax rate was reduced from 31% to 28% year-over-year.
   - Year-to-date free cash flow stood at $256 million, which is an $8 million increase from the previous period. The financial management continues to project a free cash flow conversion at nearly 100% of GAAP net income.

4. **Capital Allocation:**
   - About 400,000 shares were repurchased this quarter for a total of $35 million, leading to a modest decline in net share count.
   - The company paid out $40 million in dividends.
   - The balance sheet remains robust, offering sufficient capacity for further business investments, funding mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and continuing disciplined cash return to shareholders.

**Segment Performance:**

1. **Label and Graphic Materials (LGM):**
   - Sales in the LGM segment went up by 7% excluding currency influences driven by acquisitions and organic sales growth.
   - The adjusted operating margin in LGM improved by 40 basis points to 13.1%.

2. **Retail Branding and Information Solutions (RBIS):**

   - The adjusted operating margin expanded by 170 basis points to 8.7%.

3. **Industrial and Healthcare Materials:**
   - Excluding currency impacts, sales rose by 50% bolstered by recent acquisitions, with organic growth making a solid rebound to 3.5%.
   - However, the operating margin in this segment declined by about 3 points mainly due to acquisition-related costs.

**Outlook and Guidance:**
- The company raised the midpoint of its full-year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.10 to a new range of $4.90 to $4.95.
- Reported sales growth is now expected to be around 8% for the full year, with currency translation expected to have a neutral impact on sales and earnings.
