, but we'll definitely follow up with you on that. I guess the main takeaway here is that overall, in the quarter, we generated some really strong free cash flow growth, up another $8 million this year. We continue to expect nearly 100% free cash flow conversion on a GAAP net income, and ample capacity on the balance sheet as a result. Share buybacks and dividends have been disciplined choices for us to continue to return cash to shareholders. With share buybacks being approximately 400,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $35 million and dividends being approximately $40 million in the quarter, as Mitch mentioned. Overall, we've been pleased with our ability to return cash to shareholders and our ability to build the business at the same time. 

Overall, this conference call transcript provides a positive outlook for the company, with strong earnings, sales growth, and margin improvement. Key financial metrics such as adjusted EPS growth, sales growth excluding currency, adjusted operating margin, and free cash flow generation are highlighted throughout the call. The company is confident in its ability to execute on its strategy and is raising its guidance for the year, indicating a positive outlook for future earnings. With a strong balance sheet, the ability to invest in the business and continue to return cash to shareholders, the company is in a good position for growth. Based on the information provided, I would recommend adopting an 'overweight' investment stance for this company.
