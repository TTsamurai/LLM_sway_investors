Thank you for the details provided on the recent earnings call. Based on the information provided, it is clear that the company is facing challenges in the current environment, with sales and earnings down slightly. Inflation of $200 million to $300 million due to higher pulp costs is expected for the full year, which will impact profitability. Additionally, the company's margins were down overall and impacted by lower sales and higher input costs. The challenging environment with weaker economies, category softness, and increased competitive activity is likely to continue to pose difficulties for the company in the near term.

While the company has achieved significant cost savings through the FORCE program and is generating healthy cash flow, the current economic challenges and cost pressures suggest a cautious approach to investment. The company's outlook for the full year also indicates the need for tight management of overhead spending and capital allocation.

Considering the company's challenges and the uncertain economic environment, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company at this time. It is important for investors to carefully evaluate the company's performance and outlook before making any investment decisions.
