 for your question. Our long-term contracts will support this investment. Not to mention, the growing demand for renewables from our customers, especially data centers, military installations, and the state government. These are all positive signals for the future growth of our company. So, in conclusion, we are on track to achieve our growth plans, and we expect strong earnings growth starting next year. Thank you.
