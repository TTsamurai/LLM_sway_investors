**Future Outlook Report: Dominion Energy**

**Company Overview:**
Dominion Energy has demonstrated a strong operational and safety performance across its business units. The company's commitment to meeting and exceeding safety goals is commendable, with a notable achievement of its lowest OSHA Recordable Rate. Additionally, the company's nuclear fleet maintains a high net capacity factor, underscoring reliable operations. 

**Investment Stance: Underweight**

**Risks and Concerns:**

1. **Regulatory and Environmental Challenges:**
   - The company faces vocal opposition and regulatory hurdles, particularly with the Atlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP). Despite possessing the required permits for commencement, the project encounters resistance that could lead to delays or increased costs. This situation presents a risk of potential disruptions in project timelines and financial implications due to extended legal and environmental scrutiny.

2. **High Capital Expenditure:**
   - Dominion Energy is heavily invested in multiple large-scale projects, including the construction of the Greensville County Combined Cycle Power Station and the Cove Point Liquefaction Project. While these projects are currently on time and budget, their extensive capital requirements expose the company to financial strain if unexpected costs arise or if project timelines are extended.

3. **Dependency on Legislative and Regulatory Approvals:**
   - A significant portion of Dominion Energy's strategy relies on favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes, such as recoverable costs through rate riders and legislative support for various projects. Changes in political climate or public opinion could influence these outcomes, thereby impacting the company’s financial stability and growth projections.

**Financial Metrics and Considerations:**

- Dominion Energy anticipates a strong earnings growth starting next year, supported by completion of major projects like the ACP and the Cove Point Liquefaction Project.
- The company expects earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018, suggesting a temporary positive outlook. However, this growth is predicated on the smooth progression and operation of its major projects without regulatory or financial setbacks.
- The planned investment in the electric transmission business and infrastructure replacement programs are substantial, with commitments extending over the next decade. While these investments are projected to be recoverable through rate adjustments, there is a risk if these adjustments do not align with project costs or timelines.

**Recommendation Basis:**

Given the current insights and potential risks associated with ongoing and upcoming projects, the underweight stance is recommended primarily due to the uncertainties in regulatory approvals, heavy reliance on continued legislative support for cost recovery, and the substantial financial commitments towards capital-intensive projects. The positive factors such as expected earnings growth and operational efficiencies are noted; however, the risks seem to overshadow these aspects, thus warranting a cautious investment approach.

**Investor Consideration:**

Investors should closely monitor the developments related to regulatory approvals and community opposition, especially concerning the ACP and other major infrastructure projects. Changes in legislative support or regulatory frameworks could significantly impact projected earnings and financial stability. Additionally, operational updates on the completion and commissioning of key projects should be evaluated to assess their impact on the company’s revenue streams and cost recovery through rate adjustments.
