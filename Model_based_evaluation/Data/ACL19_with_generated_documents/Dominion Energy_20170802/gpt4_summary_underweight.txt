**Assessment and Reasons for Underweight Stance:**

- Despite strong operational performance and progression on significant infrastructure projects, the high capital expenditure across multiple projects presents substantial financial risks, especially amidst environmental concerns and regulatory uncertainties.
- Heavy reliance on recoverable costs through rate adjustments could face regulatory pushbacks or changes in legislative climate, potentially affecting profitability and financial stability.
- Potential environmental opposition might lead to delays or increased project costs, particularly concerning the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, adding to investment risk. 

**Recommendation:**
Given the combination of high capital expenditure, reliance on regulatory approvals for cost recovery, and potential environmental and regulatory headwinds, an underweight position is recommended until clearer outcomes on these fronts materialize. Continued monitoring of project advancements and regulatory environments will be crucial in reassessing this stance.
