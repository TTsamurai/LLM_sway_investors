We introduced a new product, which is from a peripheral standpoint, around wafer inspection and in metrology, where wafer flatness is really critical to advance layer developments, 3D NAND, film measurements, CE measurement, laser scanning, opportunities around defect inspection. This product addresses some of the bigger challenges in the industry. We are encouraged by what we're seeing so far and expect it to contribute to our revenue in 2018.

As for our financial performance, we achieved record collections and free cash flow in the June quarter, and our cash and investments ended the quarter at $3 billion, an increase of $313 million compared with the March quarter. We are pleased with our performance and expect free cash flow in excess of $1.1 billion for the entirety of 2017.

From a market perspective, we expect a continuation of the industry trends into the next year. While the foundry segment is expected to remain strong, we anticipate higher investment in NAND flash and a flat to slightly lower investment in DRAM. Our business is stable at these levels, and we expect our cash flow generation to remain strong going forward.

In conclusion, our outlook for the September quarter is optimistic, with shipments in the range of $945 million to $1.025 billion and revenue between $910 million and $970 million. We also expect GAAP diluted EPS of $1.48 to $1.72 per share and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.50 to $1.74 per share.

However, despite these positive indicators, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on KLA-Tencor. The company's over-reliance on foundry shipments and potential challenges in the memory segment, along with the negligible impact of new product introductions on current revenue, could be cause for concern. Additionally, the industry trends and market outlook may not be enough to support substantial growth in the coming year.
