### Future Outlook
- **Further Cost Reductions**: Expected to derive substantial savings and improved operational efficiency into the second half of the year.

### Investment Recommendation: Overweight
Given the comprehensive strategic initiatives in place aimed at reducing costs, improving operational efficiency, and focusing on high-margin businesses, it's suggested to adopt an 'overweight' stance on the investment. Although faced with immediate challenges, the restructuring and strategic realignments are anticipated to bolster the companyâ€™s growth trajectory and profitability in the medium to longer term. This positions the stock favorably for potential upside from current levels, making it an attractive investment opportunity in the technology sector.
