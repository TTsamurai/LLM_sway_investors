Okay, let's start. The company's Q2 earnings call was concerning for several reasons. The overall performance was impacted by tough markets and external factors and while there was growth in higher margin businesses, the cost structure does not align with the future HPE operating structure. Total revenue for the quarter was $9.9 billion, with revenue from continuing operations at $7.4 billion, down 5% adjusted for divestitures and currency. HPE's revenue in the U.S. was stable excluding tier 1 servers, but revenue in Europe continued to be weak. Margins were also down, with gross margin at 33.8% and non-GAAP operating profit at 7.8%. The company reported diluted net earnings per share of $0.35 from continuing operations, excluding charges for separation and restructuring. The enterprise group's revenue was down 7%, with challenges in the storage market and tier 1 server sales. Margins for the enterprise group were down 300 basis points year-over-year to 8.8%, and the margin declines were attributed to structural changes, short-term dilution from recent acquisitions, and significant impact from commodities costs in DRAM. The company does expect to drive cost savings of $200 million to $300 million in the second half of the year, but these savings are necessary to offset the margin pressures. Additionally, the company reported negative free cash flow of $64 million for the quarter, and expects full-year free cash flow of negative $1.8 billion. The company also reported significant costs related to stranded costs and M&A dilution, which will be eliminated on a run rate basis by the end of the year. In response to these challenges, the company is taking significant steps to optimize the cost structure and drive incremental cost savings. The outlook provided by the company reflects the challenges faced in Q2 and anticipates Q3 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.24 to $0.28 and full-year non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.46 to $1.56. This cautious perspective is based on the challenges faced by the company in Q2, including margin pressures, negative free cash flow, and significant cost issues. Considering these factors, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended for the company.
