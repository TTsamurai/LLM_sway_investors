Looking at the company's performance in Q2, it is evident that the tough market and external factors discussed in the last quarter impacted the overall performance. Total revenue for the quarter was $9.9 billion, which included $2.5 billion for two months of enterprise services not reported in discontinued operations. Revenue from continuing operations of $7.4 billion was down 5%, adjusted for divestitures and currency driven by declines in software and tier 1 server sales. However, excluding software and tier 1, revenue was actually up by 1%.

The company also reported that it continued to see competitive pricing and a challenging commodities environment. Additionally, gross margin decreased by 200 basis points year-over-year and 240 basis points sequentially, while non-GAAP operating profit declined by 130 basis points year-over-year and 270 basis points sequentially. These margin declines were attributed to various factors such as structural changes, short-term dilution from recent acquisitions, competitive pricing environment, and elevated commodities cost in DRAM.

In terms of business segments, the enterprise group experienced revenue declines, although some areas such as Aruba, three part all-flash arrays, high-performance compute, and technology services showed encouraging growth. However, operating margins for the enterprise group were down, mainly due to structural changes, short-term dilution from recent acquisitions, and increased commodities cost in DRAM. The company also faced challenges in areas such as server revenue, storage revenue, and networking revenue, driven by the tight SSD supplies and competitive pricing environment.

Looking ahead, the company anticipates taking significant steps to optimize the cost structure and mitigate the impact of commodities cost pressure. The company aims to drive $200 million to $300 million in cost savings in the second half of the year through tight spending control, simplifying the organizational structure, and reducing the short-term dilution from recent acquisitions. The company also expects to see improvements in margins as it stabilizes cost envelopes, grows higher margin businesses, and addresses the impact of commodities cost and pricing challenges.

From a future outlook perspective, the company expects non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.24 to $0.28 for Q3 '17, and full-year outlook for fiscal year '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.46 to $1.56. The company is also focused on capital allocation, including share buybacks and potential M&A, aligned with its strategy of fulfilling gaps in its portfolio through complementary IP and leveraging distribution for profitable growth.

In summary, while the company's Q2 performance faced challenges in terms of revenue declines, margin pressures, and cost optimization efforts, the future outlook reflects a commitment to addressing these challenges, optimizing cost structures, and driving growth in higher margin businesses for long-term success. However, the 'underweight' investment stance is recommended due to the company's current margin and revenue pressures, ongoing cost optimization efforts, and impact of external factors on its performance.
