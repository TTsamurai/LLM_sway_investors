Based on the company's recent earnings call, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The first quarter earnings per share of $1.12 exceeded the guidance and effective cost controls and better than forecasted electric fuel recoveries helped to offset the very warm weather in the first quarter. The company is affirming its guidance for 2017 and expects a long-term earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%.

The company has also made significant strides on the regulatory front. The proposed settlement agreement with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin will freeze the currently approved base rates for all Wisconsin utilities for 2018 and 2019, providing price certainty for customers. The support from a broad cross-section of industrial and commercial customers, including the three largest customers, is a positive sign for the company's regulatory efforts.

Additionally, the company's proposed $230 million investment in natural gas storage for Wisconsin utilities is progressing through the regulatory process, and the acquisition of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding will provide significant benefits to the company's customers.

The company's dividend growth continues to be in line with its earnings per share growth, and there are no immediate requirements for pension contributions.

In conclusion, the company's strong financial performance, regulatory progress, and commitment to dividend growth make it a compelling investment opportunity. I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company based on the recent earnings call. For further inquiries, please contact Beth Straka at 414-221-4639. Thank you.
