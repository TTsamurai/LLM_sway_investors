From the transcript, it's clear that the company has achieved solid sales growth of 5% in constant currency and a 5% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. This growth was driven by strong performance in high-profit channels and disciplined expense management.

However, the company faces challenges in the brick-and-mortar business in U.S. mid-tier department stores, soft consumer purchasing in the Middle East, and impact from political issues and terrorism in certain markets. These challenges, along with the strength of the U.S. dollar, are impacting the company's financial performance.

It's important to note that the company is successfully activating many elements of its growth strategy, particularly in its diverse brand portfolio. Its mid-sized and luxury brands showed impressive growth, with strong performances from brands such as Tom Ford, La Mer, Jo Malone, and others.

Looking ahead, the company expects constant currency sales growth of 6-7% for the fiscal year, including incremental sales from recent acquisitions.
