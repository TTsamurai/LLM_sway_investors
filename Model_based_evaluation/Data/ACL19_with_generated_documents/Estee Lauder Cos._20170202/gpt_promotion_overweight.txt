Based on the recent earnings call, it is clear that the company has continued to deliver solid financial performance in the second quarter. The company's sales grew by 5% in constant currency, with adjusted earnings per share increasing by 5%. The success can be attributed to strategic growth levers, strong brand performances, and successful innovation, social media, and digital engagement.

The company has successfully navigated through challenges in the U.S. mid-tier department stores, the Middle East, and Hong Kong, and is confident in the strength and sustainability of its business growth. The company has seen positive momentum across its diverse brand portfolio, with mid-sized and luxury brands performing exceptionally well. The recent acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced have further strengthened the company's presence in the prestige beauty market.

The company's diversified distribution strategy has paid off, with double-digit growth in specialty-multi retail, travel retail, and online channels. E-commerce sales have seen accelerating double-digit growth, with a significant increase in traffic and orders, particularly in China.

The company's focus on innovation and digital engagement has been successful, with several products being recognized for their innovation and the company gaining leadership in digital marketing, mobile, and social media. The company is optimistic about its growth potential, with plans to achieve constant currency sales growth of 6% to 7% in fiscal year 2017, driven by organic growth, regular price increases, increased consumer coverage, and contributions from recent acquisitions.

The company's overexposure to mid-tier department stores in the U.S. has been a challenge, but the company is successfully pivoting its business to diversify globally and adapt to changing consumer trends. The company's pivot towards online, travel retail, specialty-multi distribution, and aggressive penetration of the makeup market demonstrates its ability to adapt and thrive in a competitive industry.

Based on the company's recent performance and outlook, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company's strong brand portfolio, successful strategic growth levers, and ability to navigate through challenges demonstrate its long-term growth potential in the global prestige beauty market.
