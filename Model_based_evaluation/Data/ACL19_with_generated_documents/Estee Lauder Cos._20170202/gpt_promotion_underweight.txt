Given the recent earnings call and the current challenges faced by the company, it is advisable to recommend an 'underweight' investment stance. While the company reported strong growth in sales and earnings, there are significant challenges that may impact its future performance. The company continues to face difficulties in brick-and-mortar business in U.S. mid-tier department stores, slowdown in consumer purchasing in the Middle East, and softness in Hong Kong due to political issues and terrorism concerns. These challenges are likely to impact the company's growth prospects in the near term.

Additionally, the strength of the U.S. dollar has also penalized the company's international sales, and the overall market estimate for growth has been revised downward. Despite the positive momentum in some brands, the reliance on mid-tier department stores in the U.S. and challenges in certain international markets present a significant risk to the company's growth potential.

While the company's acquisitions of fast-growing makeup brands and the focus on online and specialty-multi distribution channels are positive steps, the uncertain outlook for certain markets and channels calls for a cautious investment stance. It is important to consider the company's overexposure to specific channels and the potential impact of ongoing challenges on its future performance. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment recommendation is warranted based on the company's recent earnings call.
