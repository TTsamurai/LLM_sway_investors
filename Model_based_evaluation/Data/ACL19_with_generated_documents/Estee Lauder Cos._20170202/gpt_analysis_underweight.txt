Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that the company has faced challenges in certain areas, such as soft traffic in U.S. mid-tier department stores and a slowdown in consumer purchasing in the Middle East. Additionally, the company has been impacted by political issues and terrorism affecting business in certain markets, as well as the strength of the U.S. dollar.

However, the company has also seen positive growth in various areas, such as the strong performance of its diverse brand portfolio, including mid-sized and luxury brands, and the success of recent acquisitions of high-growth prestige makeup brands. The company has also made significant strides in digital engagement and online sales growth, particularly in China.

The company's strategy of diversifying distribution channels to expand consumer coverage is showing promise, with strong performances in specialty-multi retail, travel retail, and online sales. The company's focus on mobile engagement and social media has also been successful in driving sales and engaging consumers.

Based on the outlook provided in the conference call, the company expects constant currency sales growth of 6% to 7% in fiscal year 2017, including approximately 1% incremental sales from recent acquisitions. The company also anticipates stronger sales and profit acceleration in the second half of the year, driven by organic growth, regular price increases, increased consumer coverage, and contributions from recent acquisitions.

However, it is important to note that the company's challenges in certain markets and distribution channels, as well as the impact of the U.S. dollar, may continue to affect its future performance. As a financial analyst adopting an 'underweight' investment stance, it is crucial to consider these challenges and the potential impact on the company's financial performance and stock valuation. Additional research and analysis of key financial metrics, including revenue growth, operating margin, and cash flow, would be essential to support the decision to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company.
