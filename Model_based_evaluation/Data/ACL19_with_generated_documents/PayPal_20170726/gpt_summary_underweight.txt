 for coordinating the call. Now, as a financial analyst adopting an 'underweight' investment stance, it is important to focus on key financial metrics and assess the overall performance of PayPal. Despite the company's positive outlook and strong financial results, it is essential to dig deeper into the financial metrics to understand the potential risks and challenges that could impact the investment decision.

Firstly, let's analyze the revenue growth and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share. PayPal achieved a record revenue of 3.136 billion, representing 20% of FX-neutral growth. The non-GAAP earnings per diluted share also increased by 27% year-over-year. These metrics indicate strong financial performance and growth potential for the company.

The non-GAAP operating margin also grew by 110 basis points to 21%, further highlighting the company's operational efficiency and profitability.

In addition to these financial metrics, it is important to consider the customer metrics, such as net new active accounts and customer engagement. PayPal gained 6.5 million net new active accounts, the largest in the past three years, and saw a 10% increase in customer engagement. These metrics reflect the company's ability to attract and retain customers, which is essential for long-term growth and sustainability.

Furthermore, PayPal's payment volume exceeded 100 billion in quarterly TPV for the first time, with mobile payment volume increasing by 50% year-over-year. This indicates the company's strong position in the mobile payment market and its ability to adapt to changing consumer behaviors.

Lastly, it is crucial to evaluate the impact of strategic partnerships and expansion initiatives on the company's financial performance. PayPal has formed major partnerships with Visa, Mastercard, Google, Apple, Facebook, and Samsung, expanding its reach and enhancing its value proposition. These partnerships are expected to drive enhanced value to mutual customers and contribute to future growth.

Despite these positive financial and customer metrics, it is important to exercise caution when considering an investment in PayPal. The company's strong performance is also indicative of its high valuation and potential market risks. The competitive landscape in the digital payments industry is also evolving rapidly, and PayPal may face challenges from emerging competitors and regulatory changes.

In conclusion, given the strong financial results and performance metrics, PayPal presents a compelling investment opportunity. However, the 'underweight' investment stance is recommended due to potential market risks and the need for careful consideration of the company's valuation and competitive position. Detailed analysis of these financial metrics and a thorough assessment of the market environment is essential for making informed investment decisions.
