**Strategic Acquisitions and Integration**
Salesforce's acquisition strategy, highlighted by the seamless integration of Demandware into its Commerce Cloud, signifies its operational excellence. The company is not merely expanding its product portfolio; it is enhancing its core capabilities and extending its market dominance—further evidenced by Salesforce’s capability to double its $20 million-plus relationships in just one year.

**Expanding International Reach and Industry-Specific Solutions**
The company has recorded significant wins in strategic international markets, particularly in EMEA and Asia, indicating successful penetration and acceptance of its international growth strategy. The earnings call cited major customer wins and expanded relationships with global giants like Shell, Banco Santander, and multiple top-tier banks across Europe, demonstrating Salesforce's ability to scale globally while addressing industry-specific needs.
