 of the business and supports our long-term margin expansion opportunity. Thank you. Thank you for providing the transcripts. Based on the information provided in the earnings call, it is evident that the company is highlighting its strong performance in the second quarter and its confidence in its long-term margin expansion opportunity. The company's focus on strengthening its top line performance through modernized brands and a strong innovation slate is a positive factor. However, it is important to note that the company has experienced elevated inflation, which has pressured gross margins. The company's focus on strategic investments behind higher quality product presentation and brand-specific investments may impact short-term margin performance. Additionally, the company's continued commitment to M&A to reshape its portfolio and drive long-term growth and margins may introduce a level of uncertainty. The company's emphasis on driving brand saliency and increasing distribution, merchandising, and consumer trial through strategic investments may impact the bottom line in the near term. Considering these factors, a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company's investment stance may be warranted, recommending an 'underweight' position. It is important to monitor the company's ability to navigate the impact of inflation on gross margins, the success of its innovation slate, and the long-term impact of its strategic investments on the bottom line.
