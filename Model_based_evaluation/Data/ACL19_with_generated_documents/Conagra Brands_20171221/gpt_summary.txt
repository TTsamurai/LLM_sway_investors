In summary, our company remains on track with our transformation plan, achieving organic net sales growth ahead of schedule and reaffirming our long-term margin expansion opportunities. Our strategic investments in renovation and innovation have resulted in positive growth across our U.S. retail businesses, particularly in the Refrigerated and Frozen segment, and Grocery and Snacks segment. Our focus on improving brand saliency and increasing sales velocity has allowed us to price above our categories and reduce reliance on inefficient trade promotions. We continue to be active in pursuing value-enhancing M&A and have recently completed the acquisitions of Angie's Artisan Treats and Sandwich Bros. We are encouraged by our return to growth and our innovation slate, and have updated our 2018 guidance to reflect this positive performance. Our commitment to disciplined and strategic investments, above and below the line, will continue to drive distribution, merchandising, and trial to support our brands. We are positioned for long-term strength and value creation and remain confident in our future.
