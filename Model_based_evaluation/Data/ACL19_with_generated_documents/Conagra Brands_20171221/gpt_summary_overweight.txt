 that supports our long-term growth. Turning to our financial metrics, there are several key metrics that indicate our strong performance in the second quarter. First, organic net sales grew by 2.3% in the quarter, driven by strong volume performance in our U.S. retail businesses. This growth is a clear affirmation of our plan and aggressive actions to jumpstart the top line. We also estimate a 220 basis point benefit related to hurricanes during the quarter, indicating the underlying strength of our core business. Additionally, our distribution performance, measured by total points of distribution, is continuing to improve, with expectations of moving upward in the back half. This trend is supported by net gains as the pruning of low-performing skews abates and innovation continues to roll out. Furthermore, our sales velocity has improved, leading to positive dollar sales performance in the second quarter. We have also continued to price above our categories on average, demonstrating our strong volume performance was not driven by deep discounts or price rollbacks. This is aligned with our value-over-volume strategy, aiming for sustained growth over the long term. In terms of margin performance, we remain on track to deliver against our 2020 margin goals. While we faced near-term factors impacting gross margin performance in Q2, we are confident in our long-term margin outlook and our commitment to improve profitability over time. Overall, our innovation slate is building distribution and performing well, and we are encouraged by the success of our acquisitions, such as Angie's Boom Chicka Pop and Sandwich Bros., which bolster our position in the important Snacks and Frozen categories. These acquisitions present exciting expansions and capabilities in the on-trend format. Moving forward, we will continue to make strategic investments and remain active in our pursuit of value-enhancing M&A. In conclusion, our strong year-to-date performance has led us to update our 2018 guidance to reflect organic net sales and adjusted EPS to be near the high end of their respective guidance ranges. We are confident in our future and remain relentlessly focused on value creation. Our detailed financial metrics and performance in the second quarter support an 'overweight' investment stance in our company.
