3. **Highest Annual MAUs:** For the year, Blizzard recorded its highest annual MAUs, up 37% from 2015 and 87% from 2014.

**Strategic Achievements:**
1. **Launching Groundbreaking Titles:** Overwatch, a major release in May, exhibited the strongest launch year financial performance in Blizzard’s 26-year history with 25 million registered players, surpassing previous records.
