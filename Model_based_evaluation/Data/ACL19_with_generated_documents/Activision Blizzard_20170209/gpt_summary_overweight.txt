Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is clear that Activision Blizzard had an outstanding performance in 2016, exceeding initial revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance. Key financial metrics to consider include the following:

1. Revenue Growth: The company surpassed its initial revenue guidance by $0.5 billion and achieved its highest annual MAUs ever, with an increase of 37% from 2015 and up 87% since 2014.

2. MAUs: Monthly Active Users (MAUs) for Blizzard and Activision reached record levels, with Blizzard's MAUs up over 20% for the year and Activision's highest annual MAUs ever, up 3% from 2015 and up 23% since 2014.

3. Player Engagement: The company saw over 10 billion hours of playtime in Q4, with a total of 43 billion hours of engagement in 2016, on par with Netflix and 1.5 times Snapchat. This demonstrates strong player engagement with the company's games.

4. In-Game Purchases: The company achieved record in-game revenues in 2016, with in-game purchases close to $1 billion in the quarter and a total of $3.8 billion for the year, more than double last year's $1.7 billion. This growth in in-game purchases showcases the company's ability to monetize its player base effectively.

5. Future Opportunities: The company is focused on providing opportunities for more player investments, with plans to release new content for its popular franchises such as Call of Duty, Destiny, and King's mobile games.

Based on these financial metrics and the strong performance indicated in the transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance on Activision Blizzard. The company's record-setting year, combined with its plans for future growth opportunities, position it as a promising investment option in the gaming industry.
