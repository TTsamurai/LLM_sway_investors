Thank you for the detailed insight into the recent earnings conference call. After analyzing the information provided, it is clear that Activision Blizzard has had a successful year in terms of performance metrics, particularly with regards to audience reach, engagement, and player investment. However, there are certain concerns that have led us to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance.

Firstly, while the company has reported impressive revenue and EPS growth, it is important to consider the unexpected underperformance of certain game releases, such as Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. This suggests a potential risk in the company's ability to accurately forecast and deliver products that resonate with their audience. It is also concerning that the space-setting theme in the game did not resonate with a portion of the audience, indicating a lack of understanding of consumer preferences.

Additionally, while the company has seen growth in in-game purchases and player engagement, there is a need to ensure that this momentum is sustainable. The reliance on in-game purchases as a significant revenue stream may pose a risk if consumer preferences shift or if there are changes in regulations around microtransactions in games.

Furthermore, while the company has demonstrated a strong commitment to e-sports and community engagement, there is a need to evaluate the long-term profitability and viability of these initiatives. While e-sports has shown potential as a stand-alone opportunity, the company should carefully assess the return on investment and potential market saturation in this space.

In conclusion, while Activision Blizzard has shown strong performance in key financial metrics, the aforementioned concerns lead us to recommend an ‘underweight’ investment stance. It is important for investors to closely monitor the company's ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences and to sustain growth in the face of potential risks.
