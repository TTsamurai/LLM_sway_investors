Based on the earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The following key financial metrics support this recommendation:

1. Net interest margin (NIM) improvement: The company reported a 4 basis points improvement in NIM, driven by higher loan yields and a steeper yield curve. This resulted in a $35 million sequential increase in net interest income.

2. Focus on optimizing loan portfolio: The company's focus on optimizing the loan portfolio led to a 5-6 basis points expansion in NIM in the first quarter, with the potential for further expansion depending on the interest rate environment.

3. Strong balance sheet growth: The company reported a $96 million year-over-year increase in net interest income as a result of strong balance sheet growth.

4. Cost management and efficiency: The company reported a decrease in non-interest expense and a 65 basis points decline in the tangible efficiency ratio, demonstrating a commitment to smart growth and efficiency.

5. Asset quality and loan growth: The company experienced a 5% loan growth in 2016 and maintained good overall asset quality, with a relatively stable allowance ratio.

Based on these metrics, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance, as the company's focus on optimizing its loan portfolio, strong balance sheet growth, cost management, and efficiency improvements bode well for future profitability and potential returns for investors.
