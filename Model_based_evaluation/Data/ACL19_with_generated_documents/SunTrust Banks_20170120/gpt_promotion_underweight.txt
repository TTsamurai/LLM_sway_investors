Based on the recent earnings call of the company, there are several reasons to be cautious and skeptical about the company's performance and future prospects. 

Firstly, the net interest margin improved, driven by higher loan yields as a result of short-term rate increase and a steeper yield curve. This improvement is expected to continue in the first quarter, but the sustainability of this improvement is dependent on the interest rate environment. 

Secondly, non-interest income declined due to lower refinancing activity and increased hedging costs in the mortgage business. While servicing income is expected to return to a normalized run rate in the first quarter, it is unclear whether this trend will continue in the future given the volatility of the rate environment. 

Thirdly, the company's expenses have increased due to investments in driving growth, improved business performance, technology investments, and increased regulatory and compliance costs. While the company is focused on managing expenses, the outlook for expense growth remains uncertain. 

Additionally, the company's asset quality remains good, but there are concerns about higher charge-offs in auto and CRE, as well as the abating reserve releases related to the home equity portfolio. 

Furthermore, the company's outlook for 2017 includes revenue headwinds in the mortgage business, increased FDIC expenses, and an overall decline in mortgage business across the country.

Overall, based on the cautious and skeptical perspective presented in the earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. The uncertain interest rate environment, declining non-interest income, increasing expenses, and potential revenue headwinds in the mortgage business all contribute to the cautious outlook for the company's performance.
