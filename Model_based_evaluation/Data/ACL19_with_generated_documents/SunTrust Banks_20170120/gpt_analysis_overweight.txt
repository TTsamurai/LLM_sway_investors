Based on the insights and financial metrics from the recent earnings conference call transcript, I have prepared a future outlook report for SunTrust, adopting an 'overweight' investment stance. Here are the key points:

1. Net Interest Margin (NIM) Improvement: The company has seen a 4 basis points improvement in NIM due to higher loan yields and a steeper yield curve. The company anticipates further NIM expansion by 5 or 6 basis points in the first quarter. This is a positive indicator for potential revenue growth.

2. Non-Interest Income Decline: Non-interest income declined primarily due to lower mortgage activity and higher servicing expenses. However, the servicing income is expected to return to a normalized run rate north of $50 million in the first quarter.

3. Expense Management: The company has been successful in managing non-interest expenses, primarily driven by cost-saving measures such as renegotiating contracts and optimizing branch networks. This focus on efficiency is expected to continue and lead to a tangible efficiency ratio of sub-60% by 2019.

4. Asset Quality: The company has made significant progress in working through problem energy credits, leading to a reduction in non-performing loans ratio and an increase in net charge-off ratio. Overall, the asset quality remains very good.

5. Loan and Deposit Growth: The company has seen solid loan growth, particularly in consumer lending and commercial and industrial loans. Average client deposits have also increased, reflecting broad-based growth across consumer and wholesale banking.

6. Capital and Dividend Strategy: The company's estimated Basel III common equity tier-1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis is 9.5%, providing capacity for deploying capital and returning capital to shareholders through increased dividends and buybacks. The management aims to continue increasing dividends and buybacks over the next couple of years.

Based on these insights, the future outlook for SunTrust appears positive. The company's focus on NIM expansion, expense management, asset quality, and growth in loans and deposits, coupled with its strong capital position, provides a favorable investment opportunity. The anticipated return of servicing income and the potential for increased efficiency further support an 'overweight' investment stance.
