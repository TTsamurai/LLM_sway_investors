 Thank you for joining us today. I'm here to discuss our third quarter results and provide some insights into our recent earnings conference call transcripts. Our CEO, Dan Glaser, talked about the heightened level of natural and man-made catastrophe losses, including major hurricanes, typhoons, earthquakes, wildfires, senseless acts of violence, and large scale cyber events that have impacted our industry. Despite these losses, the insurance industry has the capital strength and resilience to absorb them. The potential market impact of these events is still uncertain, and it may result in more of an earnings event than a capital event requiring a reloading of capital.

In terms of financial metrics, our consolidated top-line growth was 7%, with underlying revenue growth of 3%. Our operating income increased by 4%, and adjusted operating income rose by 11%. Earnings per share (EPS) was $0.76, with adjusted EPS increasing by 14% to $0.79. Our adjusted margin improved by 70 basis points. Additionally, our reported revenue growth for the nine-month period was 5%, while underlying revenue growth was 3%. EPS for the nine-month period grew by 11% on a GAP basis and 13% on an adjusted basis.

Looking at our risk and insurance services, third quarter revenue was $1.8 billion, with reported growth of 8% and underlying revenue growth of 3%. Adjusted operating income increased by 12% to $337 million, with the margin expanding by 60 basis points to 19.1%. For the consulting segment, third quarter revenue was $1.6 billion, increasing by 5% on a reported basis and 2% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income also increased by 7% in the quarter to $330 million, with the margin up by 40 basis points.

Our CFO, Mark McGivney, addressed the uncertainty around the market impact of recent losses, emphasizing the competitive nature of the insurance market and our focus on providing comprehensive coverage at competitive terms for our clients.

Overall, we continue to expect underlying revenue growth in the 3% to 5% range, margin expansion across both operating segments, and strong growth in adjusted EPS for the full year 2017.

In summary, the recent earnings conference call highlighted the challenges and uncertainties posed by recent catastrophic events, but also showcased our company's resilience and strong financial performance in the face of these challenges. Thank you for your time and insights.
