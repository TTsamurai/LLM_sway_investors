Based on the recent earnings call of Hologic, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company reported solid results in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, with both revenue and earnings per share exceeding guidance. The success of the company's turnaround to-date has been based largely on improved execution by its U.S. commercial teams, stabilization of market-leading products, and optimization of innovative growth drivers. International growth also showed improvement after four consecutive quarters of declines in fiscal 2016.

The company's sales grew by 5.6% on a reported basis and 6.3% in constant currency, with strong performance in both the U.S. and international markets. Divisional performance demonstrated continued growth, particularly in the Surgical and Diagnostics segments. The company also successfully divested its blood screening business, which provided significant financial flexibility for future growth through acquisitions and capital deployment activities.

Furthermore, the company's strong position in the market, continued product innovation, and growth opportunities in international markets make it an attractive investment option with potential for future growth. Therefore, it is recommended to take an overweight investment stance on Hologic based on its recent earnings call and performance.
