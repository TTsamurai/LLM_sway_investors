Based on the information provided in the earning call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance in Hologic. The company's revenue, while showing growth, has been attributed to short-term factors such as extra selling days and initial sales to support investigational testing for the Zika virus. Additionally, the performance of the Skeletal Health division is of concern, as it has shown a decrease in revenue. The company's international growth, while starting to show progress, is still in the early stages and may take a few more years to significantly contribute to overall revenue. The company's recent divestiture of its blood screening business, while seen as a positive move, may also limit future growth opportunities. Overall, the company's growth prospects may not be as strong as they are portrayed and may warrant a more cautious investment stance.
