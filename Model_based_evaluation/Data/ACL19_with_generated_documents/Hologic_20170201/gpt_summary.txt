Overall, the recent earnings conference call transcripts from Hologic show positive growth trends in revenue and EPS in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Key financial metrics include revenue growth to $734.4 million, a 5.6% increase on a reported basis, or 6.3% in constant currency. This growth is attributed to strong results from the U.S. commercial teams and international growth after four consecutive quarters of declines. 

The Surgical division remained a growth leader, posting 17.2% sales increase in the first quarter. MyoSure and NovaSure were key contributors to this growth. In the Diagnostics division, molecular diagnostics sales grew 8.8% and international sales grew 25.8%, driven by new leadership, record Panther placements, and increasing assay pull-through on those instruments. 

The Breast Health division saw global sales of $273.3 million, a 4.6% increase. Domestic placements of the Genius 3D mammography systems increased modestly, with significant conversion opportunities ahead. 

On the financial flexibility side, the divestiture of the blood screening business to Grifols for $1.85 billion in cash significantly strengthened Hologic's balance sheet. The company aims to use this financial flexibility to grow through acquisitions and other capital deployment activities.

Regarding international growth and business development, the company is making progress in building a stronger foundation for future growth, especially in regions such as Europe and Latin America. The business development team is focusing on disciplined decision-making and leveraging existing channels for growth opportunities.

Looking ahead, Hologic expects the next chapter of their growth story to come from new products, international growth, and business development. While there are still challenges to address, the company is off to a good start in 2017 and aims to maintain disciplined and focused strategies to drive sustainable growth.
