Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, Hologic's financial performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 has shown solid results, with both revenue and earnings per share exceeding guidance. The company has indicated progress in its turnaround from a sustainable growth company, with improved execution by its U.S. commercial teams and continued growth in its international sales.

The company's revenue of $734.4 million grew 5.6% on a reported basis, or 6.3% in constant currency, with strong growth in the U.S. and international markets. The Surgical division has posted its eighth straight quarter of double-digit growth globally, with MyoSure leading the way by posting strong growth. Additionally, the Diagnostics division has shown growth in molecular diagnostics and blood screening sales, despite slight declines in cytology and perinatal sales.

Furthermore, the company has divested its blood screening business, which has significantly strengthened its balance sheet and increased its financial flexibility for future growth through acquisitions and other capital deployment activities. The divestiture is expected to remove a drag on the company's growth and contribute to increased revenues and EPS at a faster rate.

While the company has indicated positive growth in key divisions such as Surgical and Diagnostics, and has emphasized the potential for further growth through international expansion and new product development efforts, the company's Skeletal Health division has shown underperformance, with a decrease in revenues of 10.7%.

In summary, despite the company's positive financial performance and growth opportunities, the underperformance in the Skeletal Health division and the need for international expansion to fully realize potential growth may warrant an 'underweight' investment stance. It's important to carefully analyze the company's growth prospects and financial metrics in light of the strength and weaknesses highlighted in the recent earnings conference call.
