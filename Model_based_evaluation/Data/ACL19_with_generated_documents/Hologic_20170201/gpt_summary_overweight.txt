Summary: 
Hologic had a solid first quarter in fiscal 2017, with revenue exceeding guidance and both international and new products contributing to growth. The divestiture of the blood screening business has increased financial flexibility for the company to pursue growth through acquisitions and other capital deployment activities. The Surgical division continued to be the growth leader, with MyoSure and NovaSure leading the way. Diagnostics posted growth in molecular diagnostics and blood screening, while cytology and perinatal sales were modest. Breast Health saw modest growth in global sales, with domestic placements of the Genius 3D mammography systems increasing. Skeletal Health revenues decreased. Going forward, the company is looking to leverage its assets and continue to expand its international business, especially in Latin America, Asia Pacific, Canada, and Europe. Business development activities are also a priority for future growth. Overall, the company is off to a good start in 2017 and is in a strong position for future growth.
