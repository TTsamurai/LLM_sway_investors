The first quarter revenue increased 18% from a year ago to $984 million. Gross margin improved driven largely by the success of recently launched Ryzen CPUs. Revenues in Computing and Graphics segment delivered fourth straight quarters of double-digit percentage year-on-year revenue growth. Strong demand for Ryzen CPUs and improved GPU sales resulted in revenue increasing by 29% from the year ago period. Ryzen CPUs have consistently ranked among the top-selling processors at global retailers, resulting in the highest desktop processor revenue in more than two years. In Graphics, GPU sales increased by a strong double-digit percentage from a year ago based on growth across all product lines. The company remains on track to launch the first products from their next-generation Radeon Vega family later this quarter. Revenue in the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment increased by 5% from a year ago, driven by game console offerings from Sony and Microsoft, as well as by the FinFET-based semi-custom offerings. The company is on track to launch the first Naples products this quarter and expects to see a reasonable ramp in the second quarter. The company is also making targeted investments in GPUs and servers and plans to ensure a long-term roadmap for PCs, GPUs, and servers.
