Based on the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, there are several key financial metrics to consider when adopting an 'underweight' investment stance:

1. Revenue Growth: The company reported a 18% increase in first quarter revenue from a year ago. While this is a positive indicator, it's important to assess whether this growth is sustainable and can be maintained in the future.

2. Gross Margin Expansion: The company also reported improved gross margin, driven largely by the success of its new Ryzen CPUs. This is a positive indicator of profitability, but it's important to investigate whether this margin expansion can continue and whether it is consistent across all product lines.

3. Segment Performance: The Computing and Graphics segment delivered strong revenue growth, driven by Ryzen CPUs and improved GPU sales. This indicates potential success in the company's core business, but it's important to assess the sustainability of this growth and whether it can offset declines in other segments.

4. Product Launches and Reception: The company's recent product launches, such as Ryzen CPUs and Radeon RX 500 GPUs, received positive reviews and demonstrated strong performance and value proposition. It's important to monitor ongoing customer reception and market demand for these products.

5. Operating Expenses and Investments: The company mentioned targeted investments in GPUs and server R&D, which may impact overall operating expenses. It's important to analyze whether these investments will translate into long-term profitability and growth.

6. Guidance for the Future: The company provided guidance for the second quarter, anticipating additional revenue growth driven by the ramp of Ryzen products and semi-custom offerings. It's important to monitor whether this guidance is achievable and whether the company can sustain this growth trajectory.

Overall, while the company has reported positive financial metrics and product performance, it's important to carefully assess the sustainability of these indicators, potential market competition, and the company's ability to maintain profitability and growth in the long term before making an investment decision.
