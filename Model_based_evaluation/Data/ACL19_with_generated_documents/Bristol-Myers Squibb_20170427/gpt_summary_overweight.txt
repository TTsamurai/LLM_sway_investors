Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, Bristol-Myers Squibb had an outstanding quarter with strong performance across the company. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.84, up $0.10 over the first quarter of last year. Revenue grew by 12%, with double-digit growth across key growth drivers. Sales for Opdivo were strong, particularly outside lung cancer. Progress was made in international access and reimbursement, as well as regulatory approvals in the U.S. and Japan.

The company's diversified portfolio showed promising data in immuno-oncology and other therapeutic areas such as NASH and autoimmune diseases. Eliquis continued to perform well and is the leading NOAC in the U.S. The company continues to focus on a balanced approach to capital allocation, prioritizing business development, and building translational capabilities.

The company has a broad approach to first-line lung cancer and expects important data readouts for Opdivo and Yervoy in renal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, and small-cell lung cancer in the next 12 months. Additionally, the company is pursuing opportunities in fibrosis and immuno-science portfolios.

Bristol-Myers Squibb has a strong pipeline and is focused on delivering the value of its promising pipeline, which is the broadest and deepest the company has had. The company is also committed to vigorously defending its IP across the board and partnering with Ono on any IP-related issues.

Overall, the company is in a strong position financially, commercially, and clinically and is well-positioned to continue growing and playing an even more important role in the lives of patients. Based on these financial metrics and the promising pipeline, an 'overweight' investment stance can be adopted for Bristol-Myers Squibb.
