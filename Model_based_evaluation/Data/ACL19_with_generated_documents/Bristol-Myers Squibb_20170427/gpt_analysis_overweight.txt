2. Product performance: Sales for Opdivo were strong, especially in international markets, with growth in renal, melanoma, head and neck, and bladder indications.

3. Regulatory progress: The company made significant progress with regulatory approvals for Opdivo in bladder cancer in the US, in head and neck cancer in Japan, and received positive recommendations for bladder and head and neck in Europe.

4. Pipeline and portfolio: The company has a diverse portfolio with multiple new mechanisms in addition to PD-1 and CTLA-4 in clinical development, with upcoming data readouts for Opdivo and Yervoy in renal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, small-cell lung cancer, and other tumor types.
