 impacts as they come. So, I don't really think it changes our strategy. I think we just continue to focus on executing what we've been doing and continuing to cater to the needs of our customers. I think one of the key takeaways from the conference call transcript is the company's focus on delivering disciplined, profitable growth as part of its three-year plan. This disciplined approach is evident through the company's efforts to provide value to local customers through innovative product offerings and value-added services. The company's focus on accelerating growth with local customers is working, as evidenced by the consistent improvement in loyalty scores for the company.

The company's ability to manage the deflationary environment well and its anticipation of overall modest inflation in the near future is a positive sign for future growth. The company's gross profit growth and gross margin expansion in U.S. Foodservice Operations is notable, especially in a challenging deflationary environment. Additionally, the company's focus on expense management and ongoing process improvements in the supply chain area is driving efficiencies and improving operating expense trends.

Furthermore, the company's integration of acquired businesses, such as the Brakes Group, and its efforts to streamline administrative expenses in the Canadian business are expected to contribute to continued positive performance. The company's expansion into new markets, such as Costa Rica and Panama, also indicates future growth potential.

Overall, the company's consistent execution of its strategic initiatives and its focus on delivering value to customers while maintaining a disciplined, profitable approach bodes well for future success. Based on these insights and financial metrics derived from the conference call transcript, the company demonstrates strong potential for future growth and an 'overweight' investment stance is justified.
