 impacts. So, I don't think that necessarily has changed the competitive nature. We are still focused on delivering value to our customers and continuing to grow our business. In terms of the second part of your question about gross profit dollars versus gross margin, we do encourage you to think about how we are driving gross profit dollars over time and how we are managing expenses to drive profitability. It's important to focus on the overall financial health of the company and our ability to generate and manage gross profit dollars effectively. Overall, we believe that our strategic initiatives and focus on local customers are driving solid financial results, and we are confident in our ability to continue delivering on our financial objectives as part of our three-year plan. Thank you.
