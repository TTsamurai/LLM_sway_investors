 issues. But as far as kind of the share gains, I feel really good about where we're at and where we're going. I think our value proposition continues to resonate very well with customers. I think as you think about all these different programs around health and product innovation and all the technology support, it's really just allowing our associates to execute at a high level and continue to gain more customers and more business from those customers. And so, I'd say, as we think about our holding an underweight investment stance, the recent earnings conference call transcript presents a mixed picture. While the U.S. Foodservice Operations segment delivered solid performance with strong growth in local customer sales and gross profit, there are concerns about declining case volume for the multi-unit business. Additionally, the deflationary environment is starting to shift towards inflation, and the impact on gross margin improvement remains uncertain. There are also challenges in the international and Canadian segments due to market conditions and operational improvements. The company's focus on expense management and improving efficiency is a positive sign, but there are still areas for improvement. Overall, the company's financial performance does not warrant a strong investment stance at this time.
