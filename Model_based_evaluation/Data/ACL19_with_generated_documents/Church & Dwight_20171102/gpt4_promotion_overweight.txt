**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Company Reports Robust Growth and Expands International Footprint: Recommending an Overweight Investment Stance**

Dear Investors,

In light of our recent earnings call, it is with great enthusiasm that we recommend an "overweight" investment stance on Company A. The third quarter results have not only exceeded expectations but have positioned us uniquely in the market to capitalize on new growth opportunities. Here's a breakdown of why Company A stands out as a superior investment opportunity.

**Impressive Organic and Acquisition Driven Growth**
Company A has reported an admirable 11.2% growth this quarter, driven substantially by organic sales and strategic acquisitions like Waterpik. Our organic growth stood strong at 3.2%, propelled by a 7.1% increase in domestic volume. This showcases our ability to expand our market share organically, a testament to our robust business model and operational excellence.

**Strategic International Expansions**
The International Consumer business and Specialty Products business turned in extraordinary performance with significant numbers. Particularly, our International Consumer business exhibited a stellar 6.2% organic growth, surpassing our annual target. The establishment of new subsidiaries in Germany and offices in Singapore and Panama are strategic moves that have begun to yield substantial returns, reinforcing our commitment to becoming a global leader in our industry.

**Innovations and Market Leadership**
Innovations such as the Triple Chamber unit dose in laundry care and SLIDE in pet care products have fortified our market position. Notably, ARM & HAMMER liquid detergent celebrated 31 consecutive quarters of market share growth. Our new innovations continue to outperform, with BATISTE in dry shampoo achieving a remarkable 33% category share.

**Acquisitions Adding Value**
The recent acquisition of Waterpik is a strategic addition to our portfolio, already showing promising results. It expands our reach in the personal health care sector and aligns with growing consumer awareness around gum health. Integration efforts have been smooth and are projected to deliver substantial synergistic benefits, especially with our extensive international network.

**Financial Robustness**
Company A is on track to achieve 8.5% full-year earnings growth. The focus on targeted investment spending has converted efficiently into revenue growth, which is a clear indicator of our prudent and effective management strategy. Furthermore, our financial health is stable, and we are well-positioned to continue our growth trajectory.

**Forward-Looking Opportunities**
Our deep dive into the Asian markets and strengthening positions in existing areas display our forward-looking approach and ability to adapt to dynamic market conditions. The focus on expanding digital and online sales channels, especially noted within the Waterpik segment, outlines our adaptability to modern retail trends.

In conclusion, Company A's strategic positioning, combined with robust financial performance and forward-looking growth strategies, make it an exceptionally compelling investment option. We are confident in our long-term growth algorithm and recommend investors to take an "overweight" stance, anticipating markedly higher returns relative to the market.

Thank you for your continued trust and investment in Company A. We look forward to another prosperous quarter and are excited for what lies ahead.
