Based on the recent earnings call, the company has reported strong organic growth and successful acquisitions, particularly with the Waterpik acquisition. The company's targeted investment spending has led to share growth across various product categories.

Furthermore, the company is on track to achieve 8.5% full year earnings growth, with the International Consumer business exceeding expectations with 6.2% organic growth. The company has been making strategic investments in its international business, with a focus on expanding into Asia.

In terms of specific product categories, the laundry, litter, dry shampoo, adult gummy, and condom categories have shown growth and share gains.

Despite competition and pricing pressures in the vitamin business, the company is implementing new strategies to break through the noise and expects growth in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the company is not concerned about the impact of Amazon's private label in the gummy vitamin category, as they are the number one gummy on Amazon.
