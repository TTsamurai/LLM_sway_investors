### Key Takeaways from the Earnings Conference Call

#### Financial Summary
- **Revenue Growth**: Revenue growth for Q4 was 24.2%, driven by acquisitions and organic growth in internal storage revenue, despite minor foreign exchange headwinds and impacts from divestitures. Internal storage rental revenue growth was 2.9% for the quarter.
  
- **Adjusted EBITDA**: Improved to 31.7% margins in Q4 from 31.2% in Q3, benefiting from the Transformation Initiative and Recall synergies. Full-year adjusted EBITDA was in line with guidance, despite the lower profitability from the legacy Recall business.

- **Adjusted Funds from Operations (AFFO)**: Ended at the high end of the forecast range due to optimized capital expenditures, with about 80% of capital expenditure reductions being permanent improvements.

- **Net Synergies**: Achieved a $65 million annual run rate in synergies from the Recall integration, progressing towards the goal of $80 million by the end of the next fiscal year.

#### Strategic Initiatives & Forward-Looking Statements
- **Recall Integration**: Continued robust integration efforts are showing tangible results, with significant cost synergies being realized and more expected in 2017, contributing to profitability.

- **Transformation Initiative**: Continues to drive efficiency and cost control, contributing positively to margin improvement.

- **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)**: A refinement in CapEx strategy has led to a declination in unnecessary spending and deferring some expenses into 2017, with long-term benefits expected from these adjustments.

- **Real Estate Strategy**: Emphasis on optimizing the real estate portfolio through strategic sales and acquisitions in key markets to enhance operational efficiency and cost structure.

#### Changes in Financial Reporting
- **Terminology Adjustments**: Switch from 'Adjusted OIBDA' to 'Adjusted EBITDA' for clarity and consistency with industry standards. Adjustment in AFFO calculation to exclude discretionary growth capital and include full depreciation and amortization.

#### Challenges and Risks
- **Foreign Exchange Fluctuations**: Minor impacts noticed but managed through effective hedging strategies.
  
- **Market Volatility**: Remains proactive against market fluctuations, particularly concerning recycled paper pricing and other input costs.

#### Future Outlook
- **2017 Guidance**: Expects continued growth in storage rental revenues between 2% to 2.5% and an adjusted EBITDA growth of around 17.5%. AFFO is forecasted to increase by 11.5% at the midpoint from the previous year.

- **Long-Term Goals**: The company aims to further expand adjusted EBITDA margins by approximately 200 basis points by the end of 2017, mainly through operational efficiencies and continued synergy realizations from the Recall integration.

#### Operational Highlights
- **Customer Base Expansion**: Successful in growing the customer base, particularly within North American markets, recording robust internal storage rental revenue growth.

- **Service Revenue**: Service revenues saw a 24.8% increase in Q4, although there was a slight internal decline due to reduced activities in certain segments.

### Conclusion
The company is positioned well financially with strong Q4 performance indicators and strategic initiatives taking shape effectively, driving both top-line growth and bottom-line improvements. Future prospects remain robust with clear strategic direction, ongoing synergies realization, and solid financial guidance for 2017.
