. The company reported strong internal storage rental revenue growth of 2.9% excluding Recall and other smaller acquisitions, reflecting solid underlying business fundamentals and continued volume growth across all major markets. Adjusted EBITDA margins improved to 31.7% with storage and service gross margin improvement, reflecting benefits from both Transformation and Recall synergies. However, the integration of Recall continued to impact on profitability. Additionally, certain contract renegotiations impacted revenue in Western Europe. The company expects adjusted EBITDA to grow by 17.5% with adjusted EBITDA margins expanding about 200 basis points to around 33% for the full-year 2017. Furthermore, AFFO is expected to grow by 11.5% at the midpoint compared to 2016 supporting the company's dividend growth. The company also expects to invest about $160 million to $180 million in business acquisitions and acquisitions of customer relationships primarily building market share as they consolidate in their emerging markets. The guidance assumes they will invest about $20 million in operating costs associated with innovation initiatives and global shared services programs and also reflects the full-year impact of divestitures of legacy Iron Mountain businesses in Australia and Canada. Due to the rapid integration with Recall, it is difficult to isolate integration benefits from Transformation benefits, so the company will be reporting these benefits together through the improvement in overall adjusted EBITDA margins. The company has liquidity of nearly $1 billion at year-end and a lease adjusted debt ratio of 5.7 times, which was in line with expectations. 
Considering the challenges with the Recall integration and the impact of contract renegotiations on revenue, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for this company until there is more clarity on their ability to optimize the legacy Recall business and bring it in line with profitability levels, as well as on the performance of their shared service initiatives and innovation programs.
