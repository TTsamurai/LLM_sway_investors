Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is clear that the company has delivered a strong performance in 2016, with internal storage rental revenue growth of 2.9% and adjusted EBITDA margins improving to 31.7%. The integration of Recall has continued on track, with a $65 million annual run rate of net synergies towards the target of $80 million. The company's 2017 guidance includes the expectation of adjusted EBITDA to grow by 17.5%, with adjusted EBITDA margins expanding about 200 basis points to around 33%.

The company's focus on innovation initiatives and global shared services programs is expected to require an investment of about $20 million in operating costs, with $160 million to $180 million allocated to business acquisitions, primarily building market share in emerging markets. In addition, the company aims to optimize its real estate portfolio through capital recycling, funding purchases through selling non-strategic buildings and using the proceeds to purchase properties in more strategic locations.

The company's guidance for 2017 includes the expectation that cash available for distribution and investments will cover the anticipated full-year dividend, required capital expenditures, core growth racking, and a portion of discretionary investments, resulting in approximately $125 million of capital available after funding the dividend to support core growth racking and other discretionary value-creating investments. The company had liquidity of nearly $1 billion at year-end and a lease adjusted debt ratio of 5.7 times, in line with expectations.

In summary, the company's strong performance, focus on integration and transformation, and strategic investment plans support an 'overweight' investment stance for the future outlook. The company's solid financial metrics and expected growth in adjusted EBITDA and AFFO provide confidence in its ability to deliver on its projections for the year and create value for investors.
