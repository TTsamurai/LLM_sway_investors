Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. The company reported strong internal storage rental revenue growth and enhanced profitability due to successful integration of Recall and Transformation Initiative. However, there were changes in terminology and definitions that may affect transparency for investors. Additionally, there are challenges with Recall's lower margin profile and the impact of certain contract renegotiations on revenues. The company's guidance for 2017 includes extra costs associated with innovation initiatives and global shared services programs, which may impact the bottom line. Furthermore, the company's debt ratio and the need for external funding for investments suggest potential financial risk. Overall, there are several uncertainties and potential risks that warrant a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company's performance and future prospects for investment.
