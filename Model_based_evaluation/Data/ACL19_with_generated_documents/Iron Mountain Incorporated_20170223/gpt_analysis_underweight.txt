Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, here are the key insights and financial metrics that can support an 'underweight' investment stance for the company:

1. Terminology and definition changes: The company has made changes to certain terms and definitions, such as replacing 'adjusted OIBDA' with 'adjusted EBITDA,' and tweaking the future AFFO definition. While these changes may simplify reporting, they could also impact investor understanding and make historical comparisons more difficult.

2. Strong internal storage rental revenue growth: The company achieved strong internal storage rental revenue growth of 2.9%, reflecting solid underlying business fundamentals and continued volume growth across all major markets. However, there was a decline in service revenues due to decreases in transportation and handling activities as well as Western European service projects.

3. Integration of Recall: The integration of Recall continued on track, with a $65 million annual run rate of net synergies towards a target of $80 million to be realized in the year. However, the legacy Recall business had a lower margin profile compared to the company's base business, and efforts to bring it in line with profitability levels may impact overall profitability.

4. Adjusted EBITDA margins and gross profit margin: The company improved its adjusted EBITDA margins to 31.7% and continued to benefit from its Transformation Initiative and Recall synergies. However, gross margin declined due to the mix of Recall's lower margins, although overhead efficiencies more than offset this decline.

5. Financial performance by segment: The company highlighted the relative size of revenue contribution from each business segment, with storage providing more than 80% of the adjusted gross profit. While there were improvements in internal storage rental revenue growth in North America and Other International segments, there were declines in Western Europe.

6. Guidance for 2017: The company refined its guidance for 2017 due to negative currency impacts and finalizing back-office shared service initiatives and innovation-related plans. It expects adjusted EBITDA to grow by 17.5% with adjusted EBITDA margins expanding about 200 basis points to around 33%. However, the guidance also includes additional operating costs associated with innovation initiatives and global shared services programs, impacting the bottom line.

7. Capital allocation and investments: The company plans to optimize its real estate portfolio through capital recycling and invest in business acquisitions and acquisitions of customer relationships to build market share in emerging markets. Additionally, it expects to have approximately $125 million of capital available after funding the dividend to support core growth racking and other discretionary investments.

Based on these insights and financial metrics, an 'underweight' investment stance may be warranted due to potential challenges related to maintaining service revenues, integration of the legacy Recall business, and the impact of additional operating costs on the bottom line. Additionally, the changes in terminology and guidance refinement for 2017 may raise concerns about transparency and the company's ability to meet its financial projections.
