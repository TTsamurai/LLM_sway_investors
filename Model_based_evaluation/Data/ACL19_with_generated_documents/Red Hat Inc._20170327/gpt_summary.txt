as well, it's part of a modern application that is being used in the cloud. So I think the other thing to be aware is the element of our largest deals that have one or two pieces of our portfolio inside them is one of the things that makes it challenging to see how much of it is stand-alone because our largest deals. So in the longitudinal data, they are often running a lot of our portfolio together. And then, on the channel question, we feel really good about the balance of our business between channel and direct, I think our team has always known we had to work to add more direct relationships, particularly in the large enterprise segment and we're really pleased to see the shift. I think this is a good result and that is more than traditional channels, but this is actually just we've got a very deliberate model to go after things we're good at and larger enterprises really are our specialty. So we do a lot of what we do and we've been very conscious about that as we make those investments. So I think it bodes well for being really tightly aligned to the business of our customer. So that's positive all the way around. And a measure of strength in the customer relationships. And given that that's a focal area of growth for us, it couldn't be better, I think. So I would say overall, good market, good execution quarter, and I think our financial results are demonstrable of that. We exactly executed on the strategy that we detailed for you at prior quarters and that's been focused on delivering a strong bulk high-require that powered by longer term deals and that's what we exactly accomplished. Thank you, Keith. We will now open the floor for Q&A.
