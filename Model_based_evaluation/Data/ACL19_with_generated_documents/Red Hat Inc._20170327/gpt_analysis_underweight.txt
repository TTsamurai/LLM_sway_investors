Based on the information extracted from the company's recent earnings conference call, I would recommend adopting an 'underweight' investment stance. Despite the company's strong financial results in the last quarter and throughout the fiscal year 2017, there are several key insights and metrics that indicate potential risks for future performance.

1. High exposure to currency rate volatility: Although currency rate volatility stabilized to make many of the USD and constant currency growth rates equivalent in the last quarter, the company mentioned a significant impact from currency fluctuations, including a 2% headwind to full year FY18 revenue growth.

2. Shorter deal duration and linearity challenges: The company mentioned that its proxy for bookings duration increased to approximately 25 months, compared to the historic 21-month level. Moving forward, they expect duration to move closer to the historic duration, which could impact the growth rate of long-term deals. Additionally, linearity continues to be a focus, and the company faced challenges in addressing linearity in the last quarter due to clients' negotiation tactics.

3. Shift in quarterly business flow and timing lag on collections: The company highlighted a continued shift in the annual percentage of sales occurring in Q4, and this is reflected in their operating cash flow guidance for FY18. They also addressed the timing lag on collections and factored in the shift in their operating cash flow guidance, indicating potential future challenges in timely collection.

4. Higher level of shareholder returns and headcount growth: The company reported giving back $139 million to shareholders in the last quarter through stock repurchases and is planning to add approximately 1,000 net new associates, representing approximately 10% headcount growth compared to 19% in the previous fiscal year. This high-level return to shareholders and substantial headcount growth may indicate potential cash flow strain.

Considering these key insights and financial metrics, the company's exposure to currency volatility, changes in deal duration, linearity challenges, and high shareholder returns suggest potential risks in future financial performance. Therefore, I recommend adopting an 'underweight' investment stance for the company.
