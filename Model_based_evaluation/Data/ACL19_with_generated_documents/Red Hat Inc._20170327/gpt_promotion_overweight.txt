Based on the recent earnings call, Red Hat just announced total revenue of $629 million for the quarter, marking a growth of 16% in USD and constant currency, which is approximately $7 million above the high-end of their guidance. The subscription revenue continued to be the largest driver of their total revenue at $560 million for the quarter, which was an increase of 17% year-over-year. Moreover, their non-GAAP operating income grew 23% year-over-year, with non-GAAP operating margin at 24.3%, which was 30 basis points higher than guidance. Subscription revenue for the Infrastructure-related offerings was at $435 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year, while subscription revenue for their Application Development-related and other emerging technologies was $125 million, an increase of 40% year-over-year. Furthermore, Red Hat ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2.1 billion. They returned $139 million to shareholders in the quarter through the repurchase of approximately 1.9 million shares of stock, and their operating cash flow was $318 million for the quarter, an increase of 27% from the year-ago-quarter. Their total deferred revenue at quarter end was $2.1 billion, an increase of $347 million or 20% over the same quarter a year ago.

The total backlog was up 28% year-over-year for a record balance in excess of $2.7 billion in USD, with the portion of the backlog yet to be billed and not included in their balance sheet being in excess of $650 million -- a growth of nearly 60% compared to the previous year. Additionally, the backlog contributes to a significant portion of next year's revenue as well as giving forward visibility of revenue beyond FY18. The company also provided its outlook for FY18, forecasting full year revenue guidance to be $2.72 billion to $2.76 billion in US dollars, up approximately 14% at the high end of the range, and expects operating margin to expand by 50 basis points to approximately 23.6% in FY18. In summary, Red Hat's strong financial performance in the fourth quarter and their long-term growth opportunities in the hybrid cloud digital transformation and modernizing data centers with open source solutions make it an attractive prospect to consider an 'overweight' investment stance in light of their recent earnings report.
