Based on the recent earnings call, the company has made significant progress with their regulatory and operational developments, including a settlement agreement that has broad-based support and contains a number of benefits for customers, shareholders, and the communities they serve. 

The company is also investing more in their distribution systems, with a focus on modernizing the distribution grid. They expect to invest $1.8 billion in their grid infrastructure over the next few years, enabling a more secure and resilient grid with greater access to the Western Energy market. 

In addition, the company filed their 2017 integrated resource plan, which includes a 15-year forecast of customer electricity demands. They anticipate a growing requirement for flexible peaking generation and expect an additional 1.3 gigawatts of quick start combustion turbine capacity will be needed by 2025.

Furthermore, the company is positioning their generation investments to be more aligned with new market conditions, with a focus on flexible peaking technology and eventually energy storage. This shift in investment focus is expected to result in a lower cost of service for customers, improved reliability for the region, and new investment opportunities for the company. 

Lastly, there has been a change in the company's executive team, with the current general counsel transitioning into retirement, and a new executive vice president and general counsel appointed in his place.

Based on the strong progress in regulatory and operational developments, the strategic capital investments being made, and the changes to the executive team, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company.
