**Investment Outlook Report: Pinnacle West - "Overweight" Investment Stance**

**Executive Summary:**
Based on Pinnacle West's recent earnings conference call for the year 2017, we have adopted an 'overweight' investment stance. Key factors contributing to this recommendation include strategic regulatory settlements, strong operational performance, promising infrastructure investments, and aligning with favorable market conditions. The company's proactive adjustments in rate structures, coupled with significant capital investments in grid modernization and flexibility in generation capability, position it well for sustainable growth.

**Regulatory Environment and Settlements:**
Pinnacle West has successfully negotiated a comprehensive settlement that resulted in broad-based buy-in from various stakeholders, including the Arizona Corporation Commission staff and the solar industry. This settlement facilitates an $87.2 million annual increase in base rates, balanced by a reduction in rates due to decreased fuel costs and a tactical increase associated with depreciation schedules. Importantly, the settlement retains a 10% return on equity and implements key financial provisions that minimize regulatory lag - factors that enhance earnings predictability and attractiveness to investors.

**Operational Highlights:**
Operational excellence continues to be a trademark of Pinnacle West, as evidenced by the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station operating above its 100% capacity factor. Furthermore, the company's ongoing investments in selective catalytic reduction equipment and the Ocotillo Modernization project underscore its commitment to operational efficiency and environmental compliance.

**Strategic Infrastructure Investments:**
Pinnacle West plans to invest $1.8 billion in grid modernization over the next few years. This initiative aims to bolster grid security and resilience while enhancing the integration with the Western Energy market. The shift in focus towards more flexible and quick-start generation capabilities is particularly notable. By 2025, an additional 1.3 gigawatts of combustion turbine capacity is expected to be operational to meet peak demands and manage the intermittency challenges posed by solar resources.

**Market Conditions and Investment Strategy:**
The utility is positioned to exploit market dynamics characterized by lower average daily prices and heightened volatility during peak periods, largely due to excess solar energy supply. Pinnacle West is strategically channeling investments towards flexible resources that can leverage market fluctuations, resulting in cost reductions and improved service reliability. The anticipated expansion in energy storage and combustion turbines aligns with emerging needs and is expected to foster long-term growth.

**Leadership and Governance:**
The transition within Pinnacle Westâ€™s executive team, with Jeff Guldner stepping up as General Counsel, alongside existing responsibilities, ensures leadership continuity and strategic alignment. This transition is part of a broader commitment to robust succession planning and talent development.

**Conclusion:**
Given Pinnacle West's strategic regulatory engagement, robust operational performance, significant capital investment in critical infrastructure, and a forward-looking adaptation to market conditions, an 'overweight' stance is recommended. The company's ongoing initiatives are expected to yield sustainable growth, enhance shareholder value, and position it as a resilient leader in the utilities sector. Potential investors are advised to consider Pinnacle West for a potentially rewarding addition to their investment portfolios, keeping in view the outlined future growth and strategic positioning.

**Recommendations:**
1. Monitor the implementation progress of the rate structure modifications and the impacts of the strategic capital investments.
2. Keep a close eye on regulatory developments, particularly the outcomes of the general rate case applications.
3. Evaluate Pinnacle West's adaptive strategies in response to market conditions and technological advancements in energy storage and peak generation capabilities.
