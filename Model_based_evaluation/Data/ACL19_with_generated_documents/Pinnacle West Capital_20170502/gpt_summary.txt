. It's going to be the second quarter of 2018 that Ocotillo was placed in service. And unit 4 at Four Corners, it's our estimate that it jumps from '19 to '20 when we get that initial recovery of the --. I can't remember if there was another large asset that went in to backstop it, but generally when you go from kind of a full 1 to a little more than full 1, it's really coincidental with kind of the SSR increases. Thank you. And certainly, we are happy in the record setting there at Palo Verde in first quarter, very positive to see constant good performance there. So with regards to the rate filing, we're 6% roughly through the proceedings at this point. The proposed settlement, I think, is a strong indication of progress we are making in working towards a constructive regulatory environment. As far as the actual rate filing went, we certainly were pleased with the broad base support that we had ultimately achieved there. There was a lot of attention, obviously, with respect to the customer bill impacts. So we were appreciative of the fact that was recognized and supported pretty widely amongst intervenors. We are currently working though with the tax court with regards to Tuscon Electric Power. So there's a number of different factors involved. And we try to balance a couple of those. Our riders are generally have a cost element that looks at sort of offsets in terms of costs and generator whatnot. We have gotten a good -- we have a large number of MPC [ph] customers with 2 rate schedules, and there's a lot of sensitivity to those customers. And then with regard to the next -- the overall proceeding, the next steps are we expect the administrative law judge to issue a recommended order and then the commission will take an action there. And as we move forward in the process, there will be some customer workshops that will be announced at a later date. And so we'll be engaging policy and staff over the months to come prior to any final order on the matter. Is there any update on --. Yes. We're in past that is prepared to file the trade electing their trailer storage on those assets. And I believe, Leslie, you correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe it was filed on April 11. I can't say exactly on black solar. It is our intent that once those units are in place, and we're not at that point where that's a decision that we're making currently we're looking at what's the optimal model, be linear or radial. I mentioned that. Thanks. It's a good question with a new generation. Again, we intend to do that somewhere in 2020. If you'll recall, there's a 3-year stay. So we agreed to file generally somewhere after June 1 of 2019. As far as your point on the trade, that's a little bit of similar to what Gary asked there. We have some pretty strict test requirements, including that we have to have a genuine need to file. And that model is conservative of that. So we're not in a place to make that call right now. Leslie Beyer Vice President of Financial Planning and Treasurer  And from our April 2013 filing. So for our transmission grid, I think what you're getting at is, let me take a step back. Certainly, with what's going on with some of the other utilities in our region and then thinking about the community impact and our customer impact and thinking about the evolution of how solar is and how the pricing has shifted. And I believe, it's our view that we want to be highly in renewable. And so where that exactly ends up and how we end up on the [Multiple Speakers]. So we like the technology. We think it's a good fit for us moving forward. And it may be a substantial part of our long-term plan. Thank you. Yes, we should have some commentary and some of our thoughts on that in our 10-Q, which will be filed shortly. And then that's probably about as best as we're going to get until the investment --. We're out to have the investments tagged and what I would call a more clear manner. So our PRV --.jspxvalues that leads Gold Rush was the limits of even is so effective 12:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m., which was more dictated by other regions who would decide number of [indiscernible]. We're now moving to 3 p.m. to 8 p.m., which is more cost aligned with market conditions. A lot of the other changes were to move to -- outside the time used in that [indiscernible] [ph] be required in terms of time of use. This [indiscernible] be the technologies that required it and that was likely for more rate optionality at the customer point of use. We're working through that there and some of the other details that we've -- and we have a write a reputation or it is stakeholder's tail [ph]. So we're working through that. It's going to be in further clarifications. So basically, we are taking that base rate for 20 years and that's what's driving the headline growth is the appetite. And that's its -- we can do to the additional compression, supported RFI market, we've been filing that as a foregone straight capacity costs a little bit more as well. And deadlines of 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. to align with resources and really much adjust usage. Me and not to peak usuage but not putting to the word of the entry of the next generation and just to peak generation --. Either of us have generally broken out. Now as renewable criteria is like a --. And so -- this is what I think we're looking to align --. Think our long-term inclusions in the resources. So you have a lot of the long-term fact that you give to a subjective creation based for residental users still who has effectively under the tighter schedules. And it's that when a resident [ph] would be required to segment on the TOU [ph] and the Laplace [ph] access factors. Which would be an important focus of what we files (NYSE:WDI) [ph]. And I guess ultimately, that's really what the bigger picture is here. So some should be unable to commence those next year --. Thank you and Mary, we've been managing our operations well. And after 2014, the reliability performance has willy improved. So -- our prices that has materialized and the flexibility with and -- during the day and that we also believe those are there a lot to do to work [ph] with that place. And the second thing is our power supply with switcher, give us the opportunity to expand the added generation, so our power supply adjustment program is expanded, -- use that to fueling costs. Which historically, would not have been included in the rate process. And finally, the feature developments is we work around the storage part, the prices of our renewable are pex being forecast and there are some factors that enable us to move the need from those areas -- permissible to natural gas type resources what Rio Verde or Bridgeport [ph]. So those are the kinds of things that are really contributing to our improvement --. And then, the last thing is the expansion of the base load situation and the operations is what we're doing, I think it meets that need completely. And then finally, I think both our CEO and myself spoken of this in capital allocation address and that's things over operation capital productivity and frankly, probably in bad repetition that our customer services has even been more of operations section now, reflecting on our earlier discussions. We do expect a capital disconnect for just on with the slide part of the earnings if I turn out to be a trouble. And with that I thought at this time a field for any additional quick progress or cathartic growth at this time. Thank you all for joining us today.
