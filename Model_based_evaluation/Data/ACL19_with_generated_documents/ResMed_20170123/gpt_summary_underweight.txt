SUMMARY REPORT

ResMed announced their second-quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings in a recent conference call, with robust double-digit global revenue growth primarily driven by device sales and the launch of new mask technologies. The company highlighted the milestones achieved and key product launches during the quarter.

Key Financial Metrics:

- Revenue growth: Strong double-digit global revenue growth driven by device sales and the launch of new mask technologies.
- Non-GAAP net operating profit: Grew by 13% on a year-over-year basis in Q2, indicating healthy profitability.
- Diluted earnings per share (EPS): $0.73 on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting the financial performance of the company.

The company also shared regional highlights, with the Americas region experiencing double-digit revenue growth fueled by Software-as-a-Service revenue from Brightree and strong device sales. The EMEA and APAC regions also produced strong revenue growth, driven by Flow Generator sales and performance from combined Curative and ResMed China businesses. The company emphasized the steady ramp-up of new mask technologies, with positive feedback from patients, physicians, and homecare providers.

Furthermore, ResMed provided updates on its strategic growth initiatives, including the launch of new products and the integration of Brightree software functionality into the AirSolutions portfolio. The company highlighted its leadership in connected care, reaching a milestone of 1 billion nights of sleep data and focusing on developing algorithms to convert big data into actionable information for physicians, providers, and payers.

Despite the positive developments, the company faces challenges in the mask and accessory category, with a temporary decline in sales in the EMEA and APAC regions due to a few factors, including international licensing revenue from the comparable quarter and slower uptake of new masks in those regions. However, ResMed remains optimistic about the prospects for mask growth in the upcoming quarters.

In conclusion, ResMed continues to drive innovation and product launches to enhance its position in the market and achieve its long-term goal of improving lives. The company remains positive about the future growth potential, particularly with the launch of the ResMed AirMini and strong demand for new mask technologies.

As a financial analyst, the underweight investment stance is based on the company's potential challenges in the mask and accessory category in certain regions, as well as the need for sustained growth to meet and exceed industry standards. Further analysis is recommended to assess the impact of these challenges on the overall financial performance and outlook for ResMed.
