Based on the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, I would recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on ResMed. ResMed achieved solid double-digit global revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, led by sales from Brightree and continued strong growth in device platforms. The announcement of reaching a milestone with over 1 billion nights of sleep data in the cloud-based physician and provider solution called AirView indicates strong potential for the company's growth in the field of connected care and digital health.

Key financial metrics such as non-GAAP net operating profit and diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis also showed positive growth at 13% and $0.73 respectively. The company has balanced revenue growth and gross margin improvements, and continues to invest in both R&D and SG&A to maximize the success of multiple product launches across global markets.

In terms of regional highlights, the Americas region showed double-digit revenue growth, driven by Software-as-a-Service revenue from Brightree and device growth. The combined EMEA and APAC regions also produced strong growth, primarily driven by Flow Generator sales and outstanding performance from combined Curative and ResMed China businesses.

The company's launch of new mask technologies, the AirFit N20 nasal mask and the AirFit F20 full face mask, with new step change technology called Infinity Seal, has seen positive feedback from patients, physicians, and homecare providers, indicating strong potential for growth in the mask category in the future.

Additionally, ResMed's Software-as-a-Service revenue from Brightree continues to grow strongly in line with their acquisition model in the low-to-mid teens, with high levels of customer satisfaction and workflow efficiency gains.

Overall, ResMed's continued focus on innovation, brand leadership, and the expansion of its product offerings in the market indicates strong growth potential for the company. Therefore, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended based on the strong financial performance and the company's strategic growth initiatives for the future.
