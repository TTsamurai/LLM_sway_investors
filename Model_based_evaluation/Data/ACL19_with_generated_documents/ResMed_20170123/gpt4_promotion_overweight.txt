**Investment Analysis Report: ResMed Inc. (NYSE: RMD)** 

**Recommendation: Overweight**

**Summary:**

ResMed Inc. recently delivered a robust earnings release for Q2 FY2017, demonstrating formidable growth momentum across its diversified product portfolio and geographical presence. Notably, the company's strategic focus on digital health solutions and cloud-connected devices positions it uniquely within the competitive landscape, paving the way for continued expansion and market share gains. We recommend an overweight position in ResMed, anchored by the underlying strength in its earnings performance, innovative product launches, and cloud technology adoption which are expected to drive superior returns.

**Revenue Growth and Profitability:**

ResMed reported solid double-digit global revenue growth, led by significant contributions from the Brightree software platforms and strong growth across device offerings. The Americas region, a key market for ResMed, exhibited robust expansion notably in device and software-as-a-service (SaaS) revenue streams. SaaS revenues from Brightree demonstrate sustainable growth in the low-to-mid teens, a testament to ResMedâ€™s strategic acquisition and integration prowess. Operating profit grew by 13% on a year-over-year basis, showcasing effective cost management and operational efficiency.

**Innovative Product Pipeline:**

A critical aspect of ResMed's growth narrative is its prolific product innovation pipeline marked by the launch of the AirFit N20 and AirFit F20 masks, both featuring Infinity Seal technology, indicating significant advances in patient comfort and fit. Additionally, the FDA clearance for the ResMed AirMini, the world's leading travel-friendly CPAP device, underscores ResMed's leadership in sleep apnea innovation. Such product innovations not only enhance ResMed's competitive edge but also expand its market reach and customer base.

**Digital Health and Cloud Connectivity:**

A cornerstone of ResMed's strategy is its emphasis on digital health and cloud connectivity. The company proudly manages over 2 million 100% cloud-connected medical devices. ResMed's AirSolutions platform including AirView and myAir for patient engagement showcases over 1 billion nights of sleep data, enhancing patient care and adherence significantly. This digital prowess supports sticky customer engagement and offers substantial cross-selling opportunities, reinforcing long-term revenue streams.

**Global Expansion and Market Opportunities:**

ResMed continues to deepen its market penetration across EMEA and APAC regions, evidenced by notable growth in flow generator sales and strategic integrations, such as ResMed China. This geographic and product diversification mitigates risk and provides a broader landscape for growth. Moreover, the company's focus on areas like COPD and the nasal mask market with innovative ventilation solutions positions it well to capitalize on global health care trends.

**Financial Health:**

ResMed maintains a sound financial profile with prudent balance sheet management. The non-GAAP EPS of $0.73, amid growing financing costs, reflects strong underlying profitability and cash flow generation capabilities. The strategic investments in R&D and SG&A are well poised to fuel future innovations and market expansion activities, supporting the long-term investment thesis.

**Conclusion:**

Given ResMed's exemplary quarterly performance, strategic innovations in both product and digital realms, and robust market expansion strategies, we posit that the company is well-equipped to continue its trajectory of growth and market leadership. The compelling combination of revenue diversification, operational excellence, and innovation-driven portfolio augments the investment appeal of ResMed, validating an overweight stance for discerning investors aiming for long-term capital appreciation and robust earnings visibility.
