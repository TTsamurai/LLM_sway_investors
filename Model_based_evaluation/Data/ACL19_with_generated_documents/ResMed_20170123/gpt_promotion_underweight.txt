Based on the recent earnings call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, the company's revenue growth has been strong, especially in the Americas region, driven by Software-as-a-Service revenue from Brightree as well as growth in devices. The company has also achieved positive growth in the combined EMEA and APAC regions, primarily driven by Flow Generator sales, with good performance from the combined Curative and ResMed China businesses. Additionally, the company has made significant advances in the development of new mask technologies with the launch of the AirFit N20 nasal mask and the AirFit F20 full face mask, both of which leverage new technology called Infinity Seal.

The company has also achieved strong growth in its Software-as-a-Service revenue, particularly with Brightree, and is working on integrating Brightree software functionality into the AirSolutions portfolio.

In addition, the company has made progress against each of the three horizons in its 2020 growth strategy, including the launch of new products such as the ResMed AirMini, the smallest, travel-friendly CPAP technology.

The company's management expressed confidence in its growth strategy, emphasizing the strong demand for the new mask technologies and the positive impact of the AirSolutions platform on revenue growth.

However, as a stock promoter, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance based on the cautious or skeptical perspective on the company. While the company has shown strong revenue growth and innovative product launches, there are concerns about the gradual ramp of new products in EMEA and APAC, slow uptake of new masks compared to the U.S., and the need for the company to balance revenue growth and gross margin improvements with appropriate investment in R&D and SG&A.

Overall, while the company's recent earnings call highlights its achievements and growth strategies, there are factors that warrant a cautious approach to investment in the company at this time.
