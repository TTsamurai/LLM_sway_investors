Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take a cautious or skeptical stance on the company and recommend an 'underweight' investment stance. The company's sales are primarily driven by acquisitions, with organic sales showing a decline. The Project Booster is expected to be neutral to operating profit and cash flow in 2017, with costs associated with the project impacting earnings per share. The guidance for return to organic growth in the second half of the year is uncertain, and the expectation for cost savings and cash flow improvements from Project Booster may not materialize until 2019. Additionally, the company's tax rate and cash taxes have been noted to vary from year to year and may not be a reliable indicator of cash flow. Therefore, it is important to approach an investment in this company with caution and be aware of the potential risks to returns.
