. So, analyzing the key financial metrics from the earnings call, here is a summary of the important points:

1. Revenue: The company has added approximately $1.6 billion of revenue over the past five years. Sales increased 13% over the last year, with $210 million of acquisition contributions. The company expects organic sales to decline by approximately 2% in the second quarter, with the aim of returning to organic sales growth in the second half of the year.

2. Operating Profit and Margins: The company has doubled its operating profit and expanded margins by over 500 basis points over the past five years. Overall, the company reported a 3% increase in operating margins, but a $7 million expense related to Project Booster dragged the core operating margins down by 50 basis points. However, the company expects operating margins to be flattish in the second quarter.

3. Cash Flow: Cash flow from operations improved by $262 million over the prior year, with approximately half of the improvement being timing related, and the other half coming from structural improvements to working capital. The company also expects to see $300 million of incremental cash flow from operations by the end of 2019 due to Project Booster.

4. Cost Savings and Investments: The company expects to achieve $100 million of net cost savings annually and $300 million of incremental cash flow from operations by the end of 2019 through Project Booster. These savings are expected to be on top of the annual $30 million to $40 million supply chain efficiency gains and remaining synergies from prior acquisitions.

5. Tax Rate and EPS: The tax rate was 6% in the quarter, in line with the full-year guidance. EPS of $0.29 was at the high-end of guidance range despite the $0.02 per share impact from Booster-related expenses. The company did not provide specific guidance on gross profit margin but expects to continue seeing improvement in the future.

6. Shareholder Returns: The company returned over $350 million to shareholders and invested approximately $300 million during the quarter to repurchase nearly 15 million shares.

In conclusion, the company has shown strong financial performance over the past five years, and with the implementation of Project Booster, it aims to continue its growth and achieve significant cost savings and incremental cash flow from operations by the end of 2019.
