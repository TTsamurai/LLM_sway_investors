Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript for the company, it is clear that the company has experienced a significant transformation over the past five years. Revenue has increased by $1.6 billion, with a third of sales now coming from international business. Operating profit has more than doubled, and margins have expanded by over 500 basis points. Additionally, the company has completed $2.3 billion in acquisitions and returned roughly $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.

The company has also launched Project Booster, which is expected to fully leverage their global footprint and unlock the full revenue and cash flow potential of their business model. This initiative is expected to be neutral to operating profit and cash flow in 2017, incurring approximately $7 million of costs in the first quarter primarily from head count-related actions. Equivalent levels of expense are expected in Q2, with costs being reflected in adjusted results. However, savings from these actions are expected to fully offset the first half costs and flow through in the third and fourth quarters. Over the next two years, gross cost savings and working capital improvements, as well as growth-related investments, are expected to reach $100 million of net cost savings and $300 million of incremental cash flow from operations by the end of 2019.

Despite a 13% increase in revenue, organic sales declined 4% versus the previous year. However, there were encouraging signs within the quarter, especially in online sales, men's underwear, Activewear, and the Asia business, which showed organic growth. Gross margin improved 230 basis points over last year to 40.2%, driven by acquisition-related mix and efficiency gains within the supply chain.

Looking at guidance, the company reiterates its full-year outlook and provided second-quarter guidance, which includes approximately $200 million from acquisition contributions, implying an organic sales decline of roughly 2%. The company also expects return to organic sales growth in the second half of the year.

Based on this analysis, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. While the company has shown strong financial results and implemented cost-saving initiatives, the decline in organic sales and a cautious outlook for the second quarter indicate potential challenges in the near term. The impact of Project Booster on operating profit and cash flow in 2017, as well as the expected costs and savings over the next two years, suggests a period of adjustment and uncertainty. Therefore, it may be prudent to approach investment in the company cautiously until the impact of these initiatives becomes clearer.
