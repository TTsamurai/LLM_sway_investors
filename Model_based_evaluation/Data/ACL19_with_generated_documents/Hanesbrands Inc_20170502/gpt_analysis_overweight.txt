Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript for the company, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance. The company has seen significant growth over the past five years, with added revenue, expanded global footprint, doubled operating profit, and expanded margins. The implementation of Project Booster is expected to further leverage the company's global footprint and unlock additional revenue and cash flow potential.

The impact and cadence of Project Booster is expected to be neutral to operating profit and cash flow in 2017, with costs factored into current guidance. However, cost savings, working capital improvements, and growth-related investments from Project Booster are projected to reach $100 million of net cost savings and $300 million of incremental cash flow from operations by the end of 2019.

Key insights from the earnings conference call include a strong start to the year with a 13% increase in sales, improving trend for organic sales growth, and strong improvements in cash flow with over $350 million returned to shareholders.

Additionally, the company expects to see improvements in gross margin quarter-after-quarter and year-over-year, as well as incremental gross margin improvement after wrapping up acquisitions.

Overall, the company's strategic initiatives and projected earnings growth provide a positive outlook for future performance, supporting an 'overweight' investment stance.
