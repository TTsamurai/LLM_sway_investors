Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. While the company has shown significant improvements in revenue and operating profit over the past five years through the implementation of the Sell More, Spend Less, Generate Cash strategy, the upcoming Project Booster is expected to be neutral to operating profit and cash flow in 2017, with costs of approximately $7 million in the first quarter and an equivalent level in the second quarter.

Furthermore, the company expects $100 million of net cost savings and $300 million of incremental cash flow from operations by the end of 2019, but the impact and cadence from Booster are not expected to fully offset the costs until the third and fourth quarters of this year. Additionally, the company's organic sales declined by 4% versus last year, despite some encouraging signs of improvement in certain segments such as online sales, men's underwear, activewear, and the Asia business.

Although gross margin improved by 230 basis points over last year to 40.2% due to acquisition-related mix and efficiency gains in the supply chain, the operating margin declined by 50 basis points over last year, largely due to the costs related to Project Booster. The company's guidance for the second quarter also includes approximately $8 million of Booster-related expense, which is expected to fall primarily in SG&A.

In summary, while the company has shown growth in revenue and earnings per share, the costs associated with Project Booster, along with the decline in organic sales, raise concerns about the company's near-term profitability. Additionally, the cash flow improvements and cost savings from Project Booster are not expected to fully offset the costs until the third and fourth quarters of this year. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended for the company based on the analysis of key financial metrics from the recent earnings conference call transcript.
