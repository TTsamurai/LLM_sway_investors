   - Additional projects worth over $1 billion are expected to be added to the backlog once permitting requirements are complete.

3. **Segment Performance**:

5. **Financial Guidance**: 
   - Growth is projected for both the Electric Power and Oil and Gas segments over the next 12 months.
   - The company maintains a cautious yet optimistic guidance approach, reflecting possible outcomes and inherent business risks.

6. **Market Outlook**:
   - Potential regulatory reforms by the new U.S. administration might ease permitting processes, indirectly benefiting Quanta's project timelines and backlog.
   - Robust bidding environment anticipated for infrastructure projects, notwithstanding a degree of unpredictability in regulatory and permitting stages.

#### Challenges and Risks:
- Economic conditions in Canada have been challenging, affecting both Electric Power and Oil and Gas operations, although signs of recovery are emerging.
- Quanta faces normal business risks including project timing, regulatory changes, and market demand fluctuations. Current geopolitical situations such as the evolving policies of the new U.S. administration may also impact operational scopes.

#### Conclusion and Strategic Focus:
Quanta Services demonstrates a strong operational performance and strategic positioning at the end of 2016, supported by a substantial project backlog and optimistic revenue forecasts for 2017. The company's leadership in providing comprehensive infrastructure solutions continues to bolster its market stance, with strategic expansions planned in telecom and continuous enhancement of its core Electric Power and Oil and Gas services. Fiscal prudence and adaptive business strategies are emphasized to navigate potential market and regulatory volatilities.
