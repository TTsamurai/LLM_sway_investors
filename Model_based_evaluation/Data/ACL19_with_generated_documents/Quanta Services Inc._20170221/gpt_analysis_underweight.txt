Based on the key insights and financial metrics derived from Quanta Services' recent earnings conference call transcript, here are the reasons to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company:

1. Revenue and Profitability Momentum: While Quanta Services reported significant revenue and profitability momentum in the second half of 2016, the company's management emphasized that they are not satisfied and remain committed to returning operating margins to historical levels. This suggests that the company may still face challenges in achieving sustained growth and profitability.

2. Backlog and Project Awards: Quanta Services highlighted a record 12-month backlog and large projects with ongoing permitting requirements and aggregate contract values well in excess of $1 billion. However, the uncertainty around final contract terms and construction start dates suggests potential delays and risks in realizing revenue from these projects.

3. Macroeconomic Challenges: The company acknowledged the challenging macro environment in Canada for both its Electric Power and Oil and Gas operations. Despite signs of recovery, the management expressed caution about the overall economy in Canada, which could impact the company's performance.

4. Regulatory Reform and Permitting Delays: Quanta Services indicated that the potential positive impact of regulatory reform and easing of permitting and approval processes could benefit its business. However, concerns were raised about the delays and challenges involved in regulatory processes for larger projects, particularly in the pipeline segment.

5. Market Opportunities and Margins: While Quanta Services highlighted market opportunities in the Electric Power and Oil and Gas segments, there was caution expressed about project timing, margin pressures, and the need for cautious guidance due to the uncertainty of market and regulatory dynamics.

In summary, the company's outlook presents a mixed picture of opportunities and challenges, with uncertainties around project execution, regulatory environment, and macroeconomic conditions. These factors suggest a level of risk and caution that aligns with an 'underweight' investment stance for Quanta Services.
