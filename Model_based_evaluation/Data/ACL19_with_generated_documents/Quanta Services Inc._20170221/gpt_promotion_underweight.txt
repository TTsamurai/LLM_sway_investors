Based on the information provided in the earnings call, it is clear that Quanta Services has had some challenges and uncertainties in the Canadian market, as well as in the pipeline projects. The cautious approach expressed by the company's CFO, Derrick Jensen, reflects the need for careful consideration and management of expectations for the future. The CFO's emphasis on caution in guiding the forecasts for the back half of 2017 and the potential impact of permitting delays highlight the need for a skeptical perspective on the company's future performance. Additionally, the company's cautious approach to the telecom infrastructure market, despite its optimism, raises concerns about the potential growth in this segment.

Therefore, based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on Quanta Services until there is more clarity and certainty regarding the company's ability to overcome the challenges and deliver consistent growth in its operations. The uncertainties and caution expressed by the company's management regarding the Canadian market, pipeline projects, and telecom expansion strategy suggest a need for a skeptical approach to investment in Quanta Services at this time.
