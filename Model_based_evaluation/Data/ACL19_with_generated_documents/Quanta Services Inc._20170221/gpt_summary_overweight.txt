. Thank you for your participation in Quanta Services' fourth quarter and yearend 2016 earnings conference call. The transcript provides valuable insights into the company's operations and strategic outlook for the future. As a financial analyst, I have carefully analyzed the key financial metrics and strategic updates provided in the call.

Overall, Quanta Services' performance in the fourth quarter and the momentum experienced in the second half of 2016 are indicators of solid operating performance. The company is committed to returning its operating margins to historical levels and has demonstrated progress towards this goal. Additionally, Quanta ended the quarter with a record 12-month backlog and is confident in its ability to capitalize on ongoing and potential projects.

Electric Power segment revenues remained comparable to the previous year, but operating income and margins showed significant improvement. Quanta has a positive long-term outlook for this segment, driven by the need to maintain and replace aging infrastructure, shift to more renewables and natural gas, and regulation aimed at improving grid reliability.

The Oil and Gas segment also saw strong revenues and substantial increases in operating income and margins in the fourth quarter. The company is optimistic about the potential for larger pipeline projects in 2018 and beyond, particularly in Canada and the Lower 48. Quanta's established pipeline operating units are well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities.

The company is cautious about the Canadian market due to economic challenges but remains optimistic about the potential for growth in the U.S. telecom infrastructure services market now that the non-compete arrangement has expired.

Quanta Services' prudent approach to revenue and margin range expectations in its guidance reflects the inherent risks in its business. The company is focused on strategically positioning itself for profitable long-term growth and continues to have a positive multiyear view of the end markets it serves.

In summary, the company's operational and strategic updates in the conference call support an 'overweight' investment stance, with a focus on the promising outlook for the Electric Power and Oil and Gas segments. Quanta Services' unique operating model, entrepreneurial mindset, and strong leadership position in the industry provide a solid foundation for long-term value generation for stakeholders.
