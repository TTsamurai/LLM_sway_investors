Based on the earnings conference call transcript, there are a few key financial metrics that indicate a cautious stance on investing in Quanta Services. Here are the main points from the call:

1. Electric Power Segment: While the segment's revenues were comparable to the previous year, there was a solid improvement in operating income and margins. The company expects larger transmission project revenues to increase in 2017 compared to 2016, and even more so in 2018. This indicates a positive outlook for the Electric Power segment.

2. Oil and Gas Segment: Revenues were strong, and operating income and margins increased substantially in the fourth quarter. The company is optimistic about the larger pipeline project opportunities in North America, especially in Canada. There is potential for growth in the next three to five years.

3. Telecom Infrastructure Services: The company has resumed activity in the U.S. telecom infrastructure services market and expects significant long-term growth opportunities. Latin American and Canadian operations in this sector have been successful.

4. Canadian Market: The company is cautious about the overall economic situation in Canada and how it might impact margin capabilities. There is concern about the delay in larger pipeline projects due to permitting issues.

Given these insights, it is advisable to adopt an 'underweight' stance on investing in Quanta Services at this time. While there are optimistic indicators in the Electric Power and Oil and Gas segments, there are potential risks associated with the Canadian market and the delays in larger pipeline projects. It is crucial to monitor the company's performance and market dynamics closely before considering a more confident investment stance.
