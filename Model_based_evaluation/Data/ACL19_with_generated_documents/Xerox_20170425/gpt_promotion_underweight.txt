Based on the company's recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. The company's revenue was down, and there were challenges in various segments of the business. The impact of the Fuji Xerox receivable write-off as well as the negative transaction currency impact are also reasons for concern. Furthermore, the company is expecting higher declines in Q2 and will not fully benefit from the new product launch. Overall, there are several headwinds facing the company that contribute to a cautious perspective on their performance.
