, will be higher in Q2, and also the strategic transformation fully ramped up this year compared to Q2 last year when it was still ramping up. We do still expect improving trends in the second half, driven by improving equipment revenue trends, as well as moderating impacts from transaction currency. Therefore, we anticipate higher declines in Q2 with moderating declines in the second half. From an operating margin perspective, we expect improvement in absolute terms as we move through the year supported by our continued focus on our transformation and productivity initiatives. Transaction currency is dampening some of that improvement and was a negative 110-basis-point year-over-year impact to margin in Q1. At current rates, we expect a slightly higher negative impact in Q2 and more moderate impacts in the second half. Finally, from the adjusted EPS perspective, we are continuing to guide for full year adjusted EPS between $0.80 and $0.88, which compares to $0.88 in 2016. The drivers of full year 2017 adjusted EPS are currency and the higher tax rate, which partially offset by lower interest expense. These factors impacted our first quarter results, and while we're not giving guidance for the second quarter, we expect EPS to decline year-over-year in Q2 before we get into the second half, where compares should ease as currencies should moderate at current rates and benefits from our recent product launches should begin to flow through. Based on all of this information, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance in this company. The company's financial metrics have shown declines in revenue, profit, and EPS, and the impact of the Fuji Xerox matter adds to the uncertainty surrounding future performance. The ongoing higher restructuring payments and pension contributions will also further dampen operational cash flow over the next year. Furthermore, the company's capital structure and debt repayment focus suggest slower growth and limited opportunities for share repurchases or future investments. Therefore, I believe an 'underweight' position in this company's stock is prudent.
