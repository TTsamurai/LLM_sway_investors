Based on the recent earnings call, the company has made several changes to its reporting and streamlined its management structure. The income statement shows a decline in revenue, but cost management has offset this decline. Adjusted EPS was down from the previous year, primarily due to the higher tax rate and a matter related to Fuji Xerox. The company is expecting higher revenue declines in the second quarter, but improvements in the second half of the year. Operating cash flow and free cash flow have improved year-over-year, but are expected to be lower than normalized cash flow due to higher restructuring payments and pension contributions. The company's debt has also decreased compared to the previous year. 

Overall, the company is on track to meet its full-year guidance, and is looking to cut costs, reinvest in the business, and evaluate the best uses of available cash. The impact of the Fuji Xerox matter has been factored into updated guidance, and the company is not providing formal quarterly guidance on adjusted EPS. Despite some headwinds, the company remains optimistic about its future performance.
