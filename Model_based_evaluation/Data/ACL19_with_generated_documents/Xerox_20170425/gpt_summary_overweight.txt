. The speaker discussed various financial metrics during the earnings conference call, including revenue, gross margins, operating income, equity income, tax rate, adjusted EPS, and cash flow. Revenue was down 6.2% in actual currency, or 4.3% at constant currency. Gross margins expanded by 20 basis points, and SAG as a percentage of revenue improved by 20 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $0.15, down $0.03 from Q1 2016, largely driven by the higher tax rate and the Fuji Xerox matter. Operating cash flow generation from continuing operations was $190 million, up $103 million year-over-year, and free cash flow was $164 million, up $109 million year-over-year. The company expects full-year adjusted EPS between $0.80 and $0.88. Additional key financial metrics discussed in the call included geographical revenue breakdown, equipment sales, post-sale revenue, strategic growth areas, signings, and the strategic transformation program. The company is expecting seasonally improved operating margins as they move through the year, but with headwinds related to revenue declines and currency fluctuations. The company is also focused on reducing costs in certain G&A sectors and reinvesting savings in the business, such as selling more A4s as part of their new product launch and investing in systems and back-office IT infrastructure to enhance efficiency. The impact of the Fuji Xerox matter on adjusted EPS was discussed, with a $30 million charge representing a $0.03 impact. The company is also factoring in larger headwinds in Q2 from a transaction currency perspective and not fully benefiting from all new products being out in Q2.
