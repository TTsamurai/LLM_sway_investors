Based on the recent earnings call, it is noted that the company reported a 7% growth in sales excluding currency and a 4% organic growth. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 18%. However, there are several reasons to take a cautious or skeptical stance on the company's performance.

Firstly, the company reported a negative free cash flow of $22 million, although this is an improvement from the previous year, it raises concerns about the company's ability to generate cash. Additionally, the increase in capital spend to support growth may further strain free cash flow.

The company's share count increased by roughly 600,000 shares in the quarter, which may dilute the value for existing shareholders. Furthermore, the impact of the tax accounting change and restructuring charges on EPS is projected to be approximately $0.30 for the full year, which is an increase from previous assumptions.

The operating margin of the Label and Graphic Materials segment remained unchanged at 12.7%, despite higher volume and productivity benefits being offset by unfavorable product mix and higher employee-related costs. The Industrial and Healthcare Materials segment also reported a decline in operating margin due to a sales decline in healthcare categories.

While the company has raised the midpoint of guidance for adjusted earnings per share, there are concerns about the impact of currency translation reducing net sales and pretax earnings. The increase in average shares outstanding, assuming dilution, also raises concerns about the company's ability to maintain earnings growth.

Overall, the cautious or skeptical perspective on the company's recent earnings call suggests an 'underweight' investment stance, as there are potential risks and challenges that may impact the company's future performance and shareholder value.
