Based on the recent earnings call, the company has seen strong performance in bookings, organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin improvement, and adjusted earnings per share growth. They have also made significant investments in business innovation and operational excellence. However, they have experienced material inflation and expect a negative spread between price and material inflation in the second quarter. It is also noted that their recent restructuring may result in a $0.15 per share total restructuring expense for full-year 2017.

Considering the company's expectations for negative price-to-material-inflation gap, potential currency headwinds, and the ongoing restructuring expenses, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. The caution is recommended due to the potential impact of these factors on the company's financial performance and earnings per share.
