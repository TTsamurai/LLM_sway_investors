As a stock promoter, I am recommending an 'underweight' investment stance based on Garmin's recent earnings call. While the company reported third quarter consolidated revenue of $743 million, which is up 3% over the prior year, there are several reasons for caution and skepticism.

First, the outdoor, aviation, marine, and fitness segments collectively increased 9% year-over-year and contributed 75% of total revenues. However, the decline in fitness revenue by 12% due to maturing market and product introduction timing, and the steep decline in basic activity trackers, is a cause for concern.

Additionally, while the aviation segment reported strong revenue growth of 16%, the aftermarket categories saw growth due to the ADS-B mandate and other equipment upgrades, which might not continue into 2018 and 2019.

The marine segment is expected to have minimal impact on Q4 according to the company's projections, and the auto segment is facing ongoing PND market contraction.

Furthermore, while the company is projecting a full year revenue increase of about 2% over 2016, the outlook for fitness has been reduced slightly, and the decline in basic trackers has impacted overall results.

The company also mentioned that there is a rapid decline in the basic activity tracker market, and the timing of product introductions has impacted both the outdoor and fitness segments.

In conclusion, while there are some pockets of growth in certain segments, the overall decline in fitness revenue, the ongoing PND market contraction, and the possibility of ADS-B growth not continuing in the future are reasons to be cautious about investing in Garmin. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended.
