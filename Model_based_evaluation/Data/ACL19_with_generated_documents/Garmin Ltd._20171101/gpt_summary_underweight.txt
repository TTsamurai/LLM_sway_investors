Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, we maintain an 'underweight' investment stance on Garmin due to the following key financial metrics:

1. Revenue: The overall consolidated revenue in the third quarter increased by 3% over the prior year, driven by growth in outdoor, aviation, marine, and fitness segments. However, the fitness segment experienced a decline in revenue.

2. Gross Margin: The gross margin improved to 58.4%, reflecting positive performance across the segments. However, operating margins declined in the fitness segment.

3. EPS: GAAP EPS was $0.78, and pro forma EPS was $0.75 in the quarter.

4. Segment Performance: The outdoor segment experienced strong growth, while the aviation segment reported strong revenue growth driven by OEM and aftermarket categories. The marine segment saw revenue growth, with Garmin completing the acquisition of Navionics. The fitness segment experienced a decline in revenue due to the maturing market for basic activity trackers.

5. Outlook: Garmin updated its projected revenue for the year to $3.07 billion, projecting an increase of about 2% over 2016. Pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.90.

6. Strategic Focus: Garmin remains focused on the wearable opportunity and expanding into new product categories, such as the introduction of Descent for the dive market and the Impact bat sensor for the baseball market.

Based on the financial performance and outlook, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on Garmin due to the declining performance in the fitness segment and the challenges in the basic activity tracker market. Additionally, the decline in revenue and operating margins in the fitness segment could impact the overall financial performance of the company.
