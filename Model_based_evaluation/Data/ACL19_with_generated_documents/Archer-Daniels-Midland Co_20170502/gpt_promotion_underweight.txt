Based on the recent earnings call, it is clear that the company is facing some challenges and uncertainties. The adjustment to the effective tax rate and the slight increase is a cause for concern, as it could impact the company's future earnings. Additionally, the minimal improvement in the ROIC, despite challenging operating conditions in the past, raises doubts about the company's ability to generate strong returns for shareholders.

The increased net interest expense and unallocated corporate costs are eating into the company's profits, and the higher capital spending for acquisitions could indicate a lack of discipline in managing expenses. The increasing debt levels and the slight decrease in shareholders' equity also signal potential financial strain on the company.

Additionally, while some business segments are expected to improve in 2017, the company's overall performance is still not projected to reach the levels of previous years. The comments from the management about long-term cost of capital and the need for significant investments in IT, innovation, and business transformation raise concerns about the company's ability to generate strong earnings in the future.

Considering these factors, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company, as there are uncertainties and potential risks that could impact the company's financial performance in the future.
