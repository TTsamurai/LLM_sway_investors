Based on the conference call transcript, the company's performance in 2016 showed progress in terms of strategic plans and business model strengthening. Key financial metrics mentioned include EBIT margin expansion, full year EPS growth of 7%, and solid operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion. However, it's important to note some concerns.

The retail takeaway and market share performance of the core U.S. business improved in the second half of the year, with snacking market share growth of about 10 basis points. Chocolate market share showed improvement, but non-chocolate candy performance needs improvement. The international markets, particularly in Mexico, Brazil, and India, showed solid growth, but China's modern trade environment continues to present challenges. 

The company's strategic review of global cost structure is expected to result in solid margin expansion and EPS growth, which should be monitored closely. It's worth noting that the new CEO will be taking over on March 1, which may bring changes to the company's future plans and strategies. Additionally, there are IT investments being made at the business and corporate level that aim to enhance efficiency, which may have an impact on financial performance.

Considering the information provided, an 'underweight' investment stance is advisable until further clarity is achieved on the impact of the strategic review on cost structure, the new CEO's plans, and the effectiveness of IT investments. These factors could potentially affect the company's financial performance and growth prospects. The company's progress in the second half of 2016 is positive, but it's essential to closely monitor the developments in the coming quarters before making an investment decision.
