Based on the recent earnings call, the company seems to have made progress against their strategic plans, with a focus on cost savings initiatives and margin expansion. However, there are some concerns regarding non-chocolate candy performance, particularly for the Brookside brand. Additionally, while international markets such as Mexico, Brazil, and India showed growth, the China market saw a decline in net sales. The company also mentioned a strategic review of their global cost structure, which could result in margin expansion and EPS growth, but the details of these plans were not provided. Additionally, there was a mention of investments in IT to improve efficiency, but again, specifics were lacking. Overall, while the company has shown progress in certain areas, there are still uncertainties and lack of concrete details in their plans for future growth and cost savings, which may result in a cautious stance on investing in the company. Therefore, at this time, an 'underweight' investment stance might be recommended due to the lack of clarity and uncertainties in their future plans.
