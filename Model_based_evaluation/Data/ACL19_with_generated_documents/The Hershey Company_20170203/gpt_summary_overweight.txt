Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that The Hershey Company has made progress against its strategic plans and has positioned the company for future growth. Key financial metrics include:

1. Full year EPS growth of 7%: The company exceeded its forecast for operating income and earnings per share, driven by cost savings efficiencies and a lower-than-expected tax rate.

2. Solid operating cash flow of about $1 billion in 2016: This gives the company financial flexibility and the ability to invest in growth opportunities.

3. U.S. market share growth of 10 basis points in the snacking category: The company saw improved marketplace performance and retail takeaway, particularly in the chocolate segment, leading to market share gains.

4. International market performance: The company experienced solid constant currency net sales growth in Mexico, Brazil, India, and China, with strong performances in key product categories such as chocolate and confectionery.
