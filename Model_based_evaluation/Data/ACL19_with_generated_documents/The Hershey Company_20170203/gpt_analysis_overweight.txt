Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, Hershey's strategic plans have shown progress and have positioned the company for future growth. The company's productivity and cost savings initiatives have driven EBIT margin expansion and EPS growth, with solid operating cash flow of about $1 billion in 2016, providing financial flexibility.

Marketplace performance, particularly in the U.S., has progressed as anticipated, with retail takeaway and market share showing improvement in the second half of the year. The company has achieved snacking market share growth of 10 basis points and has seen solid performance in its U.S. chocolate segment, resulting in market share gains.

Key brands such as Reese's and Kit Kat have gained momentum and performed well, with plans for innovation and variety to continue driving growth. Additionally, the company has identified opportunities in the non-chocolate candy segment and is working on improving trends for the Brookside brand.

In international markets, Hershey has seen growth in Mexico, Brazil, and India, with successful product launches and distribution gains. However, the modern trade hypermarket environment in China remains challenging, although the company's e-commerce business is progressing.

Furthermore, Hershey's future outlook includes strategic IT investments, market changes, and solutions for retailers to adapt to changing consumer behavior. The company plans to provide more details on these initiatives at their investor update on March 1.

Based on these key insights and financial metrics, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for Hershey. The company's progress in strategic plans, solid financial performance, and potential for future growth in both domestic and international markets support a positive outlook for investors.
