Key Financial Metrics:

1. EBIT Margin Expansion: The company saw EBIT margin expansion in 2016, contributing to full year EPS growth of 7%.

2. Operating Cash Flow: The company generated approximately $1 billion in operating cash flow in 2016, providing financial flexibility.

3. Net Sales and Retail Takeaway: Fourth quarter net sales and retail takeaway were in line with expectations, with U.S. marketplace performance sequentially improving.

4. Market Share Growth: The company experienced solid market share growth in the snacking category, particularly in the U.S. chocolate segment.

5. International Markets: The company saw solid net sales growth in international markets, particularly in Mexico, Brazil, and India. However, net sales in China declined, driven by a challenging hypermarket environment.

6. Leadership Transition: The company announced a new CEO, Michele Buck, who will take over on March 1. The current Chairman and CEO expressed confidence in her capabilities.

These key financial metrics indicate a mix of positive and challenging performance across different market segments and regions. The company's strategic initiatives and cost savings efforts have contributed to margin expansion and EPS growth. However, performance in non-chocolate candy and in certain international markets presents areas of opportunity for improvement. The upcoming investor update on March 1 is expected to provide more detailed information on the company's plans for addressing these challenges and capitalizing on growth opportunities.
