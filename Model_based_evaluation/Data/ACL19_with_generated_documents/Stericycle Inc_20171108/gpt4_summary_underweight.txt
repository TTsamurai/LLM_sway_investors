### Investment Summary: Underweight Recommendation

#### Company: Stericycle

#### Ticker: Not specified

#### Sector: Waste Management and Compliance Services

### Key Financial Metrics & Analysis:

1. **Revenue Analysis:**
   - Global revenues dropped by 0.8% YOY to $882.8 million.
   - Organic revenue growth was only 0.2% after adjustments, showing minimal growth independent of external factors like foreign exchange and acquisitions/divestitures.
   - The decrease in international revenue by 2.2% and the decline in adjusted domestic revenue by 0.2% highlight weakness across significant segments.
   - Revenue was adversely affected by the challenges in manufacturing and industrial services and the loss of certain contracts.

2. **Profitability:**
   - Gross profit margin was fairly consistent at 41.7% but income from operations (EBITDA) at 19.9% of revenues reflects potential inefficiencies or increased operating costs.
   - Net income attributable to Stericycle was significantly lower than adjusted figures due to acquisition-related expenses and other adjustments, raising questions about the sustainability of reported profits.

3. **Cost Structure:**
   - SG&A costs, standing at 21.8% of revenues, suggest a high cost of managing operations.
   - The merger and acquisition costs, along with the challenges from natural disasters, indicate potential recurring costs that could impact profitability.

4. **Debt and Liquidity:**
   - The debt to EBITDA ratio is relatively high at 3.48, indicating substantial leverage and potential risk in debt servicing capabilities, especially if earnings do not grow.
   - The ability to secure and renew credit facilities in favorable debt markets shows some financial flexibility, yet reliance on debt raises concerns about long-term financial health.

5. **Stock Repurchase and Capital Expenditures:**
   - The company repurchased shares worth $8.7 million, reflecting confidence from management, but this comes amidst slight revenue and profit strains.
   - Year-to-date capital expenditures are 3.4% of revenues, which is reasonable, but needs to translate into more significant earnings improvements.

6. **Forward-Looking Statements:**
   - The company's guidance anticipates challenges with M&I and continued market weakness. Adjusted EPS for Q4 is expected to be below Street expectations, hinting at possible continued operational challenges.
   - The lack of substantial guidance for 2018 and reliance on end-of-year results to provide better visibility further complicates the investment outlook.

### Market and Competitive Position:

- The comments on competitive pressures and pricing issues in market activities indicate a continually challenging environment, which could inhibit growth and margin improvement.

### Conclusion:

Considering the slight decline in revenue, modest organic growth, high leverage, and operational challenges highlighted in the recent earnings call, it is recommended to maintain an 'Underweight' investment stance towards Stericycle. The company faces significant headwinds and uncertainties that could affect its ability to improve profitability and deliver shareholder value in the near to medium term. Careful monitoring of the operational efficiency, debt management, and market competition will be crucial. Potential investors should look for significant strategic changes and operational improvements before reconsidering their investment stance.
