Regarding future guidance for the fourth quarter, it was mentioned that the company fell short of street expectations due to lower M&I volume, higher costs in Latin America, and the impact of hurricanes. The company provided revised guidance for the fourth quarter, with a range of $1.12 to $1.18 in adjusted EPS. Factors impacting the revised guidance included M&I volume, regulated waste and compliance services revenue, hurricane impacts, international business, and changes in paper prices.

Additionally, the company discussed its anticipation of improved benefit costs and rationalization of its bonus program, as well as favorability due to lower interest rates. The final change in the guidance was estimated at $0.09 on the low end and $0.17 on the top end for a midpoint of $0.13.

Additionally, the company's proactive measures to address market challenges, such as rationalizing bonus programs and capitalizing on favorable debt markets, demonstrate a proactive approach to managing its financial performance.
