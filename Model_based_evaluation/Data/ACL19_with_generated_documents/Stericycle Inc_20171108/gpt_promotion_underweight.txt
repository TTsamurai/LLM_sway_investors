Based on the recent earnings call of the company, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance. The revenue for the third quarter has decreased by 0.8% from Q3 2016, and the organic revenue has also decreased due to various impacts such as foreign exchange, acquisitions, and divestitures. The adjusted income from operations or EBITDA fell short of street expectations by about $0.05 primarily due to lower volume, higher costs, and the impact of multiple hurricanes. The company has also provided revised guidance for Q4, with a lower bottom end and higher top end of the range for expected earnings per share. Additionally, the company expects its 2018 earnings to be flat compared to 2017. The company is facing competitive pricing in the market, and the EBITDA margins have been impacted by revenue shortfalls and the impact of hurricanes. It is important to note that the company has been operating at the mid to low end of their ranges, resulting in a tightening of their ranges. Therefore, it is recommended to approach the company with caution and consider an 'underweight' investment stance.
