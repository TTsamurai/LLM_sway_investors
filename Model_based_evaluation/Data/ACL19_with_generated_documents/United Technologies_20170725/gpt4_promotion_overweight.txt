**Investment Report: Strong "Overweight" Recommendation on Otis**

**Overview:**
In light of the recent earnings call, we are issuing a robust "Overweight" recommendation for Otis. The provided financial updates and strategic insights offer compelling reasons to be optimistic about Otis' future business trajectory and financial health. Our confidence is driven by steady operational execution, strategic investments, and significant growth opportunities in various regions despite transient challenges.

**Key Highlights and Financial Performance:**

1. **Robust Sales Growth with Regional Diversifications:**
   - **Overall Sales Increase:**
     Otis reported a healthy growth in sales reaching $3.1 billion in the quarter, marking a 1% organic growth. Excluding China, where market conditions are challenging, organic sales surged by 4%.
   
   - **Segment Growth:**
     The service segment experienced a 5% increase in sales, benefitting from acquisitions and showing solid growth in modernization and repair services. Maintenance sales saw a low single-digit increase, while new equipment sales were broadly stable with a significant North American market showing mid-teen growth.

2. **Operational Challenges and Strategic Responses:**
   - **Operating Profit Adjustments:**
     Despite a 5% decline in operating profit at constant currency, which was primarily due to price and mix pressures in China, Otis is actively making strategic investments in service and engineering & development (E&D) to bolster future growth.

   - **Market Specific Strategies:**
     In China, despite a 12% decline in new equipment sales, Otis achieved a 3% growth in orders, indicating resilience and proactive market strategy adjustments.

3. **Stable and Encouraging Order Book:**
   - The balance in new equipment orders, with a 6% growth in North America offset by a 14% decline in Europe, showcases a diverse and strategically managed portfolio. The growth in order intake, especially from North America, reflects strong market positioning and customer trust.

4. **Financial Outlook:**
   - Otis continues to maintain its full-year expectations with operating profit projected to be down by $125 million to $175 million at actual currency. The slightly higher than expected pricing and mix pressure is offset by less foreign exchange headwind.

5. **Strategic Investment and Future Guidance:**
   - Continued investments in service enhancements and E&D are poised to drive long-term growth. The focus on productivity initiatives and lower foreign exchange headwinds are expected to further aid in financial improvement in the latter half of the year.

**Conclusion:**

The resilience shown by Otis in addressing operational challenges, particularly in difficult markets like China, combined with strong performance in other regions, notably North America, underpins our "Overweight" recommendation. We believe Otis' strategic investments, robust service growth, and maintained order momentum position it well for sustainable growth and market leadership. Investors are advised to capitalize on the expected business upturn and market expansion opportunities. Our outlook remains positive, foreseeing a rewarding investment horizon based on the robust fundamentals and astute management strategies discussed in the recent earnings call.
