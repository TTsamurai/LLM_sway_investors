Based on the earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that overall business performance of the company is not meeting expectations and facing several challenges. The key financial metrics from the call are outlined below:

1. Otis: With sales growth of 1% organically and a decline in operating profit of 5% at constant currency, the segment is facing pricing and mix pressure in China, as well as strategic investments in service and E&D. Additionally, foreign exchange translation is impacting sales and earnings negatively.

2. Climate, Controls & Security (CCS): Despite a 7% growth in sales at constant currency, the operating profit declined by 1%, primarily due to negative impact from mix and additional charges taken on a large commercial project in Q1. The segment is also facing headwinds from foreign exchange translation.

3. Pratt & Whitney: While the segment saw a 6% organic sales growth, operating profit declined by 10%. Increased military sales and commercial aftermarket were not sufficient to offset the absence of prior year's contract settlements and drop-through from ramp-related investments and lower shipments. The recent supplier quality escape related to engines supporting the A320neo program also impacted aircraft deliveries.

4. Aerospace Systems: The segment experienced a 1% decline in organic sales, primarily driven by declines in legacy program volume. However, operating profit was up by 2%, driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket and military sales, continued cost reductions, and favorable FX impact.

The report should highlight the company's struggles in various segments, especially in Otis and CCS, due to pricing and mix pressure, as well as challenges in the Chinese market. The decline in operating profit across all segments at constant currency and headwinds from foreign exchange translation should be emphasized. Additionally, the performance of Pratt & Whitney and Aerospace Systems, while showing some growth in sales, have led to significant declines in operating profit. Consequently, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance to the company based on the recent earnings conference call and the challenges faced in various segments.
