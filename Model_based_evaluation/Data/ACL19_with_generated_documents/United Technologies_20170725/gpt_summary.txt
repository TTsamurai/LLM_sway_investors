3. Aerospace segment:
- Pratt & Whitney: sales up 6% organically, driven by military engines business
- Commercial aftermarket sales up 4%, with V2500 strength offset by lower sales at Pratt & Whitney Canada
- Operating profit declined 10%, influenced by ramp-related investments and lower Pratt & Whitney Canada shipments

Overall, while certain segments saw growth in sales and equipment orders, operating profit declined in some areas due to various factors such as pricing and mix pressure, foreign exchange headwinds, and investments. Full-year expectations for operating profit and sales growth remain largely unchanged. Additionally, the aftermarket trajectory for Pratt & Whitney engines is expected to remain steady with some modest improvement sequentially.
