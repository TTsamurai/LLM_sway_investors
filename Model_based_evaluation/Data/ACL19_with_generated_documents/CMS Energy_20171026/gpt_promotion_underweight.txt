Based on the company's recent earnings call, there are several factors that suggest a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company's performance. 

Firstly, the company's reported adjusted EPS of $1.66 for the first nine months of 2017, which is only an 8% increase from last year. This growth rate is below the company's historical 7% growth rate, causing uncertainty about their ability to consistently achieve 6% to 8% annual growth as they have projected.

Additionally, the company's emphasis on their "self-funding model" and "adaptability under a variety of changing conditions" raises concerns about their ability to manage unexpected challenges or market changes. The statement that the company does not have "big bets" and is not waiting on one big regulatory outcome is also worrisome, as it suggests a lack of strategic vision or impactful growth initiatives.

Furthermore, the company's focus on operational cost savings and small, focused efforts indicates a lack of significant investment in major growth opportunities. While the company has a consistent track record of delivering 7% EPS growth for 14 years, there are doubts about their ability to sustain this performance, especially with the increasing complexity and competition in the energy industry.

Moreover, the company's reliance on regulatory outcomes and political conditions raises concerns about the uncertainties and risks associated with their long-term planning and growth strategy. Despite the company's announcement of a 6% to 8% annual growth trajectory and the introduction of a 2018 full-year guidance, there is skepticism about their ability to achieve these projections in a competitive and evolving market environment.

In conclusion, based on the information provided in the earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. There are too many uncertainties and red flags that suggest caution about the company's ability to deliver consistent and sustainable results in the long run.
