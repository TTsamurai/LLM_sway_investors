 them. Overall, we are very pleased with our second quarter financial performance. Revenue grew by 21% year-over-year, exceeding the high-end of our guidance, driven by the strong demand for our technologies. Subscription revenue, which constituted 88% of total revenue, saw a significant increase of 20% year-over-year. Our services revenue also exceeded expectations with a growth of 25% year-over-year, driven by additional demand for consulting projects around Ansible and OpenShift. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income grew by 40% year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating margin came in at 26.4%. Our operating cash flow for the quarter increased from the previous year, due to higher profitability and stronger billings and collections. With a healthy cash and investments balance of approximately $2.3 billion, and a total deferred revenue of $2.1 billion, we are in a strong financial position. In terms of our outlook, we are raising our full year revenue guidance to $2.880 billion to $2.895 billion, representing approximately 20% growth in USD and 19% in constant currency. We are also modestly raising our non-GAAP operating margin to 23.8% for the full year and increasing our full year operating cash flow to a range of $880 million to $900 million. We expect revenue for Q3 to be in the range of $730 million to $737 million, up 20% in USD at the high end of the range and 18% in constant currency, with a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 23.7% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.70. We are confident in our continued growth and investment, and are focused on seizing opportunities around digital transformation and hybrid cloud computing. Our strong performance so far this year, along with our outlook for additional growth and investment, supports an 'overweight' investment stance in Red Hat.
