 them. Overall, we are pleased with the company's strong performance and financial results for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2018. The company delivered impressive year-over-year growth of 21% for revenue, 40% for non-GAAP operating income, and 48% for operating cash flow in the second quarter. These strong financial results reflect the company's continued momentum and the global demand for Red Hat technologies.

Subscription revenue, which constituted 88% of total revenue in Q2, was a major driver of the company's growth, with subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings increasing by 14% year-over-year and subscription revenue for application development-related and other emerging technology offerings increasing by 44% year-over-year.

In addition to its strong revenue growth, the company's services revenue also exceeded expectations, coming in at 25% year-over-year growth. The company's non-GAAP operating income of $191 million grew 40% year-over-year, and its non-GAAP operating margin came in at 26.4%.

The company's strong financial performance is further reflected in its balance sheet, which ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2.3 billion and total deferred revenue at quarter end of $2.1 billion, an increase of $372 million or up 22% from the same quarter a year ago.

Furthermore, the company's operating cash flow of $143 million for the quarter increased from the operating cash flow of $97 million in Q2 last year, due to a mix of higher profitability and stronger billings and collections. The company's strong operating cash flow results were also reflected in its FX adjusted day sales outstanding of 56 days, a one day improvement from last year, and a rolling four quarters billings proxy of $745 million, up 20% year-over-year.

Looking ahead, the company has raised its full-year revenue guidance to $2.880 billion to $2.895 billion, up approximately 20% in USD and 19% in constant currency at the high-end of the range. The company has also raised its full year non-GAAP operating margin by 20 basis points to 23.8% and its full year non-GAAP earnings per share outlook to be approximately $2.77 per share to $2.79 per share, assuming approximately $2 million per quarter forecast for net other income, an annual effective tax rate of approximately 28% and approximately 180 million diluted shares.

Overall, the company's strong financial performance, continued momentum, and raising of guidance for the full year indicate a positive future outlook, leading us to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for the company.
