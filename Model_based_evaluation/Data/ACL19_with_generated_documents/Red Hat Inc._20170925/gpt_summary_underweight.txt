 them. So like I said, there’s still -- there’s going to be some increased investments as we work through that. And as we look at the longer margin profile and everything else as Eric mentioned, we’re really looking at reinvesting some of those, certainly in R&D and sales and marketing. So -- but really, we’re looking at trying to drive higher margin professional services revenue streams as well. So I would look forward to us giving more detail on that and that will be at our next Analyst Day in May. Yes. Yeah, yeah. So, I mean, we continue to see good progress there. I mean, I think a lot of it is -- number one, there is a lot more investment on the sales team. I mean, we’ve added substantial amount, probably 40% or 45% increase year-over-year. But a lot of it is also is related to need for services sales. So as we’ve talked about before, a lot of these deals and the emergence of product stack certainly need an awful lot more services to actually implement them. And I think it -- some of it is -- been our continued ability to add much more of the higher end services that we have, specifically both on the technical side and the hybrid cloud practices that we have as related to the number of those billings as related to it. And even probably to the sales team, before kind of reaching the published potential, really effective selling of those complicated, bigger solutions. So with those three things added together, you’re seeing a pretty substantial jump year-over-year in the services revenue created from those billings. Sure. I mean, look, it was certainly a great quarter. There’s an awful lot going on in Q2. So we certainly saw real demand. I think some of the highlights really -- and for those of you that also have the financial release and are just reading along with it -- we beat the top end by $21 million with approximately $5 million due to an improvement in foreign exchange. The balance of it was driven by performance and execution from our global sales team. And I think you also saw that we’ve certainly given a lot of focus as related to the emerging products. But probably more important than that is again is just the leverage that our company saw related to the bottom line. As we continue to see top line growth, you saw a lot of strength in the renewal bookings, but to do it in such a way where we also saw the operating margin expansion. So I think some of the growth areas again are related that we talk a lot about in prior calls. Application development and emerging technologies, growing 44% year-over-year and especially related to the 21% of our -- 21% of total revenue. And really, the growth in services, 25% year-over-year. So, I mean, a lot of investment. So pretty proud of the quarter. I think -- and as we’ve looked forward, I mean, this is also where we think that also will be the start of creating us the -- some substantial multiples for the investors as we continue to drive to those $3 billion annual revenue targets. And we’re giving that guidance now that we’re probably going to do it a year early. So, I do think that will likely be one of the big drivers as we look out over the next 18, 24 months. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for joining us. 

Based on the transcript provided, the financial metrics that stand out and indicate an 'underweight' investment stance are:
- The 21% year-over-year growth for revenue
- Non-GAAP operating income growth of 40%
- Operating cash flow growth of 48%
- Subscription revenue growth, especially in relation to infrastructure-related offerings and application development-related and other emerging technology offerings
- The 20% growth in deals over $1 million and the 20% growth in large deals in the quarter
- The increase in deferred revenue at quarter end by 22% compared to the same quarter a year ago
- The increasing mix of sales through direct sales force and the impact on bookings duration
- The risk associated with investing in sales team hiring and ongoing investments in R&D and sales & marketing to drive higher margin professional services revenue streams.

In conclusion, the report would recommend an 'underweight' investment stance due to the strong financial performance and growth indicators, but also the need for ongoing investments which may impact margins and profitability in the short term.
