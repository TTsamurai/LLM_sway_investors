them. From a foreign currency impact perspective, we don't expect any significant impact on our results for the second half of the fiscal year. As mentioned earlier, we have seen modest improvements in foreign exchange rates against the dollar, but the overall impact has been minimal to our results. In summary, our financial performance in the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2018 has been strong, with revenue, non-GAAP operating income, and operating cash flow all showing significant growth year-over-year. We have also seen strong growth in subscription revenue, particularly for our infrastructure-related offerings and application development-related and other emerging technology offerings. Our services revenue also exceeded expectations, driven by additional demand for consulting projects around Ansible and OpenShift. We have also increased our full year revenue guidance, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP earnings per share outlook, reflecting our confidence in our continued growth and investment. We are well-positioned to continue driving value for our shareholders as we capitalize on the opportunities around digital transformation and hybrid cloud computing.
