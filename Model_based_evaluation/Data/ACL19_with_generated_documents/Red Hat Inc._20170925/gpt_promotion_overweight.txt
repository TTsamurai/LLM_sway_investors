them. But we are a long way away from giving you any kind of specific forecast around that at this point. So I certainly would not expect any of that until next year. In the meantime, weâ€™re just going to continue working on scaling those solutions and see how we can make them more profitable. With that, let me hand it back to Jim. 

Based on the details from the recent earnings call, Red Hat has delivered strong second quarter financial results with significant growth in revenue, non-GAAP operating income, and operating cash flow. With a 21% year-over-year growth in revenue, strong subscription revenue, and a 40% increase in non-GAAP operating income, the company has demonstrated strong execution and demand for its technologies. Additionally, the company's services revenue exceeded expectations with 25% year-over-year growth.

Red Hat has also demonstrated strong financial results, ending the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2.3 billion, while returning $75 million to shareholders through stock repurchases. The company's total deferred revenue at quarter end was $2.1 billion, an increase of $372 million or up 22% year-over-year. Operating cash flow also increased to $143 million for the quarter.

Furthermore, the company's outlook for the full year includes an increase in revenue guidance to $2.880 billion to $2.895 billion, up approximately 20% in USD and 19% in constant currency at the high-end of the range. Red Hat is also raising its non-GAAP operating margin by 20 basis points to 23.8% for the full year and raising its full year non-GAAP earnings per share outlook to be approximately $2.77 per share to $2.79 per share, a 23% year-over-year growth in earnings per share.

In conclusion, based on the company's recent earnings call and strong financial performance, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Red Hat. The company's strong execution, significant growth in revenue and non-GAAP operating income, and positive outlook for the full year provide compelling reasons to consider investing in Red Hat.
