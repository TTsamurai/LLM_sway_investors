Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for Dominion. While the company reported strong operational and safety performance, as well as progress in various growth projects, there are some concerns and uncertainties that impact the future outlook.

1. Uncertainty in the Millstone Power Station's future: The company is awaiting legislative decisions in Connecticut that will impact the future of the Millstone Power Station. Until the process is completed, there is a lack of clarity on how the station will play through under this auction. This uncertainty poses a risk to the company's future earnings and growth plans.

2. Lack of potential M&A or big projects for future growth: The company clarified that there are no major M&A involved in their growth plans and suggested a more programmatic method to achieve future growth post-2020. This lack of potential impactful projects could limit the company's potential for significant future earnings growth.

3. Regulatory and environmental uncertainties: The company is currently awaiting water permits in West Virginia, North Carolina, and Virginia for their Atlantic Coast Pipeline project. While they expect to receive these permits by the middle of December, the regulatory process involves significant back and forth with regulators and poses a potential risk to the project timeline.

4. Market conditions and commodity prices: The company acknowledges that their earnings from farm-out transactions depend on the timing of when the farm-outs come in. Dramatic changes in commodity prices could also impact the company's earnings.

5. Uncertainty surrounding FERC rule-making: The company highlights the ongoing rule-making process initiated by the DOE with FERC, which could impact the industry. The outcome of this process is uncertain and poses a potential risk to the energy market.

Based on these key insights and uncertainties, it is advised to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for Dominion, as there are potential risks and uncertainties that could impact the company's future earnings and growth plans. Investors should carefully consider these factors before making investment decisions.
