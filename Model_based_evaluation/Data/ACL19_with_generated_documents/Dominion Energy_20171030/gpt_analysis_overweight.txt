This demonstrates a strong commitment to safety and operational excellence, which can contribute to the company's long-term success.

2. Growth in Electric Sales: Year-to-date, Dominion has seen a 1.7% increase in weather-normalized electric sales, driven by growth in sales to data centers and residential customers. Additionally, the company has connected 11 new data centers, signaling potential for continued growth in this segment.

3. Renewable Energy Projects: Dominion has multiple solar projects under development and has seen demand for renewables from its customers. With plans to add more solar generation capacity and explore pump storage projects, the company is positioning itself to benefit from the increasing demand for renewable energy sources.

4. Gas Infrastructure Projects: Dominion's gas infrastructure growth projects represent over $1 billion of investment, with several projects completed and more expected to be completed by year-end.

5. Dividend Growth: The company's board of directors has declared a dividend increase of 10% for the fourth quarter of this year, reflecting confidence in Dominion Energy's growth plan and enhanced cash flows.
