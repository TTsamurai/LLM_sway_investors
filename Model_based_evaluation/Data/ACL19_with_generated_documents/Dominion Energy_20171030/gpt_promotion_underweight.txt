 for your question. We expect to start generating LNG next month, then conclude commissioning in December, and we expect to be in service by the end of the year. We have no further updates at this time. Thank you. So, to summarize, our company has delivered strong operational and safety performance, and our growth plans are on track. However, there are pending legislative and regulatory decisions that could impact our future growth and earnings. We are cautious in our outlook and recommend an 'underweight' investment stance based on the uncertainties surrounding our projects and potential regulatory changes. Thank you.
