 for the question. In terms of specific growth projects, we have a number of solar projects under development and have seen demand for renewables from our customers. Year-to-date, six solar facilities totaling approximately 169 megawatts have achieved commercial operation, and for all remaining 2017 projects, panel deliveries have been secured and the projects are on schedule for completion this quarter. In total, we have announced 457 megawatts that will go into service this year, and expect to add another 200 megawatts by the end of next year, increasing our gross operating portfolio from 1,660 megawatts to over 1,800 megawatts, of which 700 will be in Virginia and North Carolina. We have also announced the addition of solar generation to serve a new data center Facebook plans to build in Central Virginia. Pending State Corporation Commission approval, this need will be met with a new rate option, Schedule RF, which will allow large energy users to meet their needs through the addition of renewable energy resources. In addition to solar projects, we are currently evaluating the potential for pump storage project in the coalfield region of Virginia and have also contracted with Virginia Tech to study the feasibility of using an abandoned coal mine in Wise County to construct a pump storage facility. The General Assembly has enacted legislation stating that construction of one or more new pump storage electric generating facilities in Southwest Virginia is in the public interest with costs recoverable through a rate rider. We have also announced a long-term investment program to modernize our Dominion Energy Transmission's pipeline and storage infrastructure, with investments expected to total about $250 million per year. With these growth initiatives in place, as well as the completion of the Cove Point Liquefaction Project and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and Supply Header Project, we expect earnings of at least 10% in 2018, driven by these projects and additional 6% to 8% growth from 2017 to 2020, with further earnings per share growth of at least 5% per year thereafter, supported by a diverse set of growth programs. These investments and growth initiatives support our plan to share the benefits with our shareholders by growing our dividend at a 10% rate through at least 2020. Thank you.
