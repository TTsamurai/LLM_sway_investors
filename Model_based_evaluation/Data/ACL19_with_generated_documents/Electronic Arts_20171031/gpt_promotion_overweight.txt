Based on the company's recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on EA (Electronic Arts) as a stock promoter. The company reported a strong performance in the second quarter, with notable growth in digital purchases and live services for their sports titles. The net revenue was higher than expected, and the operating expenses were lower than projected. The company also experienced a significant increase in digital net bookings, with digital net bookings representing 63% of their business on a trailing 12-month basis. The company's cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $4.4 billion, with 35% of this balance held onshore.

The growth priorities for the company continue to be the expansion of their live services, including the integration of their esports business across many other titles. The addition of new genres and business models, including a subscription business, is also a focus. EA continues to deliver profitable growth in their mobile business, with The Sims 4 and other unannounced titles poised to drive further growth in the future. The company's event-driven live services continue to be the bedrock of their business, with a forecasted 10% to 15% growth in fiscal 2018.

Additionally, EA has raised its guidance for net bookings, from $5.1 billion to $5.15 billion, driven by the strength in Ultimate Team. The company's plans for the future include the launch of the next Battlefield game and the action genre game, Anthem. They also expect their subscriber base to continue growing, with new mobile titles benefitting from players looking for deeper experiences with higher production values. The impact of their success in esports driving Ultimate Team revenues and the upcoming FIFA World Cup in Russia are expected to drive interest in soccer around the globe.

Overall, EA's strong performance, focus on live services, and future growth priorities make an 'overweight' investment stance compelling for potential investors.
