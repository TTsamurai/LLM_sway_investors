### Key Financial Metrics Analysis
- The growth in **Digital Net Bookings**, now representing 63% of total bookings, signifies an accelerating shift towards digital distribution, positively influencing margin profiles but increasing dependency on digital market dynamics.
- **Live Services** grew by 22%, noticeable in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Team, pointing to sustained user engagement and a promising recurring revenue stream. The reliance on live services, however, heightens exposure to market fluctuations and player retention challenges.
- **Mobile Net Bookings** achieved a record Q2 high, indicating robust performance but raising concerns regarding sustainability amid fierce competition in the mobile gaming space.
- The company's **Cash and Short-term Investments** stood at $4.4 billion, with a considerable portion held onshore which could affect liquidity strategies under changing tax laws.
  
### Investment Stance: Underweight
#### Rationale:
1. **Rising Operating Expenses**: Despite managing lower than guided this quarter, continuous investments into new genres and services are anticipated to increase operating expenses. This could pressure margins if revenue growth from new streams does not outpace cost increases.
  
2. **Dependence on Few Titles**: The substantial revenue driven by Ultimate Team and select key titles suggests a concentrated risk. Any disruptions or declines in popularity in these could significantly affect overall financial health.
  
3. **Shift to Digital**: While beneficial for margins, the accelerated shift to digital introduces vulnerability to online market dynamics, including competition, platform dependency, and digital rights management issues.
  
4. **Market Saturation and Competition**: With high reliance on live events and services, EA faces the challenge of keeping content fresh amid intense competition and potential consumer fatigue.
  
5. **International Currency Fluctuations**: Despite hedging strategies, the company still faces FX headwinds, which could impact earnings, particularly given its substantial global market involvement. 

### Conclusion
Given the points above, the recommendation is to maintain an 'Underweight' investment stance on EA. The company shows promising areas such as digital growth and live service expansion but is countered by challenges such as heightened competition, operational cost management, and reliance on a limited number of high-performing titles. Further observations on strategy implementation and market adaptation are warranted before reassessing the investment position.
