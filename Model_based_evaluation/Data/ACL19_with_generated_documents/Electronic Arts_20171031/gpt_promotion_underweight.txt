It is important to be cautious and skeptical when considering an investment in this company based on its recent earnings call. The company reported strong digital growth, but its operating cash flow for the quarter was down $70 million from last year. Additionally, it is important to note that the company's growth in live services, including mobile live services, was nearly half of its net bookings over the last 12 months. The company also mentioned that it is raising its guidance for net bookings from $5.1 billion to $5.15 billion due to the strength in Ultimate Team, which may indicate that the company is heavily reliant on this specific aspect of its business. There are also unknowns related to the launch of Star Wars Battlefront II and the sale of The Sims 4 on console, which could impact the company's future performance. Additionally, the company's cautious approach to marketing expenses and the potential for discounts on its products during the holiday season should also be taken into consideration when evaluating an investment in the company. Given these factors, it may be wise to approach an investment in the company with an 'underweight' stance.
