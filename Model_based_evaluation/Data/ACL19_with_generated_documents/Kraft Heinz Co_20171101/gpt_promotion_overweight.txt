 to get to a point where we start seeing savings. So I think as we go forward, you should expect to see this start to improve and flow through into the EBITDA line. And that's something that we are confident in seeing happen as we go forward. And to answer the second part of your question, we do expect to see improvement in the balance of pricing and commodity costs in Q4. And that will allow for better flow through of our cost savings to the bottom line. Thank you, Tom. This is David, and thanks for the question. So I'd say the organic growth in the U.S. was a mixed bag for Q3. On one hand, we saw consumption-led growth in some product categories, which was positive. On the other hand, we saw some distribution losses, which had a negative impact. Pricing began to improve in Q3, but not as much as we had anticipated due to a step-up in commodity costs during the quarter. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect solid EBITDA growth to continue, driven by a focus on profitable sales and further cost savings. In Canada, similar to the U.S., the focus on profitable sales paid off in Q3, resulting in solid EBITDA growth and margin expansion. As we look ahead to Q4, we expect a similar picture with solid underlying growth and a good level of in-store activity. In Europe, we saw very solid growth in Q3, driven by strong consumption gains and cost control efforts. Looking forward, we expect organic sales growth to be slightly less robust in Q4, but still expect EBITDA growth to continue. In the Rest of World segment, we expect the impact of one-off factors to fade in Q4 with organic sales reaccelerating, and better leverage of investments driving stronger EBITDA growth. So overall, we remain confident in a strong earnings profile, driven by a combination of profitable organic sales and EBITDA growth. Thank you.
