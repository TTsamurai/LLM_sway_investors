Based on the recent earnings call, it is evident that CME Group has achieved double-digit net adjusted EPS growth and has shown progress in acquiring new global customers while maintaining expense discipline. However, it is important to note that the company has recently divested from certain investments in Europe and Brazil, and has also ceased its credit business, signaling a lack of success in those ventures. While the company's CEO Terry Duffy expresses confidence in the company's direction and focus on end-user client acquisition, there are concerns about potential M&A activity and the impact of regulatory changes on the business. Additionally, the company appears to be focused on adding value for clients rather than prioritizing shareholder value. Overall, these factors point to a cautious outlook on CME Group and a recommendation for an 'underweight' investment stance.
