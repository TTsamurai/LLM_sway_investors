#### Investment Highlights

1. **Strong Earnings Growth**: Ameren reported a substantial increase in earnings per share (EPS) from $2.56 in 2015 to $2.68 in 2016. This solid growth trajectory is underpinned by effective strategic execution and disciplined cost management. Furthermore, the company forecasts EPS growth to between $2.65 and $2.85 for 2017, reflecting an approximate 6.5% increase compared to weather-normalized 2016 results.

2. **Robust Regulatory Framework Advancements**: Ameren has successfully advocated for the Future Energy Jobs Act in Illinois, enhancing its regulatory framework which extends constructive formula rate-making through 2022. This legislation supports ongoing and future infrastructure investments, enabling the continuation of robust energy efficiency programs. 

3. **Strategic Capital Allocations**: In 2016, Ameren invested $2.1 billion in utility infrastructure, with a significant portion allocated to growth-driving projects such as the Illinois Rivers project. Such strategic investments are expected to bolster long-term earnings through improved service and operational excellence.

4. **Legislative and Regulatory Support in Missouri**: The Missouri Economic Development and Infrastructure Investment Act (Senate Bill 190) has gained significant legislative traction. This bill is poised to improve the regulatory environment, unlocking potential for $1 billion of incremental infrastructure investments over five years.

5. **Commitment to Clean Energy and Technology**: Ameren is actively investing in clean energy solutions and innovative technologies such as smart meters. Additionally, the company plans to transition its generation to a cleaner and more diverse portfolio, further aligning with sustainability trends and potential federal policy shifts.

6. **Attractive Dividend Yield**: With a current dividend yield of approximately 3.3% and a history of consistent dividend growth, Ameren offers an appealing income component. The anticipated continuation of increasing dividends is supported by projected sustainable earnings growth and a strong financial position.

#### Financial Outlook and Future Growth
Ameren's financial outlook is promising, with expected rate base growth of 6% compounded annually from 2016 through 2021. This growth is supported by Amerenâ€™s strategic focus on enhancing operational efficiencies and investing in high-return projects within favorable regulatory frameworks.

#### Risk Considerations
While Ameren displays a strong profile, investors should consider potential risks such as regulatory changes, unforeseen economic downturns impacting consumer and industrial demand, and transitions in energy policy at the federal level. However, Ameren's proactive regulatory engagement and strategic foresight in infrastructure and technology investments significantly mitigate these risks.

#### Conclusion
Given Ameren's robust earnings growth, strategic capital investments, advantageous regulatory improvements, and a strong commitment to sustainability and shareholder returns, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance. Ameren is well-positioned to outperform its peers and deliver attractive total returns, making it a compelling choice for equity investors seeking growth and stability in the utilities sector.
