Based on the recent earnings call, Ameren Corp. is poised for continued growth and success. The company reported 2016 earnings of $2.68 per share, showing solid earnings growth driven by strategic execution. Their investment in utility infrastructure and effective project management has contributed to their financial results. Ameren continues to work towards enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies, demonstrating a commitment to long-term success.

Ameren's strategic focus on investing in utilities in alignment with existing regulatory frameworks is paying off, with anticipated strong earnings per share growth and rate base growth. The company's plans for future investment in energy grid modernization and smarter technologies indicate a forward-thinking approach to maintaining and creating value for customers and shareholders.

In Missouri, Ameren's efforts to enhance the state's regulatory framework for electric service have shown progress, exemplified by the collaboration with major parties to reach an agreement in principle on all issues related to electric rate review. Additionally, ongoing advocacy for Senate Bill 190 and engagement with stakeholders demonstrate a commitment to regulatory reforms that would drive infrastructure investments and significant benefits for Missouri.

As Ameren continues to focus on strategic and disciplined allocation of capital, with an emphasis on modernizing electric and gas transmission and distribution operations, the company anticipates superior value for customers and shareholders. The company's projected earnings per share growth rate, rate base growth, and attractive dividend yield all point towards an opportunity for an attractive total return for investors compared to their regulated utility peers.

Overall, based on Ameren's recent performance and strategic outlook, a recommendation to take an 'overweight' investment stance on the company would be prudent. The company's strong financial results, ongoing investment in infrastructure, and commitment to regulatory advocacy positions Ameren as an attractive investment option for potential shareholders.
