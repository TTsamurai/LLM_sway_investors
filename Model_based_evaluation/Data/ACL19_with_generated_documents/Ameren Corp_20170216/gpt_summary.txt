Here is your summary report on the recent earnings conference call transcripts:

Ameren announced earnings of $2.68 per share for 2016, compared to $2.56 per share for 2015, indicating solid earnings growth driven by successful execution of its strategy. The company invested $2.1 billion in utility infrastructure in 2016, with significant investments in FERC-regulated electric transmission and Illinois regulated electric and natural gas distribution businesses. The Illinois Rivers project, a new high-voltage transmission line, is on schedule for completion in 2019.

In Missouri, Ameren filed a rate review request in July to recover infrastructure investment costs and remove the negative earnings effect of lower sales to the New Madrid smelter. An agreement in principle on all issues in this rate review has been reached, with stipulation and agreement expected to be filed with the Missouri Public Service Commission soon.

The company has made good progress in advocating for responsible energy and economic policies, including success in advocating for the Illinois Future Energy Jobs Act, and approval of two solar pilot programs in Missouri. Ameren expects its 2017 earnings per share to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.85.

Ameren's strategic focus includes creating and capitalizing on opportunities for investment that benefit customers and shareholders. The company's ongoing efforts to enhance Missouri's electric regulatory framework, including support for Senate Bill 190, aims to drive significant infrastructure investments and create jobs in the state.

The company supports comprehensive tax reform and expects the impact on its earnings growth to be minimal. Ameren's capital allocation plan aims to modernize its energy grid and transition to a cleaner and more diverse generation portfolio, with a focus on investing in electric and gas transmission and distribution operations.

Ameren expects earnings per share to grow at a 5% to 8% compound annual rate from 2016 to 2020, with rate base growth at a strong 6% compound annual rate over the 2016 through 2021 period. The company's dividend payout ratio is expected to range between 55% and 70% of annual earnings, and future dividend increases will be based on earnings growth and economic conditions.

Overall, Ameren believes its strong rate base and earnings growth profile offer an attractive total return opportunity for shareholders compared to its regulated utility peers. The company remains focused on executing its strategy to deliver superior value to shareholders, customers, and communities.
