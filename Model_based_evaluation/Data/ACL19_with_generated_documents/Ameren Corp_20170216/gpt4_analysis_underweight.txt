## Investment Outlook Report: Ameren Corporation

### Recommendation: Underweight

**1. Overview:**
Ameren Corporation, during its annual earning conference, has outlined a solid performance for the year 2016 with an EPS of $2.68 compared to $2.56 in 2015. The company's strategic investments and regulatory adaptations in Illinois, and its proactive efforts in Missouri Senate Bill 190 demonstrate a long-term commitment to infrastructure and regulatory improvements.

**2. Financials:**
- **Earnings Growth:** Ameren projects future earnings with an EPS growth of 5% to 8% annually from 2016 to 2020 and rate base growth of 6% compounded annually through 2021. Although these reflect steady growth, the growth rates are contingent upon regulatory approvals and successful legislative reforms.
- **Investment in Infrastructure:** Capital investments are robust with $2.1 billion invested in 2016, heavily skewed toward regions with supportive regulatory frameworks. Forward investments anticipate substantial increases in regulated rate base, potentially enhancing stability.

**3. Regulatory Dependencies:**
- Ameren's growth projections heavily rely on enhanced and supportive regulatory frameworks, particularly in Missouri. The recent approval in Illinois augurs well; however, success is pending in Missouri which introduces a risk dependent on legislative outcomes.
- The progress on Senate Bill 190 is promising, yet the true effect on operational and financial structure will hinge on the approval process and subsequent regulatory support.

**4. Strategic Risks:**
- **Infrastructure Focus:** While infrastructure investments are generally positive, the significant focus on expanding and modernizing grid infrastructure places Ameren in a vulnerable position should any regulatory support be delayed or denied.
- **Energy Transition:** As the company moves toward a cleaner energy generation mix, there's an inherent uncertainty associated with transitioning and its associated costs, including the potential decommissioning and capital reallocation from conventional to renewable sources.

**5. Tax Reform Considerations:**
- Ameren supports comprehensive tax reforms predicted to lower corporate taxes which could benefit operational costs. However, the exact impact remains uncertain given the early stages of these reforms and changing political landscapes.

**6. Financial Health:**
- Ameren posits a strong balance sheet with robust credit metrics. Yet, the possibility of fluctuating cash flows and the need for evaluating additional equity or debt raises concerns about financial flexibility under changing regulatory and economic statuses.

**7. Industry and Economic Impact:**
- The regulatory improvements and the companyâ€™s commitment to clean, efficient energy are aligned with broader industry trends; however, economic variability and the potential rise in operational compliance costs impact projected profitability.

**8. Dividend and Yield:**
- Current shareholder returns through dividends are competitive; however, continued or enhanced returns will depend heavily on earnings and cash flow consistency. The projection of managed payout ratios between 55% and 70% suggests a conscious balance of reinvestment and shareholder return.

### Conclusion

While Ameren Corporation presents a stable and well-articulated strategic growth plan through infrastructure improvements and regulatory collaboration, its medium-term financial outlook and substantial dependence on legislative actions in Missouri present unpredictability. Until more definitive outcomes materialize regarding the regulatory changes and their implications, the advisable position would be underweight. Investors should closely monitor legislative advancements, regulatory resolutions, and any shifts in economic policy impacting utility infrastructure investments.
