 for us. And beyond all of that, and that's really unique about luspatercept, I think, we have the opportunity to go into indications that are not served by the competition of erythropoietin stimulating agents. And lastly, over time, can transform the market in this indication. So we're very, very excited about this asset. Thank you, everyone, for your time and attention today. We appreciate your continued interest in Celgene. We're pleased to report very strong results for our Hematology & Oncology franchise for the second quarter. We believe we are well-positioned for continued growth through 2020. We look forward to updating you on our progress in future calls. Thank you.
