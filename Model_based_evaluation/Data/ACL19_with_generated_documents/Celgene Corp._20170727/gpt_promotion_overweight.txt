Dear Investors,

We are excited to present a compelling promotion on Hematology & Oncology franchise, recommending an 'overweight' investment stance based on the recent earnings call. In the second quarter, we delivered outstanding sales performance with a 16% year-over-year growth and a 7% sequential growth. Our flagship product, REVLIMID, continues to exhibit exceptional performance, with increases in share and duration across key markets. POMALYST/IMNOVID also experienced significant growth, and ABRAXANE maintained stable demand, particularly in pancreatic cancer.

We are awaiting U.S. approval of IDHIFA, our oral targeted IDH2 inhibitor for relapsed refractory AML in August, which is a significant milestone for our company. Additionally, our collaboration with BeiGene for BGB-A317 in solid tumors is expected to accelerate our solid tumor strategy and broaden the potential of our immuno-oncology portfolio.

Our near-term pipeline and future growth drivers are promising, with multiple pivotal programs in various stages of development, including marizomib in glioblastoma, bb2121 in relapsed refractory myeloma, and luspatercept in front-line low-risk MDS.

Furthermore, we are actively working towards maximizing the potential of BGB-A317 through a comprehensive global solid tumor development plan. With all these exciting developments, we are confident in the continued growth of our Hematology & Oncology franchise through 2020.

On the international front, we are addressing distributor buying patterns and volatility in sales patterns for REVLIMID, and we anticipate continued growth in the European market once reimbursement is gained in Q3. The potential for increasing treatment duration and the uptake of novel triplets in relapsed refractory myeloma in multiple European markets presents additional growth opportunities.

Overall, the recent earnings call reflects the exceptional performance of our company and the promising outlook for our future growth. We are actively pursuing multiple strategic initiatives to diversify our portfolio and maximize the potential of our pipeline assets. We are confident in the long-term success of our company and recommend an 'overweight' investment stance based on these recent developments.

Thank you for your continued support and confidence in our company.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
