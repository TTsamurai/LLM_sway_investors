 for us. Finally, I think we have a nice combination strategy with luspatercept in MDS and in myelofibrosis, and we are working on a new molecule where we see pre-clinical data that look really fascinating. So I think it's a very broad and comprehensive program, and we're looking forward to a lot of news by the end of the year. Thank you for the question, Sandra. Let me start with the demand supply inventory. The first thing I want to say is that we have excellent visibility into the demand, especially in the U.S. Our monitoring capabilities are very sophisticated, and they showed strong underlying patient demand, as we have seen sequentially increased volume growth and market share gains since the first quarter in newly diagnosed myeloma. In addition, we are seeing continued growth in treatment duration in the U.S. , driven by stem cell transplant launches and duration increases with triplet combinations. With regard to distributor buying patterns, as we've said in previous calls, the quarterly trends were affected in part by purchasing decisions made by distributors. In particular, we saw some pull forward into Q1 due to the announcement of a price increase. As well, we had a positive impact from clinical trials and drug supplies. When correcting for these factors and looking at the true in-the-market sales trends, we see a steady progression of increasing volume and net sales that matches the strong uptake we are seeing in newly diagnosed market share. We continue to monitor these trends and stay in constant communication with our distributor partners to optimal inventory levels. When it comes to the supply chain and inventory levels, we're a very efficient operation, and we're able to make quick adjustments, as necessary, to controlled inventory and optimize working capital. In summary, we remain very confident in our ability to meet equitable market demand. Hi, Raymond. Thank you for the question. Let me start by addressing the positive clinical data and milestones we've achieved in the second quarter. In summary, we achieved significant progress in the quarter with our near-term pipeline and future growth drivers. We anticipate U.S. approval of IDHIFA, our oral targeted IDH2 inhibitor for relapsed refractory AML in August. In addition, we completed enrollment into four Phase III trials for key assets, and we are preparing to initiate several pivotal programs by the end of the year. We are excited about our collaboration with BeiGene for BGB-A317 in solid tumors, which significantly accelerates our solid tumor strategy and broadens the potential of our growing immuno-oncology portfolio. We are awaiting results of several pivotal trials by year end, including AUGMENT in relapsed refractory indolent lymphoma and RELEVANCE in front-line follicular lymphoma. We are also preparing to submit an sNDA for RVd in first-line transplant and non-transplant patients in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2018. Finally, we are continuing to work on maximizing the potential of BGB-A317, as a single agent and in combination with targeted agents, chemotherapy, and our novel and differentiated I-O pipeline assets. Thank you for the question, Eric. I think you'll find we are very upbeat about the results of the ABRAXANE adjuvant pancreatic cancer trial and the potential of the ABRAXANE/TECENTRIQ combination trials in non-small-cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer, which will read out in 2018. Outside of the U.S. , ABRAXANE grew 25% year over year, with continued growth in pancreatic cancer. We anticipate multiple growth drivers in the future for ABRAXANE. We are also very excited about the recent announcement of our new strategic immuno-oncology collaboration with BeiGene. We are acquiring worldwide rights outside of Asia, excluding Japan, to develop and commercialize BGB-A317, an advanced clinical stage PD-1 inhibitor for solid tumors. We believe that BGB-A317 is potentially differentiated and provides us with the ability to combine a checkpoint inhibitor with our broad immuno-oncology portfolio. Thank you, and we look forward to sharing more details later in the year. Thank you for the question, Eric. We had another great quarter for the Hematology & Oncology franchise. We achieved excellent sales performance, and we reached significant clinical milestones. Near-term growth drivers are in place, with U.S. approval of IDHIFA for relapsed refractory AML expected in August. We continue to make progress with our near-term pipeline, completing enrollment into four Phase III trials, as well as preparing to initiate pivotal programs for many additional assets by the end of this year. We're excited about our collaboration with BeiGene for BGB-A317 in solid tumors, which significantly accelerates our solid tumor strategy and broadens the potential of our growing immuno-oncology portfolio. Finally, we have made great progress toward initiating multiple pivotal programs in hematological malignancies and expanding our I-O portfolio. Thank you, and we look forward to sharing more details later in the year.
