, with a significant impact on our financial metrics.

Overall, based on the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, the Hematology & Oncology franchise at Celgene is performing exceptionally well. The key financial metrics indicate strong sales performance, with REVLIMID, POMALYST/IMNOVID, and ABRAXANE showing impressive year-over-year and sequential growth. The company has made significant progress in its near and mid-term pipeline, completing enrollment into multiple Phase III trials and expecting U.S. approval of IDHIFA in IDH2 relapsed refractory AML in August.

The international markets have shown strong growth potential for REVLIMID and POMALYST/IMNOVID, and the company is actively working on gaining reimbursement in various countries to drive further growth. In addition, the strategic collaboration with BeiGene for BGB-A317 in solid tumors is expected to accelerate the solid tumor strategy and broaden the potential of the immuno-oncology portfolio.

In terms of future growth drivers, the company is preparing to submit an sNDA for RVd in first-line transplant and non-transplant patients in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2018. The results of key clinical trials, such as the AUGMENT trial in relapsed refractory indolent lymphoma and the pivotal ABRAXANE/TECENTRIQ combination trials in non-small-cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer, are expected to be available by the end of 2017 and in 2018, respectively.

The company is also focused on developing combinatorial approaches for its immuno-oncology portfolio, including CAR-T and bi-specific T-cell engager programs, as well as the potential of the newly acquired BGB-A317. The pipeline encompasses a comprehensive global solid tumor development plan, with updates expected at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) conference.

The commercial opportunities for the company's assets are significant, particularly in the relapsed refractory AML and first-line AML patient populations. Additionally, the company's focus on combination therapies and deep translational work is expected to yield differentiated and potentially impactful results across various patient segments.

Overall, the performance and progress of the Hematology & Oncology franchise at Celgene indicate strong potential for future growth and success. Based on the detailed summary of the conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance on Celgene, considering the positive financial metrics and the promising outlook for the company's pipeline and growth drivers.
