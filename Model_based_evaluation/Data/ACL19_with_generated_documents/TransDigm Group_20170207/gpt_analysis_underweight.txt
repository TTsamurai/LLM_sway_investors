 quarter versus this quarter are. And I may have missed that. As I understood in your response, you still have a feeling of caution because of the timing to deploy military readiness spending during Q1. Yes, that's correct. Given the lag time between deciding to spend and actually deploying the funds for military readiness, I would be cautiously optimistic about predicting any significant change in the near term. Overall, there has been a good reception to our military products and services, and increased readiness spending would likely be positive for our business. However, I cannot guarantee any significant change until we see concrete signs of increased spending. In the meantime, we will continue to monitor the situation. Thank you for your question.
