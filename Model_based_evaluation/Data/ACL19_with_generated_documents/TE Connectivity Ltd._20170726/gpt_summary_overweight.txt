. Let me just add a few additional highlights to this. When you look at our third quarter, we delivered sales of $3.4 billion, representing 8% organic growth year-over-year with growth across all segments and regions. This growth is a reflection of the ongoing effective implementation of our strategy to create safer, sustainable, productive, and connected solutions for our customers.

Our adjusted operating margin saw a 50 basis points expansion year-over-year and adjusted earnings per share of $1.24 increased by 15% over the prior year. This growth was mainly driven by our sales and operating income performance, with half of the increase driven by higher sales growth of 8% and the remainder by taxes and currency. As a result of our momentum and what we're seeing in our markets in orders, we are raising the mid-point of our revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance to $12.9 billion and $4.73 in EPS. This represents 7% organic revenue growth and 20% adjusted EPS growth versus the prior year.

Our order trends also showed broad-based strength, with total orders (excluding SubCom) at $3.3 billion, up 12% year-over-year on both reported and organic basis. This growth was evenly distributed across the Americas, Asia, and Europe, reinforcing expectations for higher growth versus our prior view. Notably, orders in the Transportation segment increased 15% organically, in the Industrial segment by 6% organically, and in Communications by 12% organically.

In summary, we firmly believe that TE is firing on all cylinders with all segments contributing to both revenue growth and margin expansion this year. Our guidance for the year is now raised to represent 7% organic revenue growth and 20% adjusted earnings per share growth for 2017, driven almost entirely by our strong operational performance. Our results represent best-in-class performance, with 7% organic growth, expanded operating margins, and 20% adjusted EPS growth, reflecting the execution along all the levers we have in our business model.

Lastly, we continue to see strong demand and growth momentum in our automotive segment, especially in areas such as electric vehicles, where we expect content growth to drive strong performance in the future. Our focus on high-speed ramps in cloud infrastructure and the strong growth cycle of our SubCom business also reinforce our strategic progress and demonstrate that we are well-positioned to deliver growth ahead of our markets.
