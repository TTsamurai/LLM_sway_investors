, for the question. On the tax rate, as we've discussed before, we do have a very tax efficient structure. And so, when we think about where we might be on that for longer term, we've talked about being in the mid 20% range on a cash basis and then having some impacts for onetime items and then having noncash depreciation that does not impact us. So we think we're in the mid-20% range. This year, obviously, our tax rate has been lower than that due to some items with the tax reform that occurred at the end of last year. So it is possible that our tax rate might settle somewhere a little below that 20% that we'd talked about, but still a little higher than what we're running this year. And so, we think on a go-forward basis, we'll be closer to where we've targeted in the past. Thanks, Sherri. And with that, let me turn it back to Sujal for closing remarks. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your questions and look forward to further discussions. We're very excited about our performance in the third quarter and our outlook for the future. We believe we are well-positioned to continue delivering strong results and value for our shareholders.
