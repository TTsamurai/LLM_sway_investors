for the question. When it comes to taxes, I want to highlight that our increased earnings per share are driven almost entirely by our strong organic growth performance and operating income expansion in 2017. We have also benefited from using our strong cash flow model both via adding on bolt-on M&A and returning capital to our owners. Heath will provide more detail on the tax implications. As for the increased earnings per share and growth in margin, we expect Transportation Solutions to grow mid-single digits organically on approximately 3% global auto production growth this year, reflecting continued content growth and share gains. We also expect growth in commercial transportation across all regions in the fourth quarter, and although we expect to have some lingering effects on margins from supply chain dynamics in the fourth quarter, we expect margin performance to improve as these issues are resolved in early 2018. In Industrial Solutions, we expect to grow high single digits on a reported basis and mid-single digits organically, with growth expected across all three of our business units. We also expect operating margins to expand sequentially as well as year-over-year in the fourth quarter. In Communications, we expect mid-single-digit growth on both the reported and organic basis, with growth in each of our three businesses. We also expect SubCom to maintain high-single-digit growth in the next fiscal year. Thank you for your question, and we will provide further guidance in our first quarter call.
