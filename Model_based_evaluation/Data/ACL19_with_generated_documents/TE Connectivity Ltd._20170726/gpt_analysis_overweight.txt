. From a tax standpoint, when you look at our tax rate for the year, it's clearly very low and we have built that into our guidance. We're benefiting from some tax planning that we did earlier in the year and some benefits from acquisitions that are impacting our tax rate. As we look forward, we do expect our tax rate to normalize in future years. So, we have built that into our guidance and we'll continue to monitor that as we look forward into next year. Thank you for the questions.
