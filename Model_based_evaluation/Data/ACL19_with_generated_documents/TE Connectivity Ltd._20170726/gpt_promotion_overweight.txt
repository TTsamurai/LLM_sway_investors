. So, when we look at taxes, we have had a benefit year-over-year from the lower tax rate. As we mentioned, it was an unusually low tax rate last year. It was about 17.7% rate last year. This year is more normalized around 22.7%, so there's definitely a benefit year-over-year based on that lower tax rate last year. And that's something that we have factored into our earnings per share guidance for the year. I hope that answers your question. Let us know if you have any more.
