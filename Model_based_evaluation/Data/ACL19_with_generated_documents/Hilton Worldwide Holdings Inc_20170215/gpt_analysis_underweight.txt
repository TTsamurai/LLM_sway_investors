Based on the earnings conference call transcript, there are several key insights and financial metrics that support an 'underweight' investment stance for Hilton Holdco. Firstly, the company reported modest growth in RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room) throughout the year, with system-wide RevPAR growth at around 1.5% to 2%. The company also highlighted an increase in corporate business post-election, indicating stronger performance in the business transient segment.

Furthermore, the company emphasized its focus on unit growth and expansion of its brand portfolio, with significant developments in new brands such as Home2, Tru by Hilton, and Tapestry Collection by Hilton. The focus on new brand development and global expansion highlights the company's aggressive growth strategy, which may be a cause for concern given the potentially higher risk associated with new initiatives.

In addition, the company's emphasis on returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases further supports an 'underweight' investment stance. Despite the company's positive outlook, the cautious approach to returning capital and the need for strong investment in new developments may signal potential challenges and uncertainty in the future.

Overall, based on the insights and financial metrics derived from the company's recent earnings conference call transcript, an 'underweight' investment stance may be warranted due to potential risks and uncertainties associated with the company's growth strategy.
