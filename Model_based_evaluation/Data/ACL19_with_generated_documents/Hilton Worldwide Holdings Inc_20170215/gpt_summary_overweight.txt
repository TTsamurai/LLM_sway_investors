Thank you for providing the transcript. Based on this information, it is clear that Hilton is experiencing positive momentum and growth in key financial metrics, particularly in terms of RevPAR growth, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. The company's focus on same-store growth and net unit growth is leading to strong performance. The global economic indicators are also favorable, with positive forecasts for U.S. GDP and non-residential fixed investment growth.

In terms of unit growth, Hilton's strategic focus on development has led to record signings, openings, and construction starts. The company has expanded its system footprint and global presence across new countries, showing strong growth potential. Additionally, the loyalty program, Hilton Honors, has seen significant growth in memberships and member-driven occupancy. The company's strong digital channels, including website and mobile bookings, continue to outpace other channels, indicating a shift towards direct customer relationships.

In terms of capital return, Hilton's new simplified business model with growth financed by third-party capital is generating meaningful free cash flow. The company intends to be disciplined in returning capital to shareholders, primarily through share repurchases.

Overall, based on the strong performance indicated in the earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance on Hilton. The company's strategic focus on growth, strong financial metrics, and positive industry trends support a favorable investment outlook.
