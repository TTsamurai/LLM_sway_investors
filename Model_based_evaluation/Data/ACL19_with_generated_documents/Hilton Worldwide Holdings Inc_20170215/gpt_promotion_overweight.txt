. Thank you for joining us. Based on the recent earnings call and the company's strong performance, we are recommending an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. With solid growth in RevPAR, record signings and net unit growth, as well as the successful launch of new brands, the company is positioned for continued success. Additionally, the focus on driving direct relationships with customers through its loyalty program and digital channels is expected to drive incremental value for guests and the overall system. With a disciplined approach to returning capital to shareholders, including a buyback program, the company is well-positioned for growth and value creation. This is an exciting time for the company, and we believe it presents a compelling investment opportunity. Thank you for your attention and please let me know if you have any questions.
