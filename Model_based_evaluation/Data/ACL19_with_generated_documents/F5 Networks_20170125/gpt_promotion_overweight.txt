to give any indication of how well we expect it to be. Weâ€™re four, five months ahead of that. As far as forecast and pipeline, when I talked about my expectation of product revenue growth improving year-over-year possibly in Q2 and the second half of fiscal 2017, that definitely is pale using what we see in the pipeline and forecasts from the sales teams. And I brought a couple of examples there to show customer wins. And so we expect those and more will go into the second half of fiscal 2017.
