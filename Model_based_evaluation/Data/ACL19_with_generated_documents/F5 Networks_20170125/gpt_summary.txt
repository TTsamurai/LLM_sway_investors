 to give any kind of context on our estimates apart from the fact that we feel very confident in the sales team in federal. And then on operating margins, I think we were at about 36.5%, but the guidance of 37.5% is down a couple of factors from a year-over-year comparison. Those couple of factors are mainly from gross margins, which is hitting opex. And the other one is probably round about the SG&A. You might have caught Andy’s word in terms of a couple of cost type increases quarter-over-quarter that maybe we didn’t expect. And so instead of – initially before the guidance, I probably initially thought we were a little bit too conservative but if I look at it, actually we’re coming down to the bottom end of the guidance given the numbers/subsequent to the – when we reported what happened in December for instance. And then the other aspect to say, it gives us a reasonable bit of space, as you can see from the middle of the guidance bracket to the bottom end to see how things are shaping up as the quarter actually progresses. So I think – I mean to be honest, I think it’s – I wouldn’t say on our software streams – I mean, I’m not going to be giving a big indicator here, but it’s mostly turning out as we’d expect. It looks solid in the quarter ahead. So that’s probably the best answer.  I don’t think it was significant one way or another in the fourth quarter. But yes, it is softer than Q4 last year, which we realize, but that comes down to the fact, not only that we had a strong first half last year, but if you remember last quarter, we got XP big orders, which we didn’t expect. So I think we’re effectively flattish; yearend – year-over-year flatness for SP revenues and confident, frankly for that growing next quarter. No, highly unlikely. Ryan mentioned, we’ve done a lot of beta testing with customers on both that and the Daytona release as well. In fact, Daytona was sort of forced to go quicker because of some of the key large customer solutions basically asked for a time when we got pushed to go quicker, but a point being up for RM has not been an issue as such. No, we haven’t seen trademark thing coming into single huge opportunity yet. I mean, we continue to be focused on providing the market with as much flexibility as we can. And it’s no different with the NFV, but at the same time – I mean, we’re just trying to make our products as flexible as possible to deal with whatever the market’s going to throw at us. NFV has been at the forefront in terms of at least, as has IoT. In fact, we’re less specific in certain areas. We have done very well in certain areas and in particularly the service provider area, but outside of that, it’s not been significant. As soon as we do, we will actually report that to you. And we’re on. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, this concludes the F5 Networks Q1 2017 earnings conference call. Thank you and have a great day.
