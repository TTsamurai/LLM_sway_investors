 to give you a definitive answer, but it’s of the biggest of our years. On the first question, the second quarter traditionally is the strongest quarter of the year for F5, so that’s why we’re indicating that a possible growth in product revenue year-over-year and then keeping the pattern going in the second half of FY17. We see product sales in the Americas and in APAC regions as growing well and being solid. EMEA is still a bit of a struggle, so we’re taking a conservative stance on that. In terms of software sales, our performance has been strong and we expect to exit FY17 at a $400 million annual trajectory for software sales, based on the current growth momentum. On the second question, our product roadmap for fiscal 2017 is going to introduce exciting new products, specifically focusing on security solutions. The new Herculon product family with purpose-built hardware and simplified user experience aims to swiftly deploy solutions that address specific application security challenges. The Herculon SSL Orchestrator and DDoS defender are the first two products to be launched in this family. The Silverline WAF Express service and our Silverline scrubbing centers will also be offered as tools to enhance web application security as a service and mitigate attacks. Furthermore, we will also roll out TMOS 13.0, known as the Daytona release, in this quarter. This major release includes new functionality such as support for 40-gig virtualization, iApp optimization for SSL Orchestrator, and IoT/MQTT protocol support. Additionally, we plan to deliver our unique application connector solution in Q2, which will allow customer applications to access multiple public cloud infrastructures. Lastly, our container microservices-based solution known as Project Velcro is planned to be launched soon and is expected to enable a new category of F5 solutions for private and public cloud environments. Thank you. As a conclusion, we believe that with the product sales growth in Americas and APAC, the solid performance of software sales, and the introduction of an exciting new product roadmap for fiscal 2017, F5 is well-positioned for increased year-over-year product revenue in Q2 and beyond. Thank you.
