. Thank you for participating in our earnings call today. We appreciate your time and your thoughtful questions. We understand that the outlook for our company may be cause for skepticism or caution, especially in light of the decline in sales and profit over the past year. Based on the information we have shared today, we understand if you have reservations about investing in Caterpillar, Inc. Given the challenges we have faced and the uncertainty about future economic growth, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance at this time. We will continue to focus on cost reduction and restructuring to improve our performance, but we understand if you choose to approach our company with caution. Thank you again for your participation, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the future.
