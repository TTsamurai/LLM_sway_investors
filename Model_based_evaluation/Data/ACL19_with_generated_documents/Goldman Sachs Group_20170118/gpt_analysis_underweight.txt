Thank you, Dane. Good morning, everyone. As we reported in our earnings release, the fourth quarter of 2015 was challenging and our results reflect that. Our net revenues were down 5% year-over-year, driven by lower net revenues in Investment Banking, Institutional Client Services and Investment Management. Our expenses also increased due to higher compensation and benefits costs.

Looking ahead, we are facing a number of headwinds that are likely to impact our performance. In Investment Banking, we anticipate continued market volatility and uncertainty, which could lead to lower deal activity and underwriting revenues. In Institutional Client Services, we are expecting lower client activity and trading volumes, as well as a competitive environment that may put pressure on our margins. In Investment Management, we are monitoring market trends and investor sentiment, which could affect our asset management fees and performance.

In addition, we are also mindful of the regulatory and compliance challenges that we continue to face, which could result in higher costs and operational burdens. While we are taking steps to address these challenges, there is still uncertainty around the ultimate impact on our financial results.

Given these factors, we believe that it is prudent to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on Goldman Sachs. We recommend closely monitoring the company's performance and reassessing the investment position as the market conditions evolve. The risks and uncertainties highlighted in our earnings conference call transcript, as well as the potential impact on key financial metrics such as net revenues, expenses, and regulatory compliance, reinforce our cautious outlook for the company.
