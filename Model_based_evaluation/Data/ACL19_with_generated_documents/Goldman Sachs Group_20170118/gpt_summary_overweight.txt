 Thank you, Dane. Hello, everyone. This is Harvey Schwartz, Chief Financial Officer of Goldman Sachs. I'll begin by providing an overview of our key financial metrics for the fourth quarter.

Firstly, I want to highlight our strong earnings performance. Our earnings per share for the quarter were $5.08, exceeding analyst expectations and representing a significant increase from the same period last year. This strong performance is driven by robust revenue growth across our investment banking, securities, and asset management divisions. Our investment banking transaction backlog remains strong, indicating a healthy pipeline of future business.

Secondly, our capital ratios and risk-weighted assets are in line with regulatory requirements, demonstrating the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to manage risk effectively. Our global core liquid assets and supplementary leverage ratio also remain healthy, providing a solid foundation for future growth and investment opportunities.

In addition, we continue to focus on disciplined expense management, optimizing our cost structure to enhance our overall profitability. Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect this disciplined approach, and we encourage investors to review the full details on our website.

Overall, we are confident in our ability to deliver strong financial performance and create value for our shareholders. We remain optimistic about the opportunities ahead and believe that our 'overweight' investment stance is justified based on our solid financial metrics and strong earnings outlook.

I'll now hand over to Marty Chavez to provide more detailed insights into our financial results. Thank you.
