Thank you, Dane. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. I will start by providing an overview of our financial performance and then turn it over to Marty to discuss some key business drivers.

In the fourth quarter, we reported net revenues of $7.27 billion, reflecting a sequential decline from the third quarter. We also saw a decrease in net earnings, with diluted earnings per share of $4.68. Our return on equity for the quarter was 9.1%, down from the previous quarter.

Looking at our full year performance, we achieved net revenues of $33.82 billion, with net earnings of $5.56 billion and diluted earnings per share of $12.14. Our return on equity for the year was 11.2%.

Now, turning to our key business drivers, we saw a decline in investment banking revenues in the fourth quarter, driven by lower advisory and underwriting activity. Additionally, our fixed income, currency, and commodities business experienced a decrease in revenues, reflecting challenging market conditions.

In light of these financial metrics and our performance in the fourth quarter, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on Goldman Sachs. We believe that the uncertain nature of the market and the challenging business environment may continue to impact the firm's future results. In particular, the decline in investment banking revenues and fixed income, currency, and commodities business raises concerns about the firm's ability to generate sustainable growth and profitability.

In conclusion, we urge investors to carefully consider the risks and factors that could affect Goldman Sachs' future results before making investment decisions. Thank you for your attention, and we are now available to take your questions.
