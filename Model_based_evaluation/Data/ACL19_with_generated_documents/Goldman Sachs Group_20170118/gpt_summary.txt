Starting with the key financial metrics, for the fourth quarter, we reported net revenues of $9.96 billion, a 23% increase from the same period last year. Our net earnings for the quarter were $2.32 billion, resulting in diluted earnings per share of $6.04.

In terms of our key business segments, our Investment Banking division had a strong performance in the fourth quarter, with net revenues of $2.06 billion, driven by higher advisory and underwriting revenues. Our Global Markets division also delivered solid results, with net revenues of $3.48 billion, reflecting strong performance across fixed income, currency, and commodities, as well as equity trading.

In addition, our Asset Management and Consumer & Wealth Management divisions also contributed positively to our overall performance, with net revenues of $2.77 billion and $1.65 billion, respectively.

We continue to maintain a strong capital position, with our global core liquid assets at $271 billion and our supplementary leverage ratio at 5.5%.

In conclusion, we are pleased with our strong financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year 2019. We remain focused on delivering value to our shareholders and clients, and we are confident in our ability to navigate the uncertain economic and market conditions.
