Thank you, Dane. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'll start by providing an overview of our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year, and then Marty will provide some additional detail on our financial results. After that, we'll open up the line for questions.

As you may have seen from our earnings release this morning, we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $8.17 billion, and net earnings of $2.35 billion. For the full year, our net revenues were $37.71 billion, and net earnings were $10.48 billion. These results reflect a strong finish to the year, driven by solid performance across our businesses.

In Investment Banking, we continued to see robust activity, particularly in equity underwriting and mergers and acquisitions. Our Institutional Client Services division also had a strong quarter, with improved performance in both fixed income and equities. Our Investing and Lending segment saw positive results, driven by gains in public and private equity investments.

Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about our prospects for growth and profitability. We believe that our diverse business mix, strong risk management practices, and commitment to client service will continue to drive value for our shareholders.

In terms of our outlook, we are confident in our ability to deliver strong results in the coming year. We see opportunities for growth in both established and emerging markets, and we are well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities. Additionally, we continue to focus on enhancing efficiency and productivity across our firm, which we believe will further strengthen our competitive position.

In conclusion, we believe that Goldman Sachs is well-positioned to deliver attractive returns for our shareholders in the future. We remain committed to executing our strategy and delivering value for our clients, and we are confident in our ability to generate sustainable, long-term growth.

With that, I'll turn it over to Marty for a more detailed review of our financial results. Thank you.
