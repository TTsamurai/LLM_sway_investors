Thank you, Dane. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter earnings conference call. I am pleased to report that Goldman Sachs had a strong performance in the fourth quarter, with net revenues of $8.17 billion, net earnings of $1.67 billion, and earnings per common share of $4.68. Our return on equity for the quarter was 11.4%. Our Investment Banking division had a particularly strong quarter, with net revenues of $2.01 billion, driven by higher levels of M&A and underwriting activity. Our Fixed Income, Currency, and Commodities division also had a solid performance, with net revenues of $2.12 billion. We continue to focus on managing our expenses, and our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 64.8%. Looking ahead, we remain focused on delivering value to our clients and shareholders, and we are confident in our ability to generate strong returns in the future. Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to a successful 2016. Now, I will turn the call back over to Dane for the Q&A portion. Thank you.
