Based on the financial metrics from the recent earnings conference call transcript, it appears that Otis, Climate, Controls & Security, and Aerospace Systems are all showing positive growth and profitability trends.

For Otis, although operating profit was down 7% at constant currency, there is still a 2% organic growth in sales and new equipment sales were up 2%. Despite the decline in orders, the full-year expectations remain unchanged. This indicates stability in the company's performance going forward.

Climate, Controls & Security (CCS) saw a 6% sales growth and 5% profit growth in the quarter. Additionally, the company is confident in delivering low to mid-single digit organic sales growth for the full year, with operating profit growth likely to be towards the low end of the $100 million to $150 million range at actual FX. It shows strong growth potential in the upcoming periods.

Aerospace Systems delivered 4% profit growth on flat organic sales, driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket sales, continued cost reduction, and pension tailwind. The company expects operating profit to be up $50 million to $100 million for the full year, indicating a positive outlook for profitability.

Based on these insights and metrics, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended for the company as it shows promising growth and profitability prospects across its segments.
