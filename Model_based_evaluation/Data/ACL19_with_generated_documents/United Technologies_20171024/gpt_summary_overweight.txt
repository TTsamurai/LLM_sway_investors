Dear stakeholders,

Following a thorough review of the recent earnings conference call transcript, we are pleased to present a detailed summary report that supports an 'overweight' investment stance in the company. Our focus will be on key financial metrics in the three main segments discussed in the transcript: Otis, Climate Controls & Security (CCS), and Aerospace (Pratt & Whitney and Aerospace Systems).

Starting with Otis, we note that the segment achieved sales of $3.2 billion in the quarter, representing a 2% organic growth. However, operating profit was down 7% at constant currency, mainly due to pricing and mix pressure in China and strategic investments in service and E&D. Despite the decline in operating profit, foreign exchange translation provided a 1 point tailwind to sales and earnings. New equipment sales and service sales saw positive growth, offset by a decline in new equipment orders. Nevertheless, we maintain our full-year expectations for Otis, with the anticipation of operating profit being down $125 million to $175 million at actual FX.

Moving on to Climate Controls & Security, the segment exhibited strong sales growth of 6% in the quarter, with a 5% organic growth. The segment saw promising performance in every major product segment, including commercial refrigeration, transport refrigeration, residential HVAC, and global commercial HVAC. Total equipment orders at CCS were up 2% in the quarter, and we remain confident that the segment will deliver low to mid-single digit organic sales growth with operating profit growth at the low end of the $100 million to $150 million range at actual FX for the full year.

In the aerospace sector, Pratt & Whitney delivered robust sales growth, with a 15% increase organically in the quarter. This was primarily attributed to higher Geared Turbofan deliveries and favorable mix on legacy programs. Commercial OEM sales showed a 31% growth, driven by favorable commercial aftermarket sales and military engines business. Despite the increase in sales, operating profit was up 2%, with drop-through from the commercial aftermarket being offset by negative engine margin and ramp-related costs. The company expects full-year operating profit to be down $125 million to $175 million, but likely closer to the $125 million end of the range, showing an improvement over prior expectations.

Aerospace Systems reported 4% profit growth on flat organic sales. Commercial OEM sales were down 6% due to declines in legacy program volume, with the end of the Boeing 777 landing gear production impacting sales. However, commercial aftermarket saw a significant growth of 11%, driven by provisioning, parts, and repair. With solid year-to-date results, we anticipate operating profit to be up $50 million to $100 million for the full year, likely towards the high end of the range on low single-digit organic sales growth.

In conclusion, despite the challenges faced by Otis and Aerospace, the overall performance of the company across the segments exhibits promising growth potential. Therefore, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance, based on the positive financial metrics presented in the recent earnings conference call transcript.

Sincerely,
