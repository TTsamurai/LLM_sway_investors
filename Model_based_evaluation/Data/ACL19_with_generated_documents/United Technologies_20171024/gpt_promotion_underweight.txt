, we're seeing some of those operators also convert to the GTF, so we're optimistic about the long-term prospects there. 

Based on the recent earnings call, it is clear that the company is facing challenges in its Otis segment, with declining orders and operating profit. The Chinese market remains challenging, with a 10% decline in new equipment sales and a 24% decline in orders in North America. Additionally, while Climate, Controls & Security saw some growth, it also faced headwinds in price and mix, and residential HVAC orders declined after seeing double-digit growth earlier in the year. 

In Aerospace, while Pratt & Whitney saw strong sales, the operating profit was impacted by higher negative engine margin and ramp-related costs. Aerospace Systems also faced challenges with declining commercial OEM sales and a negative impact from the end of Boeing 777 landing gear production. 

Overall, the company's recent earnings call reflects a mixed performance across its segments, with challenges in key markets and product segments. As a result, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company.
