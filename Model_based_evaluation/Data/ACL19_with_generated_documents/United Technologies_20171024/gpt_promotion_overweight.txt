 a higher content across some of the widebody programs as well. So really good data points coming out of the aftermarket there. Thanks, Bob. And with that, let's open it up for Q&A. Thank you for the detailed updates, team. Based on the recent earnings call, it is clear that the company's segments are showing signs of growth and improvement. Otis, despite some challenges in China, has seen an increase in sales and solid growth in modernization and repair. Climate, Controls & Security has also seen growth in every major product segment, with expectations for continued growth in operating profit. Aerospace, particularly Pratt & Whitney, has shown strong sales and operating profit growth, driven by commercial aftermarket sales and continued cost reduction. 

Given the positive outlook across all segments, I recommend an overweight investment stance on the company. With a focus on continued growth and improvement in the segments, the company is poised for future success and increased profitability. Investors should consider increasing their investment in the company based on the strong performance and potential for future growth.
