Based on the company's recent earnings call, there are several reasons to be cautious or skeptical about Waste Management as an investment. Despite the company's positive financial and operating quarter, there are some warning signs that investors should be aware of. The impact of hurricanes, particularly in Texas and Florida, has had a significant effect on the company's operations. The temporary suspension of recycling programs in those areas has resulted in a decline in tons sold and has negatively impacted the company's recycling earnings.

Furthermore, the announcement by China to ban certain materials from import in 2018 has put the global recycling industry in a bind. Waste Management has been forced to find alternative markets for materials due to the ban, and recycling earnings are expected to decline in 2018, with significant impacts in the first half of the year.

Additionally, the new role of Chief Digital Officer has been created to focus on leveraging technology to grow the business and improve customer service. While this may indicate a forward-thinking approach, it also suggests that the company may be facing challenges in these areas that require significant attention.

Overall, these factors lead to a recommendation of an 'underweight' investment stance on Waste Management. The potential impact of the hurricanes, the challenges in the recycling industry, and the emphasis on technology all suggest that the company may face headwinds in the near future. It is important for investors to carefully consider these factors before making any investment decisions.
