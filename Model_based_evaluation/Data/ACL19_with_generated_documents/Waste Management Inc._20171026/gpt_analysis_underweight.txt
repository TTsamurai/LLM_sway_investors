Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, Waste Management has reported impressive financial performance for the third quarter of 2017. Both operating EBITDA and free cash flow have shown significant growth, with EBITDA increasing by 7% to $1.071 billion, and free cash flow rising by over 18% compared to the same period in 2016. The company is also raising its full-year free cash flow guidance to a new range of $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion.

Earnings per share (EPS) for the third quarter grew by 7.1% year-over-year and the company is raising its full-year 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share. Revenue growth of 4.7% was driven by yield and volume growth in traditional solid waste business and the recycling line of business.

However, the recycling operations have been impacted by commodity price pressure, with the company expecting a negative $0.03 impact in the fourth quarter and a $0.04 decline in recycling earnings in 2018, heavily weighted to the first half of the year. Waste Management anticipates challenges in the recycling market due to China's ban on certain materials and the impact of alternative markets for recycled materials.

The company also announced the promotion of Nikolaj Sjoqvist to the new role of Chief Digital Officer, emphasizing the importance of data, analytics, and customer insights in their digital strategy. Waste Management has seen strong margins and operating cost efficiencies, and is confident in the growth prospects of the business.

Overall, Waste Management has demonstrated strong financial performance, but the challenges in the recycling market and uncertainties in future commodity prices warrant an 'underweight' investment stance. It will be important to closely monitor the company's ability to navigate these challenges and the impact on its financial performance in the coming quarters.
