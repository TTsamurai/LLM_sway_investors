Based on these key financial metrics, an 'overweight' investment stance can be adopted for Waste Management due to its strong financial performance, growth in EBITDA and free cash flow, and focus on leveraging technology and analytics to drive business growth and operational efficiency. Despite potential challenges in the recycling business and the impact of hurricanes, the company's proactive approach and focus on margin expansion opportunities support a positive investment outlook.
