Based on the recent earnings call, Waste Management is showing impressive growth in their operating EBITDA, free cash flow, and EPS. The company's revenue grew by 4.7%, primarily driven by yield and volume growth in their traditional solid waste business. Despite challenges in the recycling business due to commodity price pressure and impact from hurricanes, Waste Management is raising its full-year guidance for free cash flow and adjusted earnings per share.

Waste Management's Chief Digital Officer, Nikolaj Sjoqvist, has been promoted to lead the company's digital strategy, leveraging data, analytics, and customer insights to drive growth and efficiency. The company has achieved strong operating cost efficiency and expects continued margin improvement in EBITDA and free cash flow.

The company remains optimistic about future growth and is confident in its ability to mitigate the impact of market fluctuations. Despite the challenges from natural disasters and recycling market conditions, Waste Management's strong performance in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2017 positions the company for continued success in 2018.

Given the solid growth and performance demonstrated by Waste Management, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. Their consistent focus on efficiency, revenue growth, and strong leadership in the digital strategy make Waste Management an attractive investment opportunity.
