The company reported earnings per share of $1.07 for the fourth quarter and $5.70 for the full year, which is roughly in line with the previous year's results. However, there were three notable items that adversely affected earnings per share by $0.11, including the impact of Hurricane Irma on the Parks business, the cancellation of the animated film Gigantic, and a valuation adjustment at BAMTech.

At Parks and Resorts, operating income increased by 7% in the quarter due to growth at international operations, but was offset by lower operating income at domestic operations, primarily due to the impact of Hurricane Irma. The hurricane caused the closure of Walt Disney World Parks for two days and the cancellation of three Disney Cruise Line itineraries, resulting in a $100 million impact on operating income.

Media Networks experienced lower operating income in the fourth quarter, largely due to lower equity income and a decline in Broadcasting. However, cable operating income was comparable to the previous year. ESPN saw growth in affiliate revenue offset by higher programming costs and lower advertising revenue.

The studio reported higher film cost impairments and lower operating income from television distribution, but operating income in theatrical and home entertainment businesses was comparable to the previous year.

Operating income at Consumer Products & Interactive Media was lower in the quarter due to a decrease in merchandise licensing business.

The company repurchased 33.6 million shares for $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter and plans to repurchase $6 billion in stock for fiscal 2018. They also expect consolidated CapEx to increase by about $1 billion in 2018, largely due to investments in Parks and Resorts, including the construction of two Star Wars Lands.

In fiscal 2018, earnings growth is expected to be suppressed by the consolidation of BAMTech, increased losses from the equity investment in Hulu, and a timing issue related to the recognition of minimum guarantee shortfall revenue at Consumer Products.

Overall, the company remains confident in its investments and expects to deploy capital in a balanced way, whether it's through investment in its businesses, supporting its direct-to-consumer strategy, or returning capital to shareholders.
