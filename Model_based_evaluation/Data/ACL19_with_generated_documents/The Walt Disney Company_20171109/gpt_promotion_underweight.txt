Based on the company's recent earnings call, the operating income and earnings per share for the fourth quarter and full year were adversely affected by several notable items, including the impact of Hurricane Irma on the Parks business, the cancellation of the animated film Gigantic, and a valuation adjustment at BAMTech. As a result, the company's operating income at domestic operations was lower, and the impact of Hurricane Irma reduced the total segment operating income by approximately $275 million.

Additionally, the Media Networks' lower operating income was a result of lower equity income and declining advertising revenue at cable networks like ESPN. Furthermore, the Studio's operating income was affected by higher film cost impairments and lower revenue share from Consumer Products.

For fiscal 2018, the company expects its earnings growth to be suppressed by the consolidation of BAMTech and its ongoing investment, increased equity losses from Hulu, and a timing issue related to the recognition of minimum guarantee shortfall revenue at Consumer Products.

The company also plans to increase its capital expenditures by approximately $1 billion, with a significant portion of the investment going towards the completion of the two Star Wars Lands and Toy Story Land in Orlando.

In conclusion, based on the information provided in the earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company due to the adverse impacts on operating income and future earnings growth.
