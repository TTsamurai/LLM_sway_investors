Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, the company's fiscal year 2017 results were impacted by three major events - Hurricane Irma, the cancelation of the animated film Gigantic, and a valuation adjustment to sports programming rights at BAMTech. These events reduced earnings per share by about $0.11. In terms of operating income at Parks and Resorts, international operations saw an increase while domestic operations were lower, largely due to the impact of Hurricane Irma. At Media Networks, lower operating income was due to lower equity income and a decline in broadcasting. Cable operating income was impacted by the consolidation of BAMTech, and consumer products and interactive media segment operating income was lower. The company has plans to invest in the future, particularly at Parks and Resorts, with CapEx expected to increase by about $1 billion. The company also plans to repurchase $6 billion in stock for fiscal 2018. Overall, the company expects earnings growth to be somewhat suppressed in fiscal 2018 due to the consolidation of BAMTech and increased investment in the business.  This information supports an "underweight" investment stance for the company, as its current financial outlook for 2018 is less favorable compared to previous years due to various adverse impacts and the need for increased investment.
