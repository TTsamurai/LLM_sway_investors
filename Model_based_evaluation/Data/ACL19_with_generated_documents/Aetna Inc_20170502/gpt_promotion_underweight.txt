 with the individual Medicare Advantage product. So we're really pleased with that. As we talked about last year – and then I guess the primary driver of the pricing, as Jim mentioned, is really – continues to be what we've talked about a lot, the upward pressure on specialty pharmacy. And as I mentioned in my remarks, most of that is already built into our projections and rate increases as they were submitted for these products. But of course, there's always some delay and timing and what eventually gets approved in the market. So we always keep that as a watchout. So I will say this, to Karen: she has done a fantastic job in terms of responding to what's required from a customer service standpoint and even really from an operational standpoint. So those are the two things I'd add in there. I think the – it'll be interesting to see it's – as you can see from the script, the performance from a margin standpoint is really one of the things that we were pretty pleased with in the quarter. It's a kind of cohort of 41,000 members After the quarter ends, plans are typically re-adjudicated based on the experience from that quarter and new plans that are issued for the next quarter or year based on that. So the initial portrait is, as Jim said, look pretty good from the standpoint of obviously a much fewer members, a higher cost that we already reflected. And I would hope and expect to see that continue to move in the right direction. On the provider network adequacy, that’s something we keep a very close eye on. So as we’ve talked about, when the ACA made some changes in terms of – put in rules about access to care, the states then really focused on that and started to enforce it. And that really is the positive, the silver lining of the exchange business. Yes, Karen, it’s complex, as you know. I mean we think about our exit decisions and our offerings for 2018 every single year. We’re already well into that process, as we’ve disclosed. We’ll conclude and communicate those decisions as appropriate. I think I would say it this way, though, staying with the ACA for just one minute, generally we think about our exchange footprint in the context of also having the relationships with the states and those plans, right? And so actually – and I don’t have the number in front of me, but we actually do business across a lot more states than just the ones that have ACA footprint, so we feel good about the relationships and the ability to serve in the other parts of those states if that makes any sense. Justin, I think if you take a step back and think about the two large legislative initiatives or issues that are coming up, as you mentioned, tax reform, if there’s – obviously tax reform can take many forms and shapes, but tax reform will have an impact on our business one way or the other. So we obviously are studying that and already getting ready to understand – well, denominated, as you would guess, by a $1 billion of cash at the parent, so that’s capital that can be deployed in the market. We’ll talk about that at our Investor Update Meeting and decisions that come out of that will certainly influence our final share count at the end of the year. Then, on top of that, as we’ve talked about, we’re still acquiring a significant amount of our excess earnings that come through the year from the subs and the dividend up. So those are sort of our two primary sources and then how much and when and how we deploy back into the market. I would say that we see the $4 billion that we’ve talked about before as pretty consistent with December Johnson. That’s in a pay position mostly originated with repricings and some account loss. And then the $0.10 headwind that’s mostly an anomaly from the recovery of the health insurer fee. That’s largely what we’re expecting there. Provider fees generally affect both the expense ratio in the near-term and then also the premium yield over time. So what I would say, for the most part, we have put in contractually that – embedded in that margin assumption that probably what you need to have for a reasonable expectation on a paid basis would be models that represent roughly 90% tiered or narrow and 10% broad. So we certainly think that we have the right membership mix represented in our pricing. Again, Karen, I mean this goes back to the fundamental importance that we’ve placed on ensuring that when the ACA was implemented that we had network access and appropriate network balances. That continues today. We have a very robust network strategy and built that in every state and for every plan. In the ACA position, those plans are all tiered at the narrow level. And so as you know, that’s really a very high standard in terms of network, and so – and that’s in every product now that we offer. So I think it’s fair to say like with everything, we’re watching the current discussions and we’re hoping to shore up the current contracts, relationships, and make sure that continues to meet the standards that we have or exceed them. And that’s ongoing work. Let me switch gears just for one second too, because you had a couple of specifics. On small group, we made some adjustments in terms of the pricing and products that we bring to the market at the beginning of the year. I’d say that those products have performed very well for example in January and – in January, February, and so we’re feeling pretty good with the ASO product offering and what we’ve brought to market, and that seems to have landed well with the group market. Most of the claims payment cycles or at least almost all of our business that we’ve written has that level of performance guarantee in there, so it’s – I mean it’s a big deal. It’s stuff that we’re very diligent about, an area of real focus and, as Jim said, an area that we were – had very good performance in the quarter. On the property and casualty books, we sometimes talk about undiscounted claims liability as a percentage of surplus, so that’s basically looking at sort of the traditional property and casualty calculations for how we look at this, and we look at that each quarter. And we’re far enough away, really, from those that I would say that the feedback we’ve tended to have is always that in the first quarter and a few other times during the year, that’s a high volume period for P&C claims, and those – those figures tend to move around a little bit from quarter to quarter, so I don’t think there’s anything really unusual to say there. Again, I think the important thing is the extremely high marks that we’ve gotten from ’16 especially. Let me highlight – I think probably most people know that along with working with our providers and setting reimbursement rates for deliveries and joint replacement, the DRG weight, which is the payment weight, is also established by a third body, Medicare. So that changes on every October 1. And setting reimbursement rates is highly connected with the subsequent DRG weight and what is allowed is sort of allocated proportionally. I will say we have a voice, that voice is electronic. So we – so it’s not a personal voice, but we are allowed to submit information around those. What I would say is that that rating was distributed in 2016 also, and we have not seen anything for 2017 that would speak against that. So we continue to feel very good about getting our high ratings there. On the pharmacy side, generally we’re looking at high single digits again, I think, is what occurred in the first quarter. So again, we’ll have to look with the drug categorizes. A couple of things: you could certainly make a case in terms of primary – of looking at some of the pressure around the co-pays and formulary management and things like that. But a lot of this is really tied to the pipeline of drugs and drugs that come off patent and generics that get introduced. And so – I mean there’s just a lot of complexity around the pharma side. And as I’ve mentioned more than once, and I think we’ll just continue to mention it because the share that specialty pharma is taking in the total cost is really important to know now. I would anticipate as we move going forward we’ll continue to see partnership between us and our clients and other industry players on addressing those issues. So that said, I’m very happy with where we ended the quarter. That’s the summary finish of the comments. I know Karen likes to comment on the moderated medical trends. I’ll hand it to her. So let me talk about – so we – I just want to reiterate why the new guidance didn’t include any reserve development. The $0.30 to $0.35 is what we’ve seen in the first quarter. So when we said that the General Commercial business delivered better-than-expected results, that was not the PYD. The PYD, we think, will still happen within the subsequent quarters in the same way that we’ve seen historically. From a pricing standpoint, Karen, most of our products that we’re talking about for the 2017 year are rate guaranteed for the year, and so we’re not terribly affected by that bill. It’s certainly one of the issues that we’re keeping a close eye on in terms of any kind of opportunities or challenges that it could present. So, really, I think the overall answer is we felt good about what we’ve already submitted to the relevant states for rate.

Based on the content of the earnings call, there are several red flags and concerns that point towards a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company, Aetna. Here are some reasons for recommending an 'underweight' investment stance:

1. Membership Decline: The individual Commercial membership declined significantly during the first quarter, and the company expects attrition throughout the remainder of 2017. This signals a potential risk to revenue and profitability, especially considering the significant membership decline.

2. Higher-than-anticipated Medical Costs: The company faced headwinds related to profitability due to higher membership and an updated view of the health status of the current membership, resulting in a $110 million premium deficiency reserve. This suggests challenges in managing medical costs and profitability, which could impact future earnings.

3. Uncertainty in Outlook: The company's updated 2017 guidance is influenced by certain risks, including potential increases in medical cost trends and low visibility into achieving the updated outlook for individual Commercial products. This uncertainty indicates potential challenges in meeting financial projections.

4. Impact of Legislative Initiatives: The company is closely monitoring the potential impact of legislative initiatives, such as tax reform, on its business. This suggests uncertainty and potential volatility in future earnings due to external factors beyond the company's control.

5. Continued High Costs of Specialty Pharma: The high costs of specialty pharmaceuticals continue to be a significant driver of medical cost trends and could impact the company's profitability.

Overall, the company's earnings call raises several concerns and uncertainties, which warrant a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company's financial outlook and performance. Therefore, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance towards Aetna based on the content of the recent earnings call.
