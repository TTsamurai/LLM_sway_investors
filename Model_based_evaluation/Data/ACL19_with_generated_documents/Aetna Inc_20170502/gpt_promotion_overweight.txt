Summary:
- The company reported strong first quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $939 million and adjusted earnings per share of $2.71, representing year-over-year growth of 14% and 17%, respectively.
- Medical membership of 22.4 million is higher than previously projected, driven by better-than-anticipated commercial growth and lower-than-projected Medicaid declines.

- The government business had strong performance, with solid growth in premiums and Medicare membership, partially offset by Medicaid membership declines.
- The commercial business also showed strong momentum, with an increase in commercial ASC membership, but a decrease in individual business membership, resulting in a $110 million premium deficiency reserve.
- The company is confident in its long-term growth prospects and plans to continue investing in growth initiatives in Medicare, Medicaid, and geographic expansion.
- The company increased its 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $8.80 to $9 per share, reflecting favorable first quarter results, and the impact of an accelerated share repurchase program.
- Significant investments are planned for the future to drive growth in 2018 and beyond.
- Despite challenges in the individual commercial products, the company is on an improved earnings trajectory.
- The company plans to provide 2018 guidance later this year and continue evaluating its footprint in individual commercial products.

Recommendation:
Based on the strong first quarter results and the company's improved 2017 outlook, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company's positive performance in its government and commercial businesses, strong cash flow and balance sheet, increased adjusted earnings per share guidance, and planned investments for future growth all contribute to a compelling case for an overweight investment stance. Additionally, continuation of strong cost trends and favorable prior years reserve development indicate a positive outlook for the company's financial performance in the coming quarters.
