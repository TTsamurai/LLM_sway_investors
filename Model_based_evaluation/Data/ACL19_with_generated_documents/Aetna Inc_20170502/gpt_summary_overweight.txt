 in the Commercial ASC business. And so there's fixed costs to run after – Karen mentioned earlier got a fixed cost of that business for the most part, so the unit revenue growth really fell right through to the bottom line. Some – I mean again, I preface it all by saying, the small group certainly seems to be abating quite nicely. And, Chris, just a reminder. It was late last year that we filed for that rate. It really hit in the middle of the year when we were just anticipating a larger fee. And for all the reasons that Karen stated, we're really going to have to study this very closely. It's not even just the data, but it's the competitive dynamic as well as what will happen with the subsidy. So a cautious outlook at this point in time. As is always the case, the change in prospective policy norm changes what we do. But certainly, as we know, not a great history with us or within the industry. So a little more of the latter in terms of 2018 and those investments. And so overall investing more. But as A.J. mentioned, the overall broad framework in terms of the drivers of what we knew understand about the business seems to be in good shape. So overall, again, I think just a little bit more – a little bit more groovy in terms of we've seen the first quarter and, with all the caveats, even what we've seen after that point in time, I think, is generally moving in the right direction for us. Yeah. I think Medicare was $7.1 billion. And a lot in the very first quarter related to the Nebraska and Pennsylvania Medicaid actions really representing our 2017 footprint actions. Really now, as we look forward, not a lot of additional large things or large decisions anticipated, at least at this point in time. Good. And I think, Karen, have you said 3% to 5% on the script counts for that? On the script per member, we have not given specific numbers, and I don't have those at hand. But as we talked all through the early part of the year and especially last year, we saw a combination of the medical side of the business – the utilization, the pricing all being part of the story. And as related to the first quarter, very much a continuation of that story going forward. So, Chris, if I read the first quarter right, combination of what we are seeing in terms of script counts, the pricing seems to be, again, very consistent with the trajectory that we've talked about and historical numbers. So a continued good trajectory in that part of the story. So, Karen, 85% for Government? I'm sorry, I missed that one. Yes. That's right. That's overall. Now some states are different now, based on different methodologies. But we think the overall PDR that we had in the quarter is representative of what is a pretty diverse and large population in those products and so a pretty good proxy. And so really, based on actual membership and actual results and actual people, we would say that this is probably a good spot in terms of where we stand with that. The provisional period ends certainly later in the year. And so we continue to monitor that closely. And as Joe mentioned, when we think about investment, we think about using our money in many cases to drive future growth as we've said has been a pretty good proxy for 17. So the base period itself ends pretty early and so a lot of this is really 2016 business. But again, we continue to be a little bit uncertain about 2017, with the early part of the year, but certainly, understanding that the base period has improved relative to our – some of our models. And especially to your point, Chris, based on what we understand about the population. The PDR all regards to that. And obviously, these – the levels of disparity that you see – we've talked about this quarters and going forward is a function of the initial premiums that were – risk-adjusted premiums that were put in place. So as – to your point, as we get more mature and get on the other side of the provisional period, we're watching things pretty closely. But also, as A.J. talked very coursework, we are spending more money, particularly that gap in the commercial business, which is still a profit enhancement business for us. And from a progamatic, raw result kind of point of view, that's a big part of what let us get to that higher range of earnings onc. And from a commercial business really within the successful margins of our target margin range, that's been a good thing. And I would say sort of generally in line with what A.J. talked about, and certainly in line with our targeted – in line with our targeted margins for the most part. Let me say I think that when you look at those business lines in aggregate, we feel like we're in a good spot. We are doing cartwheels in terms of where those books are, both in terms of the utilization and the price. So as I've said before, when you think about the lines of business, especially in commercial is a good story. Joe! One of the clear big potentially – or one of the big potentially problematic risks that we think about a lot is what happened to that small business segment because the margins are not that fantastic on a pure basis in that case, relative to the long-term projection that we have for that business. So certainly, that's something that we're keeping an eye on. As to the post-bailing, I think we all know that as early as we are right now in the year, there are a lot of blanks to it, including the ones that you mentioned in terms of the potential impact of the warping we anticipate that. We continue to anticipate that. And so we think – as we mentioned post it's – a little bit out affordable comparisons, but at arm's-length in terms of that change. Again, good. And again, I think I would be – I'm confident about our Medicaid book, continuing to represent a solid double-digit growth vehicle for us as we see. Just as a programatist, we leave about $500 million on the table this year. So generally, not a big deal to be – for now. I think I've said before, it's when we bake this all into the forecast as we think about what our future profitability – this makes it a very stable proposition. And then you have to add into that the individual product, which is always going to be full of surprises, but clearly much improved for the most part for this year. So when we think about for level, given some of the underlying numbers, I think this is a quite a rational place to be. And based on the numbers, our profit and – we're basically strategic in that story. So that's what I feel like we consistently and quite rationally reflect the progression. So – so from a capital deployment and investments for future growth point of view, I think we're in a pretty good place. So, from an expense perspective, organic spending is – suppose, if you were to compare it to the actual number in the first quarter, you would see that some of those things, notably advertising and other direct expenses, were lower than – than we expected in the first quarter and what the annual look is going to be. We're also looking for a little bit of incrementality for MBO, but not a lot. As to the one-time nature of what we talk about and beginning the process of accelerating some spending, the fact that there were no EasyLease expenses and much lower CapEx in the first quarter actually – on a net-net basis, very late, that we did spend less money for 2017. So, just overall, again a good first quarter for us. And again, as Joe said earlier, we've made some decisions to accelerate some of our known and strategic growth in future growth areas and net-net spend more money in that process. So I think that all puts us in a good spot. Starting to gain some traction. Got some initial warnings really, and are starting to see some early wins on the Stars side and think that's a part of the story. So we were to allocate more of our investment spend against that and believe that was the rational decision that we made again. And as we think about that – so I think we'd focus on the fact that when we went through all of the decision analytics around the investment, we momentarily thought about how do we want to push a little bit more of our investment spending into the Medicare growth strategic initiatives for the year. So, for sure, some additional growth for those kinds of things, but I think we're in a really good place right now from that perspective. And from the cash flow and capital deployment point of view, we should remind that as we think about calculating from the parent up, we should say that we had about $900 million in – so we start with $15.1 billion and continually raised money and netted a few billion dollars. We repraised this quarter, we paid off our debt, including Humana; we had deal money and reversed our repurchase and dividend. So as a net-net effect, and so ended the quarter with about $100 million. And so let's not forget, as we think about our capital deployment position and our investment spending and what we have left at the end of the year, we feel pretty good about all that.
