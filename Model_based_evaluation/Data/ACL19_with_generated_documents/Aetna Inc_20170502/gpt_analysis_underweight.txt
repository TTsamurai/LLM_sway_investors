Dear colleagues,

After analyzing the recent earnings conference call transcript for Aetna, I have come to the conclusion that we should adopt an 'underweight' investment stance. Here are the key insights and financial metrics that have influenced this decision:

1. Despite reporting first quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $939 million and adjusted earnings per share of $2.71, the year-over-year growth of 14% and 17%, respectively, the adjusted revenue was $15.5 billion, a modest year-over-year decrease, driven by lower membership in ACA-compliant individual and small group products and the 2017 suspension of the health insurer fee.

2. The Commercial business faced headwinds related to profitability, with individual Commercial membership declining to 255,000 members, and a recognized $110 million Policy Deficiency Reserve reflecting the expectation for greater losses than previously anticipated for the 2017 policy year.

3. There is a significant decline in ACA-compliant individual and small group membership, leading to a greater-than-anticipated premium deficiency reserve and higher membership with higher cost levels than previously projected.

4. The updated 2017 guidance is influenced by risks such as the potential for the health insurer fee to be permanently repealed during 2017 and the ever-present concern that medical cost trends could increase more than projected.

5. The increased targeted investment spending to drive future growth, primarily related to government-sponsored programs, is expected to impact the adjusted expense ratio, increasing it to approximately 16.9% for the full year.

Given these key insights and financial metrics, it is clear that Aetna is facing challenges in their individual Commercial products and is making increased targeted investment spending, which could impact their expenses in the near future. The potential repeal of the health insurer fee and uncertainties in medical cost trends also pose risks to the company's financial outlook.

Therefore, I recommend adopting an 'underweight' investment stance for Aetna until there is more clarity on the impact of these challenges and risks on the company's financial performance.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
