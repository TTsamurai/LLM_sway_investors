As a stock promoter, I would recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Seagate based on the recent earnings call. The company's addressable HDD market was in line with their forecast, and they continue to drive sales of higher capacity products, leading to increased revenue and margin results for the quarter. Additionally, the company has implemented significant cost reduction activities, resulting in improvements in factory utilization and reductions in manufacturing costs and operating expenses. Seagate's strong cash flow generation and healthy balance sheet position them well to return to their long-term financial model. The company also remains confident in their ability to maintain higher-end margin and operating income margin targeted ranges for fiscal year 2017. Overall, the company's resilience and competitiveness in the marketplace, combined with their cost alignment activities and new high capacity products, make them an attractive investment opportunity.
