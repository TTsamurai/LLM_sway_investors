### Summary Report on Earnings Conference Call

#### Company Performance Overview:
The company experienced a significant shift in financial performance, reporting a net loss of $1.04 billion, or $4.06 per share this quarter, compared to a net income of $70.6 million, or $0.25 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. This change was primarily due to substantial pretax net losses of $1.48 billion from natural catastrophes, including hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.

#### Key Financial Metrics:

1. **Operating Performance:**
   - **Operating Net Loss:** $1.03 billion this quarter, a decline from an operating income of $122.5 million in the same quarter last year.
   - **Annualized Operating ROE (excluding AOCI and integration costs):** Negative 8% year-to-date, contrasting dramatically with a positive 6.1% in the prior year.

2. **Underwriting Profitability:**
   - **Accident Year ex Cat P&C Combined Ratio:** Improved to 89.8% from 91.3%, indicating a strong performance excluding catastrophic events.

3. **Prior Year Development:**
   - Favorable net development of $30.9 million occurred, chiefly from better-than-expected results in aerospace (Insurance segment) and short tail lines including property catastrophe (Reinsurance segment).

4. **Operating Expenses:**
   - Declined by $99.1 million to $409.4 million, benefiting from reduced losses on variable compensation and favorable FX movements. The company expects full-year operating expenses to be at or below the low end of the guided range of approximately $1.77 billion.

5. **Taxation:**
   - Recognized net income tax benefits of $60.1 million with an operating effective tax rate of 5%, a change from negative 1.6% in the prior year.

6. **Insurance vs. Reinsurance Loss Breakdown:**
   - Catastrophe losses were distributed approximately 48% to Insurance and 52% to Reinsurance.
   - Geographical loss distribution: 51% mainland U.S.; 41% Caribbean; 8% other international events.

7. **Investment Portfolio:**
   - **Net Investment Income:** Slightly increased by $1 million to $172 million.
   - **New Money Rate & Book Yield:** Improved rates due to targeted portfolio rebalancing; financial metrics are under continued pressure due to forward new money rates remaining below the book yield.

8. **Capital Management:**
   - **Share Buyback:** Purchased 2.7 million common shares at $44 per share this quarter; $520 million remaining under the buyback program.
   - **Financial Leverage:** 31.8% at the end of the quarter, with goals to reduce below 30% next year.

9. **Book Values:**
   - **Fully Diluted Book Value per Common Share:** Decreased by $3.88 to $38.27.
   - **Fully Diluted Tangible Book Value per Common Share:** Decreased by $4.01 to $29.70.

#### Forward-Looking Statements:
The management expects the operating tax rate for the full year to be between 4% to 6%, reflective of the third quarter's catastrophe loss impact. Although significant challenges arose from the natural catastrophes, management is focused on efficiency and recovery, not planning additional share repurchases for the remainder of the year.

### Conclusion:
Despite facing severe setbacks from natural disasters, the company showed resilience in its underwriting operations and managed operating expenses effectively. Investment portfolio adjustments contributed to a mild improvement in investment income, while the capital position remains strong with adequate plans for deleveraging. The upcoming quarters will be critical for recovery and strategic realignment post-catastrophe losses.
