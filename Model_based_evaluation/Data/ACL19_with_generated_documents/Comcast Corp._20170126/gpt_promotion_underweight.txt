 based on the specifics we gave on our productivity initiatives. On the second question around wireless and the OCF drag, you're right. We're still in early days with wireless and we're investing in it consistent with what we've described and what we've shared with all of you. And as a result, we do expect that there will be an OCF impact in 2017, but it's in line with what we've communicated in the past, and it's something that we're focused on managing through as we build our wireless business. And as I've said before, when we actually launch the product and start reporting on it, we'll give you more clarity and more information on the specific financial metrics for that business. So stay tuned and thanks for the questions. And, Jason, I'll turn it back to you for the next question. Thank you, Marci and Anthony, for your questions. And thanks, Mike, for your thoughtful responses. Our next question is from Diane. 

Based on the recent earnings call, it's clear that the company is experiencing growth in various sectors, such as Cable Communications and NBCUniversal. However, there are some concerning aspects that investors should be aware of. The decline in free cash flow for the full year is something to be cautious about, as it may indicate challenges in managing working capital and capital expenditures. Additionally, the significant increase in programming expenses, especially in the cable business, may impact the company's operating margin in the near term. The introduction of the wireless business is also expected to have a negative impact on the company's overall operating cash flow in 2017, which should be a concern for investors.

In light of these observations, I would recommend an 'underweight' investment stance for the company at this time. While there are positive growth trends in certain segments, the potential challenges in managing cash flow and the impact of new business ventures should be carefully considered by investors before making significant investment decisions in the company.
