Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is clear that the company has had a very strong second quarter with organic revenue and bookings growth at every segment. The leverage on this organic growth combined with strong execution on margin improvement activities resulted in an overall segment margin of 15%, representing a 320 basis point improvement over the adjusted first quarter. The company's revenue for the second quarter increased by 18%, with strong organic growth of 10% complemented by acquisition growth of 12%.

From a geographic perspective, the US, Europe, and China markets all grew organically year over year. Bookings increased by 19% and backlog increased by 21% to 1.3 billion. Free cash flow was 150 million in the second quarter, with an expectation for strong free cash flow generation in the back half of the year. 

Looking at specific segments, engineered systems revenue grew by 5%, fluids revenue increased by 36%, refrigeration and food equipment revenue increased by 5%, and energy revenue grew by 39% organically. 

The company also revised its full-year revenue and EPS guidance, now expecting total revenue to increase by 12% to 14% with organic revenue growth of 5% to 7%. The full-year forecast for adjusted segment margin is also expected to be up slightly from the prior forecast.

In conclusion, the company's strong second quarter performance and positive outlook for the remainder of the year suggest a favorable outlook for investors. The increase in revenue and EPS guidance, as well as the expected margin expansion in the back half of the year, support an overweight investment stance.
