Based on the conference call transcript, the following key financial metrics were discussed:

- Revenue: Second quarter revenue increased by 18% to 2 billion, with strong organic growth of 10% complemented by acquisition growth of 12%.
- Earnings Per Share (EPS): EPS was reported at $1.04, exceeding the high end of expectations due to strong conversion on higher revenue.
- Segment Margin: Overall segment margin was reported at 15%, representing a 320 basis point improvement over the adjusted first quarter.
- Bookings: Bookings increased by 19% to 2 billion, reflecting organic growth in each segment and a book to bill ratio of 1.01.
- Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow was reported at 150 million in the second quarter, with expectations for very strong free cash flow generation in the back half of the year.
- Return on Investment: Margin expanded year-over-year and sequentially, reflecting improved execution and volume leverage offset by material cost inflation.

The company also revised its full-year revenue and EPS guidance, expecting total revenue to increase by 12% to 14% and full-year EPS to be in the range of $4.23 to $4.33, up $0.15 from the prior forecast at the midpoint. The adjustments in guidance reflect increased second-half performance in all segments.

In terms of working capital, the company experienced an increase of approximately 50 million in net working capital in the quarter, with accounts receivable being about 100 million up. However, they expressed confidence in the collection of receivables going into the back half of the year.

Regarding inventory, the company saw an increase of about 50 million more than expected, driven by better management of peak periods of production flow and selective increases due to material cost inflation in specific areas. The company expressed confidence that this inventory build will burn off in the second half of the year.

Lastly, the company stated that they feel comfortable with their cash flow forecast for the balance of the year and expect to expand margin in the back half on energy, exceeding earlier expectations by around 80 basis points.
