- Sales for the third quarter increased by 6.5% to $16.8 billion, driven by total customer transaction growth of 0.7% and total average ticket growth of 5.8% to $72.63. However, the increase was partially attributed to acquisitions and new stores. 
- Comp sales were 5.7%, driven by an average ticket increase of 4.8% and transaction growth of 0.9%. 
- Gross margin decreased by 28 basis points to 34.07% of sales, impacted by growth in appliances and hurricane-related demand. 
- SG&A decreased to 22.71% of sales, driven by non-cash charges and payroll leverage. 
- Operating income increased to 9.23% of sales, primarily due to the prior year non-cash charges and reduced interest expense. 
- Earnings per share increased by 19.3% to $1.05 for the third quarter, in line with expectations.
- Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were $743 million, while inventory increased by 12.8% to $12.4 billion. 
- Return on invested capital was 19.5%, and the company generated strong operating and free cash flow. 
- The company's capital allocation strategy includes strategic investments and returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. 
- The company reaffirmed its guidance for the year, expecting a total sales increase of approximately 5% and earnings per share between $4.20 to $4.30.
- The company expects cash flows from operations to be approximately $5.4 billion and capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 billion, resulting in estimated free cash flow of approximately $4.2 billion for 2017. 

Overall, the financial performance of the company seems to be positive with increases in sales, earnings per share, and strong cash flow generation. However, the impact of acquisitions, changes in gross margin, increased inventory, and tough prior year comparisons may weigh on future performance. Therefore, maintaining an 'underweight' investment stance for the company may be warranted.
