The company has consistently increased its dividend payments and plans to increase share repurchase activity.

5. Returns on Invested Capital (ROIC): The company has a disciplined process around M&A analysis and integration, aiming to deliver double-digit returns on invested capital. The company's ROIC has consistently improved in the three years since the acquisition of NYSE.
