. That's all well and good, but we need to focus on the key financial metrics like revenue growth, operating expenses, operating margins, earnings per share, and return on invested capital (ROIC). From the transcript, we can see that revenue growth in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by the data and listings segment, with revenues up 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and a 54% recurring revenue in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating expenses were down 3% year-to-year, leading to an increase in adjusted operating margins by 4 points to 57%. Adjusted earnings per share grew 11% to $0.71 on a pro forma basis. These key financial metrics demonstrate a strong performance for the company.

Looking at the full year results, consolidated net revenues were $4.5 billion, up 4% over the prior year or up 6% on a constant currency basis. Trading and clearing revenues grew 2% or 4% on a constant currency basis, while data and listings revenues grew 7%, and adjusted operating margins expanded by four points. The combination of revenue growth and expense discipline drove adjusted earnings growth of 11% versus 2015, resulting in record operating cash flows of $2.1 billion.

The company's commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders is demonstrated by an 18% increase in quarterly dividend and an increase in share repurchase activity. The consistently improving returns on invested capital (ROIC) also indicate the company's disciplined approach to M&A analysis and integration.

Overall, the financial metrics outlined in the earnings call transcript support an 'overweight' investment stance, as the company has demonstrated strong revenue growth, expense discipline, expanding margins, and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders. As a financial analyst, I am confident in recommending an 'overweight' investment stance based on these key financial metrics.
