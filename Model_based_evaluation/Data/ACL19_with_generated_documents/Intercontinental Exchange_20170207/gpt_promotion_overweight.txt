. Overall, I am pleased with the company's performance and outlook. The recent earnings call shows strong revenue growth, particularly in the data and listings segment, and a significant increase in operating margins. The company's capital allocation philosophy, which prioritizes returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, is also a positive indicator of the company's financial health.

Furthermore, the company's disciplined approach to M&A analysis and integration has led to consistently improving returns on invested capital. The management's commitment to increasing dividends and share repurchases, as well as its track record of delivering strong total shareholder returns, are additional reasons to consider an 'overweight' investment stance on this company.

In terms of guidance, the company expects to continue its revenue growth in 2017, with data revenues under contract showing an 8% increase compared to the previous year. The trading and clearing segment also shows potential for growth, with strong commercial participation and open interest levels at record highs.

Overall, the company's strong financial performance, capital allocation strategy, and guidance for continued growth make a compelling case for an 'overweight' investment stance. I recommend considering this company for a promising investment opportunity.
