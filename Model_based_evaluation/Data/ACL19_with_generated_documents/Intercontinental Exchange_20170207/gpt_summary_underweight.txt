. In our view, the recent earnings conference call transcript highlights several key financial metrics that suggest an 'underweight' investment stance. The company reported strong revenue growth of 5% year-over-year and 7% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter of 2016, driven primarily by the data and listings segment. Adjusted operating expenses were down 3% year-over-year, leading to an increase in adjusted operating margins to 57%.

However, the trading and clearing segment only saw a 3% growth in revenues, and the company cited geopolitical and market volatility as potential risks for the coming year. Additionally, the company's capital allocation philosophy of returning 100% of excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, along with plans for significant capital returns in 2017, raises concerns about the company's long-term growth and investment opportunities.

The company's guidance for 2017 includes at least 6% growth in data revenues on a constant currency basis, but the potential impact of acquisitions and divestments on individual data revenue categories is expected to be immaterial. The company also expects expenses to be roughly flat in 2017 versus 2016, despite additional expenses from acquisitions and divestments.

Overall, while the company has delivered strong profit results and generated record operating cash flows, the potential impact of geopolitical and market volatility, as well as the company's capital allocation philosophy and guidance for 2017, suggest a cautious approach to investment in this company.
