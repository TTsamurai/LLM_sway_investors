Based on the information provided in the recent earnings call, here are a few reasons to recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on Nektar:

1. While the company has made substantial progress with Nektar-181 in treating chronic pain and addressing the opioid crisis, there are still uncertainties surrounding the NDA submission and the FDA's review process. The potential approval, review, and scheduling of Nektar-181 are all subject to FDA decisions, and the final outcome remains uncertain.
2. Nektar's focus on immuno-oncology, particularly with Nektar-214, Nektar-262, and Nektar-255, suggests a shift towards a different therapeutic area rather than prioritizing pain treatment. This diversification may impact the company's ability to fully capitalize on the potential of Nektar-181 as a pain medication.
3. The need to find a global partner for Nektar-181 indicates a lack of independent commitment to the pain treatment market and raises questions about the company's long-term goals in this area.
4. While there is strong preliminary efficacy data for Nektar-214, its success in clinical trials and potential future development plans still remain uncertain, which adds an element of risk to the company's focus on immuno-oncology.

In conclusion, the recent earnings call presents a mixed picture for Nektar, with potential opportunities in both pain management and immuno-oncology. However, the uncertainties surrounding the NDA submission for Nektar-181, the company's diversified focus, and the need for global partnerships warrant a cautious or skeptical investment stance, suggesting an 'underweight' position for potential investors.
