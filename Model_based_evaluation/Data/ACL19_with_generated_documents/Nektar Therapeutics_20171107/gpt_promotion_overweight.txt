Based on the recent earnings call from Nektar, it is clear that the company has made substantial progress with its pipeline, particularly with Nektar-181 and Nektar-214 in the field of immune oncology. The company is on track to submit an NDA for Nektar-181 in April 2018, and the FDA has confirmed that the overall safety database is adequate for the submission. Furthermore, the company has engaged in discussions with potential commercial partners for Nektar-181, indicating potential future revenue streams. In the field of immune oncology, Nektar-214 has shown promising preliminary efficacy data in patients and is set to be a keystone therapeutic in the field. Additionally, Nektar is developing a broad portfolio in immune oncology, including Nektar-262 and Nektar-255, with plans to file an IND for the combination trial of Nektar-262 and Nektar-214 by the end of the year.

The recent progress and future potential of Nektar's pipeline products make it an attractive investment opportunity. The company's focus on addressing the opioid crisis with Nektar-181 and its strong position in the immune oncology space, particularly with Nektar-214, make it a compelling investment for the future. Therefore, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Nektar based on its recent earnings call and pipeline advancements.
