Based on the insights and financial metrics derived from the recent earnings conference call, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance in the company. Here are the key points to support this recommendation:

1. Earnings Per Share Growth: The company has shown consistent growth in earnings per share (EPS). In the second quarter of 2017, the EPS increased to $0.85 per share compared to $0.74 per share in the same quarter of 2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, the EPS was $2.04 per share versus $1.97 for the same period in 2016. This indicates strong financial performance and potential for future growth.

2. Customer Growth and Sales Statistics: The company has demonstrated strong customer growth rates, with SCE&G's Electric business adding customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.6% and the regulated gas businesses in South and North Carolina adding customers at rates of 2.9% and 2.6% respectively. Additionally, weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers for the 12 months ended June 30, 2017, were higher by eight tenths of a percent versus the prior period. This indicates a growing customer base and potential for increased sales in the future.

3. Regulatory Rate Base and Returns: The company's regulated rate base of approximately $11.5 billion and the earned return for its electric and gas businesses meet or exceed the stated goals of earning a return of 9% or higher. This demonstrates a solid regulatory framework and potential for consistent returns on investment.

4. Future Growth Strategy: The company has outlined a growth strategy that includes maintaining a reasonable earned return through periodic rate cases, focus on O&M control, and reaping the benefits of lower projected interest expense through debt reduction and share buyback programs. This indicates a proactive approach to driving future growth and maximizing shareholder value.

5. Abandonment of New Nuclear Project: The company's decision to cease construction and pursue abandonment of the new nuclear project indicates a strategic shift towards focusing on the core electric and gas businesses and redeployment of capital. This decision is expected to lead to cost savings and improved financial performance in the future.

In conclusion, the company's strong financial performance, consistent earnings growth, growing customer base, proactive growth strategy, and strategic decisions to focus on core businesses make it an attractive investment opportunity. Therefore, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance in the company.
