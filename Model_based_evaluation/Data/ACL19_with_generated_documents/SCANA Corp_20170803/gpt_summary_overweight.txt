In summary, the earnings conference call transcript highlights several key financial metrics that support an overweight investment stance. Earnings per share for the second quarter of 2017 increased to $0.85 from $0.74 in the same quarter of 2016, and for the six months ended June 30, 2017, earnings per share were $2.04 compared to $1.97 for the same period in 2016. Despite milder weather in 2017, customer growth and rate increases led to increases in electric and gas margins, as well as positive variances in O&M and other income, which partially offset increases in interest expense, depreciation, and property taxes. Moreover, economic trends in the service territory show positive business development, with approximately $480 million in investments expected to create over 7500 jobs in North and South Carolina. Unemployment rates in these states have also decreased, fueling strong customer growth for the company's businesses. Additionally, the company's regulatory rate base and returns remain strong, with a regulated rate base of approximately $11.5 billion and a return on equity meeting or exceeding stated goals. The strong customer growth and electric sales statistics, along with a forecasted CapEx and financing plans, support the company's growth strategy to achieve 4% to 6% earnings growth over three to five years. A 2017 earnings guidance range of $4.15 to $4.35 per share, with an internal target of $4.25 per share, shows a consistent focus on long-term growth, supported by plans to focus on O&M control and lower interest expense through debt management and a share buyback program. Overall, the financial metrics presented in the earnings conference call transcript demonstrate a strong performance and growth potential, supporting an overweight investment stance.
