Our recent earnings call reflects positive trends and growth opportunities for our company. Here are some key takeaways from the call that recommend an 'overweight' investment stance: 

1. Earnings per share for the second quarter of 2017 increased, and the electric margins showed positive growth, despite the impact of less extreme weather.
2. Customer growth and electric sales continue to be strong, with a focus on customer growth rates and positive variances in O&M and gas margins.
3. The company's regulated rate base and returns meet stated goals, with a 9% or higher return on equity for certain business segments.
4. Economic trends in the service territories, particularly in South Carolina, show declining unemployment rates and positive business development.
5. The company's 2017 earnings guidance reiterates a positive outlook and targets annual growth of 4% to 6% over three to five years.

Given these factors, we believe that the company is well-positioned for future growth and profitability. We recommend an 'overweight' investment stance based on the positive earnings call and growth opportunities outlined in the report.
