Based on the recent earnings call, there are several factors that contribute to a skeptical perspective on the company and warrant an 'underweight' investment stance. 

Firstly, the earnings for the second quarter of 2017 and the six months ended June 30, 2017, show a negative impact on earnings due to milder weather, resulting in a decrease in earnings by $0.01 per share quarter-over-quarter and a decrease of $0.20 per share for the first six months of 2017. Additionally, despite positive variances in gas margins and other income, increases in interest expense, depreciation, and property taxes partially offset these gains.

Furthermore, the company's regulatory rate base and returns may be a cause for concern. The 12-month earned return for SCE&G gas fell below the allowed range, resulting in a filing for an annual increase in rates. Similarly, PSNC Energy's temporary high earned return of 10.78% may pose a risk as it's mainly due to timing and is expected to move back towards the allowed return on equity.

Moreover, the wind down activities and the decision to cease construction and pursue abandonment of the new nuclear project raise questions about the company's financial plan and capital deployment. The uncertainty surrounding the tax deductions and the taxable income from the abandonment of the project may create volatility in the company's financials.

In conclusion, the recent earnings call reflects multiple challenges and uncertainties that suggest a cautious approach to investing in the company. Therefore, it is recommended to maintain an 'underweight' investment stance until there is more clarity on the company's financial and operational outlook.
