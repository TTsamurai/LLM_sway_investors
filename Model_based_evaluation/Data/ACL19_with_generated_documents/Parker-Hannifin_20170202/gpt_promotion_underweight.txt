Based on the recent earnings call, it is important to approach the company with caution and skepticism. While the CEO has highlighted positive momentum in various markets, it is crucial to note that the company is still facing challenges, particularly in the oil and gas sector. The CEO mentioned that there are signs of recovery, but it is important to recognize that the offshore drilling contractors are still lagging behind. Additionally, the company reported a decline in key mobile markets in North America, which should be a cause for concern.

Furthermore, the company's outlook for organic growth should be approached with caution. While the CEO expressed optimism, he also emphasized that it's early days and that the company is trying to be as realistic as possible in their guidance. This suggests that the projected growth may not be as sustainable as portrayed.

Lastly, while the CEO mentioned that the company is slightly positive on price and has contracts in place to manage raw material increases, it is important to remain cautious as the pricing environment is not favorable. Additionally, the CEO's comments on customer preparedness for growth primarily towards 2018, indicate that the anticipated growth may not be immediate, and it is important to consider the timeline for potential expansion.

Overall, based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. While there are signs of improvement in certain markets, the overall outlook remains cautious and uncertain. Investors should carefully evaluate the company's performance before making any significant investment decisions.
