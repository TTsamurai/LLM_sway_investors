 for the question. We believe that controlling expenses and inventory will allow us to deliver the mid single-digit EPS increase for the full year, even if top-line growth is more modest than originally planned.

Key Financial Metrics:
1. Comparable Sales: Sales in physical stores and digital channels that have been open for at least a year increased by 0.5% in the first quarter. However, there was a dip in February, followed by a rebound in March and April.
2. Earnings per share: The company reported earnings of $1.36 per share for the first quarter, which was at the low end of their revised outlook.
3. Full-Year Outlook: The company is forecasting low single-digit growth in comparable sales for the second quarter with relatively flat earnings compared to the previous year. They remain optimistic about accelerating momentum in the second half of the year to reach mid-single-digit comparable sales gains.
4. Expense Control Plan: The company has developed a plan to control expenses and inventory in case recent sales trends continue, with the goal of delivering a mid single-digit EPS increase for the full year. This includes investments in physical stores, technology, and the expansion of the digital business.

Overall, while the company faced challenges in the first quarter due to changing customer behavior and soft sales in certain categories, they remain confident in their strategic initiatives and plan to drive improvements in top and bottom-line performance over the rest of the year. They are focused on controlling expenses and inventory while investing in store enhancements, technology, and digital growth to drive long-term profitability.
