Based on the recent earnings call, it is clear that the company is facing challenges in maintaining their previous level of performance. While they remain confident in their strategic initiatives, there are several factors that raise concerns about their future performance.

The company's comparable sales finished Q1 up only 0.5%, with a roller coaster trend throughout the quarter. They also mentioned that they are forecasting low single-digit comparable sales and flat earnings for the second quarter. This indicates a potential slowdown in the business, which is concerning for investors.

The challenges faced in the first quarter, such as soft signature basketball business and a slowdown in traffic, suggest that the company may struggle to achieve their aggressive growth targets for the rest of the year. While they are optimistic about accelerating momentum in the second half of 2017, uncertainties remain about whether they will be able to achieve this.

Furthermore, the company's focus on controlling expenses and inventory as part of a "Plan B" if sales trends continue to be weak, indicates a level of caution about the future performance.

It is also worth noting that the company's reliance on rapidly changing customer preferences, particularly in the digital space, makes it difficult to predict future trends. The company's acknowledgment of rapidly changing consumer habits and the need for a "Plan B" suggests a level of uncertainty about their ability to adapt to these changes.

Overall, based on the cautious and skeptical tone of the recent earnings call, it would be advisable for investors to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance towards the company until there is clearer evidence of improved performance and a more stable outlook.
