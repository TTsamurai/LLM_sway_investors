Based on the information provided in the transcripts of the recent earnings conference call, the company has faced challenges in the first quarter but remains confident in its strong position in the athletic retail industry. The company has been diligently executing strategic initiatives, including driving performance in its core business, expanding its position in Kids, pursuing European expansion opportunities, improving its apparel business, building a more powerful digital business, delivering exceptional growth in women's, and building on its industry-leading team. The company made significant progress on each of these initiatives, and remains positioned at the center of sneaker culture.

Key financial metrics discussed in the transcript include comparable sales, earnings per share, store performance, digital sales growth, inventory management, and expense control. The company reported a mixed performance in the first quarter, with comparable sales up 0.5% and earnings of $1.36 per share, at the low-end of the revised outlook. The company is anticipating a low single-digit increase in comparable sales and relatively flat earnings compared to a year ago for the second quarter. However, the company remains optimistic about accelerating momentum over the second half of 2017 and reaching mid-single-digit comparable sales gains.

The company's strategic initiatives include efforts to elevate customer engagement, invest in technology and store remodels, expand into new markets, improve product assortments, and enhance the digital customer experience. The company also plans to focus on controlling expenses and inventory to deliver mid single-digit earnings per share growth for the full year, even if top-line growth is more modest than originally planned.

Overall, the company remains confident in its ability to drive gradually improving top-line and bottom-line performance over the coming quarters and the year. The company also plans to leverage its strong partnerships with leading vendors such as Nike, Adidas, and Puma to offer compelling product assortments and enhance its overall financial performance.

The company's focus on controlling expenses and maintaining a premium position in the athletic retail industry suggests resilience and a strong foundation for future growth.
