Based on the recent earnings call, the company has shown significant growth in loans and total client funds, with healthy activity across all portfolios. The net interest income and net interest margin have also increased, driven by higher average loan balances and an increase in net loan yield. Despite some margin compression and higher compensation and benefits expense, the company is maintaining a positive outlook for 2017.

The company's tax rate is also expected to be comparable to 2016, with a recognition of a tax benefit due to the implementation of new accounting guidance.

Overall, the company is off to a good start in 2017, with positive fee income trends and a focus on expanding their client base and global footprint while maintaining stable credit quality.

Considering these positive trends and the company's outlook for the year, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The strong loan growth, healthy client funds growth, and overall positive outlook for 2017 indicate that the company is well-positioned for continued success.
