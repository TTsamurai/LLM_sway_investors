Based on the earnings conference call transcript, here are the key insights and financial metrics for the company:

Loan growth: Average loans grew by $809 million or 4.2% to $20.1 billion. Growth was driven primarily by private equity capital call lines and life sciences, with new loan commitments solid and advances strong in the quarter.

Total client funds: Average total client funds grew $1.4 billion or 1.7% to $86.1 billion in the first quarter, reflecting healthy growth due to client funding rounds and exit activity.

Net interest income and margin: Net interest income increased by $13.4 million to $310.3 million in the first quarter, primarily driven by higher average loan balances and an increase in net loan yield due to the impact of the December increase in the Fed funds rate. Net interest margin increased by 15 basis points in the first quarter to 2.88%, but the company expects margin compression to impact net interest income and net interest margin throughout the year.

Credit quality: Stable overall, with an increase in nonaccrual loans primarily due to two new nonaccrual loans in the software space and one previously impaired sponsored buyout loan. Net charge-offs were lower, mainly from early-stage clients.

Noninterest income: Increased to $117.7 million compared to $113.5 million in the fourth quarter, mainly related to higher net gains on investment securities and warrants.

Expenses: Noninterest expense increased by $2.4 million or 1% to $237.6 million, primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense. The company is reiterating its full year core fee income outlook of growth in the high-teens.

Capital ratios: Rose across the board, resulting in a positive trend for the company's capital position.

Effective tax rate: Expectations for the tax rate for 2017 are comparable to 2016, excluding the impact of required accounting changes and other tax items.

Based on these insights and financial metrics, the company's positive outlook and expectations for net interest income and net interest margin have improved as a result of recent interest rate increases. However, competition and a high pace of M&A activity among clients continue to impact loan growth and margin. Additionally, expense growth is expected to be higher due to an improved outlook view on return on equity compared to designated peers. Therefore, an underweight investment stance is recommended for this company due to the potential impact of margin compression, stable but slightly increased nonperforming loans, and higher expense growth.
