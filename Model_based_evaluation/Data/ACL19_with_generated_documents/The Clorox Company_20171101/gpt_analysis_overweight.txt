The company's Q1 performance shows strong growth in all segments, with volume and sales increasing across the board. The Cleaning segment saw a 5% increase in both volume and sales, driven by record shipments of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and strong growth in home care products. The Household segment also demonstrated solid growth, with a 7% increase in volume and 5% increase in sales, driven by the success of premium products such as OdorShield trash bags and Fresh Step cat litter. The Lifestyle segment showed a 2% increase in volume and 4% increase in sales, with double-digit growth in Burt's Bees and strong performance in the food category.

The company's international segment saw a 2% decrease in volume but a 1% increase in sales, reflecting the benefits of pricing and innovation, offset by macroeconomic conditions in Argentina and the impact of hurricanes in Puerto Rico.

Based on the strong Q1 performance and the company's outlook for fiscal year 2018, with continued focus on margin improvement and selective investments in key product categories, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance for this company. The strong growth across all segments, particularly in premium products, and the company's strategic focus on margin improvement and innovation position it for continued success in the future.
