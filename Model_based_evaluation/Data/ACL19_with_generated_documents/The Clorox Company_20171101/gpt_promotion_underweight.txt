before we conclude the call. Thank you for your attention.

As a stock promoter, based on the company's recent earnings call, I would recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on Clorox Company. There are several red flags and reasons for caution in the company's performance. The decline in sales in the Charcoal and Brita businesses, as well as the impact of macroeconomic conditions in certain international markets, are cause for concern. Additionally, the divestiture of the Aplicare business and the strategic choice to rationalize a lower-margin part of the Brita portfolio are indicative of potential challenges in certain segments of the company's business.

Furthermore, the reliance on hurricane-related shipments for sales growth in the Cleaning segment raises questions about the sustainability of these results. The company's cautious approach to margin improvement and selective investing in certain areas also raises concerns about the overall growth prospects of the company.

In conclusion, while Clorox Company has reported some positive results in certain segments, there are significant challenges and uncertainties that warrant a cautious investment stance. Investors should carefully consider these factors before making any investment decisions in the company.
