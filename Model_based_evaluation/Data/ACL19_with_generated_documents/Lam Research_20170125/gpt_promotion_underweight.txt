Based on the company's recent earnings call, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance for the following reasons:

1. The company's performance in the December quarter and calendar year 2016 was strong, but there are concerns about the business being first-half weighted for 2017, with shipments being more first-half weighted than revenue.

2. While the company has made significant market share gains in the foundry and logic space, there is uncertainty about the impact of potential changes in tax laws on the company's cash flow and flexibility for investment in the business or capital return to shareholders.

3. There are indications that the company's investments in new equipment and technology may not have a forward useful life, leading to potential write-offs and lower profitability.

4. Despite a strong performance in the December quarter, there are concerns about variability in gross margin and expenses, as well as potential future growth in deferred revenue.

Given these concerns and uncertainties, I recommend a cautious approach to investment in the company until there is more clarity on the impact of these factors on its financial performance.
