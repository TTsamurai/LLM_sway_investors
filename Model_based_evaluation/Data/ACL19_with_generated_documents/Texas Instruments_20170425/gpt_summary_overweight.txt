 for R&D. Our investments in R&D have been focused on industrial and automotive, and those investments are paying off with over half of our revenue now coming from those sectors. Additionally, our focus on 300-millimeter manufacturing has resulted in increased efficiency and lower costs, leading to higher gross margins and free cash flow. Our strategy for adding capacity ahead of demand has allowed us to make efficient and cost-effective long-term investments. In terms of operating expenses, we have been running at the lower end of our model, with stable OpEx between 20% to 25% of revenue for the past 27 months.

In summary, the company's strong financial performance, increase in gross profit and operating profit, and focus on strategic investments in R&D and capacity expansion position it well for long-term growth. Considering the company's growth prospects and strong financial metrics, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance.
