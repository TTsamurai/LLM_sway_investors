. Thank you for your thorough and detailed earnings call. Based on the information provided, I am recommending an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company's strong performance in the third quarter, with growth in net sales and EPS, despite a volatile environment, demonstrates its resilience and ability to deliver results. The company's strategic initiatives in the CMG and snack segments align with the positive growth trends in the $100 billion U.S. snack market. The company continues to drive innovation with products like Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch and Reese's Popped Snack Mix, which have shown encouraging results. Additionally, the company's focus on e-commerce and its collaboration with strategic partners show a commitment to adapting to changing consumer behavior and retail trends.

Furthermore, the company's measured investments in international markets, particularly in Mexico, Brazil, and India, have resulted in solid marketplace gains and improved operating income trends. The company's focus on profitable growth and margin expansion indicates a long-term strategic approach to value creation.

While the company has faced challenges such as higher freight and distribution costs, it has demonstrated a proactive approach to addressing these issues and maintaining a strong marketplace presence. The company's commitment to strategic revenue management and effective promotional programs reflects a disciplined approach to driving top-line growth and maximizing profitability.

Overall, the company's performance and strategic initiatives position it for sustained top and bottom-line growth over the long-term, making it an attractive investment opportunity. I believe that the company's strong financial position and focus on value creation for shareholders support an 'overweight' investment stance. Thank you.
