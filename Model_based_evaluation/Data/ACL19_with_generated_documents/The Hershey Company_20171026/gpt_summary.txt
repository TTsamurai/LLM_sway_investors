. We continue to see strong growth in our core chocolate brands, such as Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat, and Kisses, which are driving market share gains. Our strategic initiatives, such as the transition to stand-up pouches for our core chocolate products and the expansion of our snacks platform, have shown positive results and are expected to drive long-term growth. Additionally, our focus on e-commerce has resulted in a 40% increase in U.S. sales in that channel. Our international segment is also performing well, with solid gains in key markets like Mexico, Brazil, and India. We are committed to maintaining our competitive edge in the marketplace through marketing, innovation, and strategic investments. Looking ahead to 2018, we are confident in our preliminary plans, which include the launch of innovative products such as Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch Triple Chocolate and Hershey's Gold. We remain focused on increasing margins through top-line growth and cost control. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow position us well for future success, and we will continue to build value for all Hershey shareholders through our strategic initiatives. Thank you for your support.
