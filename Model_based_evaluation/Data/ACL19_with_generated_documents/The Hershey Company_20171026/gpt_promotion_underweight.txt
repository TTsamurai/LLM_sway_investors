. A cautious or skeptical stance on Hershey Company can be recommended based on the segment's risk, costs, and challenges highlighted in the recent earnings call. While net sales and EPS increased in the third quarter, the company is facing challenges such as higher freight and distribution costs, increased advertising expenses, and pressure on operating profit. Supply chain costs, as well as new regulatory changes, are expected to continue to impact the company's performance in the near future.

Furthermore, the company is facing pressure in the marketplace due to weather-related issues, seasonality, and portfolio right-sizing. Additionally, growth in certain areas of the business, such as snacking, is exerting pressure on margins due to lower margins on new products. The company is also expected to face challenges in maintaining distribution points due to SKU rationalization and new packaging initiatives.

Overall, the company's focus on strategic revenue management and maximizing promotional programs may not fully offset the challenges and pressures they are currently facing. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance on the company is recommended, considering the risks and challenges highlighted in the recent earnings call. Investors should approach their investment in Hershey Company with caution and skepticism based on the company's current financial and operational outlook.
