Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, the company has shown strong performance in the second quarter, with total revenue of $326 million. The revenue was primarily driven by the strong performance of Jakafi, which recorded net product revenue of $276 million, representing a 33% increase over the same period last year. The company has also increased its full-year Jakafi net product revenue guidance to a range of $1.090 billion to $1.120 billion.

The gross-to-net adjustment for the second quarter was approximately 12%, and the company expects the total gross-to-net adjustment for the full year to be approximately 13%. The cost of product revenue for the quarter was $20 million, including the cost of goods sold for Jakafi and Iclusig, as well as royalties and amortization of acquired product rights.

The company's R&D expense for the quarter was $202 million, including $23 million in non-cash stock compensation. The full-year R&D expense is expected to be in the range of $1.050 billion to $1.150 billion, reflecting an increase from the previous guidance. This increase is related to the acceleration of the Phase 3 plans for epacadostat.

The SG&A expense for the quarter was $90 million, including $11 million in non-cash stock compensation. The company also recorded a $7 million expense related to the change in the fair market value of the contingent consideration for the Iclusig royalty liability.

Additionally, the company recorded non-operating expenses, including a $20 million unrealized loss on long-term investments and a one-time debt exchange expense of $1 million related to senior note conversions.

The company ended the second quarter with $609 million in cash and marketable securities and expects to end the year with over $600 million. The full-year net loss is now expected to be between $180 million to $200 million, taking into account the previously mentioned changes.

In conclusion, the company's second quarter performance reflects the strength of its underlying business and the continued advancement of its clinical development programs. The company continues to execute on its development plans for a robust pipeline and looks forward to updating stakeholders on its progress during its third quarter call.

Considering the company's strong performance and positive outlook, as a financial analyst, I recommend adopting an 'overweight' investment stance for this company. The growth in revenue and the robust pipeline indicate the potential for strong future performance, making it an attractive investment opportunity.
