Based on the financial metrics reported, the overall financial performance of the company has been mixed. While core sales growth and operating margin improved, gross margin, interest expense, and tax rate have seen declines. The significant increase in diluted shares outstanding also warrants caution. Additionally, the reported and normalized gross margins have declined, indicating potential challenges in cost management. The high debt level is also a concern.

Given the mixed financial performance and the high debt level, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. Further analysis of the company's financial health and business strategies is necessary before considering an investment opportunity.
