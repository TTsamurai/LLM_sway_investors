Based on the company's recent earnings call, there are some concerning factors that have been highlighted in their performance. The company reported declines in both reported and normalized gross margins, with reported gross margin at 36.8% compared with 38.3% last year and normalized gross margin at 37.2% compared with 38.5% last year. This decline was attributed to negative mix effects related to the Jarden transaction, deconsolidation of Venezuela, and the unfavorable effect of foreign currency.

Additionally, the company reported a tax rate of 57.7% compared with the previous year's reported rate of 14.1%, along with a normalized tax rate of 29.8% compared with 23.2% in the previous year. The increase in the normalized tax rate was driven by the unfavorable mix impact of the Jarden acquisition and the absence of certain discrete tax benefits compared with the prior year.

Furthermore, the company mentioned ongoing macro-driven slowdown in Brazil, planned complexity reduction initiatives, and transitions in the business model in Canada, which have impacted net sales in Tools, Writing, and Baby segments.

The company also mentioned the impact of increased advertising and promotion investment, as well as higher interest expense, share count, and reported tax rate. Although the company anticipates a tax benefit in 2017, it is important to note that this is a one-time benefit and may not have a lasting impact on the company's financials.

Overall, based on the cautious perspective presented in the earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company until there is more clarity on the impact of these factors on the company's financial performance and the effectiveness of the company's deleveraging plans.
