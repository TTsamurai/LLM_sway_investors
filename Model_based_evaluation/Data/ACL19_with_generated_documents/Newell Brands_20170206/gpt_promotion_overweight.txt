Based on the recent earnings call, the company has shown significant progress in transforming the organization, achieving 3.7% core sales growth, delivering over $210 million in synergies and Project Renewal savings, and progressing in deleveraging the balance sheet. Additionally, the company refined its portfolio with strategic divestitures and acquisitions.

The fourth quarter results were solid, with reported net sales of $4.14 billion, a 165% increase compared to last year, driven largely by the Jarden transaction. Core sales also increased by 2.5%, driven by strong results from various business segments.

Operating results showed strong growth despite certain challenges, with improved operating income on the legacy business, profit contribution from acquisitions, and savings and synergies from Project Renewal offsetting negative factors such as increased advertising and promotion investment, negative foreign currency, increased amortization of intangibles, and higher interest expense, tax rate, and share count.

The company reported a significant increase in normalized EPS, reaching $0.80, a nearly 43% increase versus last year. Operating cash flow also saw a significant increase, reaching $991.5 million during the quarter and $1.8 billion for the full year, showing improved working capital results.

Furthermore, the company has been making significant progress in deleveraging the balance sheet, repaying over $2 billion in debt since the Jarden transaction closed, with plans to use the proceeds from the Tools divestiture to further deleverage.

The company also demonstrated a proactive approach to tax planning, anticipating a tax rate of about 23% in 2017, reflecting anticipated discrete tax benefits.

Overall, the recent earnings call highlights the company's strong performance, progress in strategic initiatives, and proactive approach to financial management. Based on this information, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on the company, as it has shown significant growth potential and proactive financial management strategies.
