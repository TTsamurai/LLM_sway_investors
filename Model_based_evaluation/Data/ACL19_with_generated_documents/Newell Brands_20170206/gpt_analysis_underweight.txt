Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, there are several key insights and financial metrics that support an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. Here are the main reasons:

1. Decline in Margin: The reported and normalized gross margins declined due to negative mix effect related to the Jarden transaction, deconsolidation of Venezuela, and the unfavorable effect of foreign currency. This indicates challenges in maintaining profitability, which is a concern for investors.

2. Increased Interest Expenses: The interest expense rose significantly reflecting higher borrowings used to finance the Jarden and Elmer's acquisitions. The projected interest expense for 2017 is also high. This indicates increased financial leverage and raises concerns about the company's ability to service its debt.

3. High Tax Rates: The reported tax rate was significantly higher compared to the previous year due to a one-time deferred tax charge and absence of certain discrete tax benefits. The normalized tax rate also increased, driven by the unfavorable mix impact of the Jarden acquisition. This indicates potential ongoing tax challenges for the company.

4. Dilution from Share Issuance: The year-over-year increase in diluted shares outstanding reflects shares issued for the Jarden acquisition. This dilution may impact future earnings per share and shareholder returns.

5. Decline in Core Sales: Some segments, such as Home Solutions and Commercial Products, experienced declines in net and core sales, indicating potential challenges in these business areas.

6. Currency and Market Risks: Significant currency fluctuations, particularly in the peso and Canadian dollar, pose risks to the company's international operations and financial performance.

Based on these insights and financial metrics, it is advisable to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. The challenges in maintaining margins, increased interest expenses, high tax rates, dilution from share issuance, and declining core sales indicate potential risks for investors. It would be prudent to carefully assess the company's financial performance and future outlook before considering an investment in the company.
