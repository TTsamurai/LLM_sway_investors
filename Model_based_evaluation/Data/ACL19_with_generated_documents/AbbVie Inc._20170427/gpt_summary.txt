 

Thank you for providing the transcripts. Based on the information provided, it is clear that AbbVie is making significant progress in their pipeline updates and development programs for various therapeutic areas. I will focus on key financial metrics from the transcripts to provide a summary report.

Firstly, in the hem-onc programs, it is important to note the submission of a supplemental new drug application for the use of Imbruvica in patients with chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) who failed prior systemic therapy. If approved, Imbruvica would be the first and only therapy specifically indicated for chronic GVHD. There is an expectation of a regulatory decision in the second half of the year. This milestone could potentially impact AbbVie's financials by expanding the approved uses of Imbruvica and driving future growth.

Additionally, data readouts for Imbruvica and Venclexta, such as from an interim analysis in front-line mantle cell lymphoma and other forms of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, are anticipated later this year. If positive, these data readouts could impact the financial outlook for the respective programs.

In the solid tumor programs, the TRINITY study evaluating Rova-T in third-line-plus small cell lung cancer is expected to progress, and data is anticipated later this year, with a commercial launch planned for 2018. Positive data from this study could potentially impact AbbVie's financial performance in the oncology space.

For the HCV program, the potential regulatory approval for the pan-genotypic next-generation HCV therapy in the US, EU, and Japan later this year might have financial implications for AbbVie's revenue and market share in the HCV market.

In the immunology programs, the Phase 3 program for risankizumab in psoriasis and Crohn's disease, as well as the development programs for ABT-494 in RA and inflammatory bowel diseases, have the potential to significantly impact AbbVie's financials in the immunology market.

Overall, the anticipated milestones, data readouts, and potential regulatory approvals across AbbVie's pipeline updates could have significant financial implications for the company, impacting revenue, market share, and growth opportunities. It will be important to closely monitor these developments and their impact on AbbVie's financial metrics.
