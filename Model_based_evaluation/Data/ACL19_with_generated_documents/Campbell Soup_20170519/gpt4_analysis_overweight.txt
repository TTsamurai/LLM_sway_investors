Our analysis accentuates CSC's resilience and adaptability in a volatile market, highlighting its potential for long-term value creation.

**Market Context:**
CSC operates in a challenging environment with pressures from an aggressive retail landscape, changing consumer preferences towards healthier options, and intense competition.

However, there have been improvements in consumer spending towards the end of the quarter which CSC has managed to capture to a certain extent.

**Financial Performance Overview:**
1. **Organic Sales:** Year-to-date, organic sales declined by 1%.

2. **Promotional and Marketing Strategies:** CSC strategically utilizes promotional activities to support higher-margin, trending products which boost both market presence and revenue.

**Risks and Concerns:**
1. **Consumer Preference Shifts:** Continuous pivoting is required to address the fast-evolving preferences for healthier options and fresh food segments.
2. **Retail and Competitive Pressure:** Ongoing aggression in retail and e-commerce may put additional pressure on pricing, margins, and traditional sales channels.
