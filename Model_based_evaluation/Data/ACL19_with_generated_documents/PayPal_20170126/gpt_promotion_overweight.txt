1. Strong Financial Results: PayPal ended 2016 with solid financial results, reaching $2.981 billion in revenues, which is a 19% increase on an FX neutral basis.

2. Platform and Merchant Partnerships: The company has established transformative strategic partnerships with networks, financial institutions, tax companies, and mobile carriers, which have significantly increased the market opportunity for the company.

3. Growth in Active Customer Accounts: PayPal added 18 million new active accounts in the past year, with increased customer engagement and strong performance across its global platform.

4. Mobile Payment Volume: The company has seen a 55% increase in mobile payment volume, highlighting the importance and growth of mobile payments as a competitive differentiator.

5. Innovative Products and Services: PayPal offers a suite of products and services to merchants on an integrated platform, including One Touch, which has redefined online checkout and has exceeded adoption projections.

6. Expanding Mission and Value Proposition: PayPal's separation from eBay has allowed it to widen the distance from its competitors, upgrade its platform, and invest significantly in global compliance capabilities.

7. Strategic Partnerships and Alliances: The company has formed partnerships with financial institutions, leading retailers, cellular carriers, software providers, and other market leaders across various industries, which are expected to drive growth.

8. Monetization Opportunities: PayPal plans to broaden the rollout of Venmo and plans for monetization of customer choice, which are expected to have a significant impact in 2018 and beyond.

In summary, based on the company's strong financial results, strategic partnerships, and growth opportunities, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on PayPal. The company's position in the rapidly growing mobile and digital payments market, along with its innovative products and services, make it a compelling investment opportunity for the future.
