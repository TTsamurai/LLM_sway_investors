. Thank you for that transcript of the earnings call. Based on the information provided, it seems that the company is performing well and has achieved strong growth in the first quarter of 2017. The revenue, EPS, and cash flow have all shown positive results, and the company has highlighted several areas of growth and progress, including expanding relationships with hospital health systems and new acquisitions.

However, despite the positive results, there are some cautionary points to consider. The ongoing concerns about the PAMA regulations and the impact on Medicare payments for lab tests could present challenges for the company in the future. Additionally, the company's reliance on partnerships and acquisitions for growth may indicate some level of dependency on external factors for continued success.

Based on the cautious perspective, it would be recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. While the company has shown strong performance in the first quarter, the potential challenges and uncertainties in the regulatory environment and market dependencies should be taken into consideration when evaluating investment opportunities.
