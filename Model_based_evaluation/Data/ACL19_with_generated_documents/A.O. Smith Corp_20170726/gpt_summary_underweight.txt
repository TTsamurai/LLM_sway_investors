the price increase from last year, but it's really going to depend on where steel goes, and right now, that's hard to predict. So, we're hopeful by the end of the year, we may get some relief. But right now, it's just hard to predict. And we haven't seen any improvement. So, that's all impacting our future results. Given the increase in steel costs and the impact on margins, coupled with higher working capital outlays and lower cash flow from operations, it is clear that the company is facing significant financial headwinds. With the ongoing uncertainty surrounding steel prices and the potential for further margin compression, it is advisable to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on this company. The company's reliance on the North America segment for sales growth and the margin decline in the Rest of World segment also raise concerns about the company's ability to sustain its growth momentum and profitability in the future. With a decreased cash flow from operations and higher working capital outlays, the company's financial performance may continue to be under pressure in the coming quarters. Furthermore, the anticipated increase in capital spending for the new manufacturing facility in China will further strain the company's financial resources. As such, it is prudent to take a cautious approach and recommend an 'underweight' investment stance for this company.
