 the cost increases with pricing actions in the future. Additionally, with the strong performance of our commercial water heaters and boilers in North America, as well as the growth in sales in China and the rest of the world segment, we are confident in our growth strategy for the company. Our cash flow from operations may be lower in 2017 compared to 2016, but it is still strong at approximately $375 million. Our capital spending plans for 2017 include investments in a new manufacturing facility in Nanjing, China, which will support the growth of our water treatment and air purification products in the region. We expect our effective income tax rate to be approximately 28.5% in 2017, lower than the 29.4% rate in 2016. Overall, we have increased the midpoint of our 2017 EPS guidance by $0.03 per share, representing a 13% increase in EPS compared with our 2016 results. Based on these positive financial results and our strong growth strategy, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. Thank you.
