**Investment Stance: Overweight**
Given the consistent growth in revenues, operational efficiencies, and strategic expansions, coupled with a strong liquidity position and prudent capital management strategies, maintaining an 'overweight' investment recommendation is advised. The expected continued rise in sales, particularly in high-demand sectors and regions, and the beneficial impact of corporate tax rate reductions reinforce this stance. However, monitoring steel price fluctuations remains crucial as this could influence future profit margins and operational costs.
