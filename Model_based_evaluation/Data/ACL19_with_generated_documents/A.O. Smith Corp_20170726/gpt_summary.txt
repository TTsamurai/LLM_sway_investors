some of the increased steel costs through pricing actions and continued strong performance in commercial water heaters and boilers. We anticipate the growth in our China segment to continue, driven by higher demand for our consumer products in the region, particularly water treatment and air purification products. Overall, we remain optimistic about our growth strategy and our ability to navigate the challenges posed by increased steel costs. Our focus on brand building and expansion in Tier 2 and 3 cities in China, as well as the construction of our new manufacturing facility in Nanjing, will support our continued growth in the region. Despite the higher steel costs, we have adjusted our guidance for 2017, with a 13% increase in EPS compared to 2016, and we remain committed to delivering strong financial results. Thank you.
