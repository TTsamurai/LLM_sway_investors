 the increase in steel costs through pricing actions and continued strong sales performance in both North America and Rest of World segments. Considering the increase in sales, higher net earnings, and increased earnings per share compared to the previous year, it is clear that the company is performing well financially. Additionally, the company's strong liquidity position, balance sheet strength, and low debt-to-capital ratio are all positive indicators of financial health. The company's effective income tax rate is also expected to be lower in 2017 compared to the previous year, which will further benefit the earnings per share.

While the higher steel costs have impacted segment margins, the company's strategies to offset these costs through pricing actions and strong sales performance demonstrate management's proactive approach to financial challenges. The company's capital spending plans, including the construction of a new manufacturing facility in China, indicate a clear focus on long-term growth and expansion in key markets. Furthermore, the company's stock repurchase activities and projected average diluted outstanding shares in 2017 show a commitment to enhancing shareholder value.

In conclusion, the company's financial performance and strategic initiatives support a positive investment stance, with an overweight recommendation based on the outlined financial metrics and performance indicators.
