Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, we recommend adopting an 'underweight' investment stance. Several key financial metrics in the second quarter show concerning trends. Although average loans increased 0.9% on a linked quarter basis and grew 3.4% from a year ago, commercial loan growth rebounded from the first quarter, reflecting a slow start in the year. Line utilization has not increased materially, reflecting potential weaknesses in customer borrowing activity. Additionally, the competitive environment in commercial mortgage markets has created unfavorable conditions from a risk and return standpoint, indicating potential challenges in the real estate lending segment. 

Regarding revenue, although there was a 3.1% increase in the second quarter, this was attributed to notable items such as the Visa Europe gain in non-interest income and non-interest expense related to interest accruals and a charitable contribution a year ago. Excluding these items, net income only increased slightly year-over-year, suggesting limited organic growth. Non-interest expense also increased, primarily due to higher compensation expense and marketing and business development expense.

Furthermore, the tax equivalent tax rate is expected to approximate 29% in the third quarter, potentially adding to the company's overall tax burden. Additionally, there are concerns about managing costs related to risk and compliance programs, as well as the impact of the FDIC insurance surcharge.

The company's capital position, indicated by the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, is at 9.3% compared to the capital target of 8.5%, suggesting potential inefficiencies in capital management. 

Finally, merchant acquiring revenue is expected to be essentially flat in the third quarter, and growth will begin to normalize in the fourth quarter and into 2018. This indicates potential challenges in revenue growth in the near future.

Based on these financial metrics, we recommend adopting an 'underweight' investment stance on the company.
