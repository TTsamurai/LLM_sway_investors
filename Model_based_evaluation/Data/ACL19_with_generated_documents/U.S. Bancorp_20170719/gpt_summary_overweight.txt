Forward-looking guidance for the third quarter included an expected total loan growth in the 1% to 1.5% range, positive operating leverage in each of the next two quarters, and a taxable equivalent tax rate approximating 29% in the third quarter.

Furthermore, the company demonstrated a prudent approach to managing risk and maintaining stable credit metrics, with particular strengths in retail leasing, commercial real estate lending, and middle market lending. The management's guidance and operational strategies outline a comprehensive and sustainable growth plan that aligns with an 'overweight' investment stance.
