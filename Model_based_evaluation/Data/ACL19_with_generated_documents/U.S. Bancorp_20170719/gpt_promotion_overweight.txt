Based on the recent earnings call, the company has shown positive growth trends in commercial and middle market lending, stable credit metrics, and a record revenue of $5.5 billion, which is 3.1% higher compared with the first quarter and 4.2% higher compared with the same quarter a year ago. Additionally, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $3 billion in the second quarter, up 2.4% compared with the first quarter and 5.9% higher than the second quarter of 2016. The company also expects linked quarter total loan growth to be in the 1% to 1.5% range and for the net interest margin to increase in a manner similar to the first quarter. Additionally, they expect to deliver positive operating leverage in each of the next two quarters supported by year-over-year expense growth of 3% to 5%, with a capital position that exceeds their target.

Based on these positive trends and the company's guidance for growth in the next few quarters, I would recommend taking an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. Their focus on sustainable growth and prudent risk management make them a compelling investment opportunity. Their strong performance in commercial and middle market lending, stable credit metrics, and record revenue indicate a positive outlook for the company's future. Additionally, their management team has expressed confidence in the company's ability to achieve positive operating leverage and sustainable growth in the coming quarters. Therefore, I believe that investors should consider overweighting their investment in this company.
