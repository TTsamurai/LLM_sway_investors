2. Gross Margin and Operating Income: The company's gross margin was at the high end of guidance at 69.5%, and operating income increased 6% sequentially to $173 million. These figures indicate strong financial performance and profitability.

3. Cash Flow and Capital Allocation: The company generated a record $934 million in operating cash flow for the year, and returned $855 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The board authorized an increase in dividends for the 12th consecutive year, demonstrating a commitment to returning value to shareholders.
