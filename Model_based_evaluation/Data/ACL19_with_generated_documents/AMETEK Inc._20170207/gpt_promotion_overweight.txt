 based on their strong position in the healthcare niche market. The recent acquisition of Rauland-Borg has provided tremendous opportunity to expand AMETEK's medical technology exposure into a strong growth segment. With the overall medical market exposure for AMETEK at roughly 13% of sales, the addition of Rauland-Borg further solidifies their presence in the healthcare industry.

Furthermore, AMETEK's focus on new product development, including investments in research, development and engineering, are driving strong product and technology differentiation across the business. With a vitality index of 24% in 2016, AMETEK's continued investment in RD&E efforts is a key element in their organic growth initiatives.

In addition to strategic acquisitions and new product development, AMETEK's focus on operational excellence, including lean manufacturing, global sourcing, value analysis, and value engineering, supports improved long-term organic growth and drives continued operating improvements across all areas of the business.

Looking ahead to 2017, market conditions have improved from the previous year, with stabilization in challenging markets and continuing organic orders growth. Overall, AMETEK expects sales to be up mid-single digits, organic sales to be up low-single digits, and earnings to be in the range of $2.34 to $2.46 per diluted share, up 2% to 7% over 2016.

The recent acquisition of Rauland-Borg is expected to have a positive impact on the company's sales and earnings growth, with a strong management team and substantial opportunities for international expansion. With the healthcare space continuing its shift to value-based care and patient outcome improvement initiatives, Rauland-Borg's value proposition to customers positions it well for continued growth in the medical market.

In summary, based on the company's recent earnings call and the acquisition of Rauland-Borg, AMETEK is well-positioned for strong growth in 2017 and beyond. With a diverse range of growth strategies, including strategic acquisitions, new product development, global market expansion, and operational excellence, AMETEK presents a compelling investment opportunity and a recommendation for an 'overweight' investment stance.
