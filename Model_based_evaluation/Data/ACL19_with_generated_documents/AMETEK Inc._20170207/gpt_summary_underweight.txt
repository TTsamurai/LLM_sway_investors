 in international markets. The healthcare space is transitioning to value-based care and patient outcome improvement initiatives, which are key elements of Rauland-Borg's value proposition to their customers. We see attractive incremental growth opportunities by increasing its market share in international markets, expanding through additional acquisition opportunities, and leveraging our operational excellence capabilities. Rauland provides us the opportunity to expand our medical technology exposure into a strong growth segment while expanding our broad exposure to the medical market.

With the acquisition of Rauland, the overall medical market exposure for AMETEK is roughly 13% of sales. Over the last 12 months, we have deployed approximately $730 million in capital on six acquisitions and we acquired approximately $300 million in sales. We remain bullish on our acquisition pipeline and are excited to continue adding shareholder value through our proven acquisition capabilities.

However, as a financial analyst adopting an 'underweight' investment stance, it is important to acknowledge that the recent acquisitions and expected sales growth may not be enough to overcome the overall declining sales and margins for the company as a whole. The organic sales were down across all segments, and despite optimistic projections for 2017, there are no guarantees that these projections will be met. This uncertainty, coupled with the lack of substantial improvement in overall financial metrics, suggests a cautious approach to investing in AMETEK at this time. It is important to closely monitor the company's ability to achieve the projected sales and earnings growth, and to evaluate the impact of the Rauland acquisition on the overall financial performance of AMETEK.
