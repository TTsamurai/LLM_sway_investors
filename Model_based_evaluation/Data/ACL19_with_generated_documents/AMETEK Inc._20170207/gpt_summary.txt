 for expansion in international markets alongside additional acquisition opportunities. We are looking at potential ways to increase the market share and lever our operational excellence capabilities to drive growth. Rauland's presence in the healthcare and education markets makes them a strong leader with an attractive product mix. They are a valuable addition to our portfolio. We expect to see excellent returns from this acquisition.

In terms of organic growth, we are cautiously optimistic as market conditions have improved from last year. We anticipate our sales and earnings to grow in 2017. Our recent acquisition of Rauland, along with our strong balance sheet and significant cash flow generation, positions us well to drive strong growth. We have a talented and experienced management team and we are excited about the future of AMETEK.

Overall, we believe that our four growth strategies - strategic acquisitions, new product development, global market expansion, and operational excellence - will continue to drive the success of our business. We have made substantial investments in research, development, and engineering to support product and technology differentiation across our business, which has resulted in a 24% vitality index in 2016. Our operational excellence activities, including lean manufacturing, global sourcing, and strategic procurement, have yielded significant operating improvements and we continue to expand these activities to drive long-term organic growth.

In terms of growth outlook, we anticipate overall sales to be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis from 2016, with organic sales expected to be up low-single digits. We expect earnings for 2017 to be in the range of $2.34 to $2.46 per diluted share, up 2% to 7% over 2016. For the first quarter of 2017, we are expecting overall sales to be roughly flat, with organic sales down low-single digits. We believe that the improving trend in organic orders and the stabilization of market conditions will contribute to positive growth for the rest of the year.

In summary, we are driven by our success in the fourth quarter and are optimistic about the opportunities for growth in 2017. We remain committed to our growth strategies and believe that we are well-positioned to deliver strong performance in the coming year. Thank you.
