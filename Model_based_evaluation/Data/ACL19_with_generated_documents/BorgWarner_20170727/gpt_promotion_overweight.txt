Based on the recent earnings call, the company has shown strong performance in the second quarter of the year. With sales increasing by 2.6% on a reported basis and 7.8% on a comparable basis, the company has exceeded the high-end of their guidance. This is particularly impressive given that the weighted average light vehicle industry production was down more than 1%. In addition, the company saw a 25% growth in China, despite a production market that was down about 1%.

The company's operating profit was also strong, with a 20 basis point improvement from the previous year. Organic operating income was up $18 million on $176 million of higher sales, resulting in an incremental margin of 10% in the quarter. Drivetrain segment net sales were $921 million, with adjusted EBIT of $110 million or 11.9% of sales. The Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $16 million on $133 million of higher sales, resulting in an incremental margin of 14%.

In terms of cash flow, the company generated $399 million of net cash from operating activities in the first half of the year, up $37 million from the first half of 2016. Free cash flow was $145 million, up $17 million from 2016. The company's balance sheet debt was flat, with a decrease in cash primarily due to return of capital activities.

Looking forward, the company expects 6.5% to 7.5% organic growth for the year, which is very strong given the industry backdrop and stronger than their expectations going into the year. They also expect their consolidated operating income margin to expand by 30 basis points to 40 basis points for the full year.

Based on these strong financial results and the company's positive outlook, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. Their performance in the second quarter demonstrates their ability to navigate challenging market conditions and continue to grow their business. Their focus on new product development and participation in the impending electrification trend bodes well for future growth. Overall, the company's strong performance and positive outlook make it an attractive investment opportunity.
