, and especially that it can have a significant impact on lung function and reduction in exacerbations. This would be a key differentiating factor for us. Additionally, we have a strong pipeline with several promising late-stage programs, such as REGN2810 in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, EYLEA in wet age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema, and Praluent in cardiovascular disease. However, despite this strong pipeline and promising late-stage programs, I am adopting an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. This is due to the competitive landscape and the potential impact of healthcare system mechanics, reimbursement, and rebates on market share growth. It's important to recognize that while the company's track record and institutional memory have been valuable in bringing forward successful product candidates, the healthcare industry is still very challenging and the bar for success is rightfully set very high. Therefore, it's important for investors to carefully evaluate the potential risks and rewards associated with investing in the company given the current competitive landscape and market dynamics.
