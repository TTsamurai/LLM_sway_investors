 to the extent that it does. And then on top of that, if it can show that same degree of benefit in the high Eo population and the low Eo population, I think that's where we'll really be differentiating ourselves. It's really hard to say without having the data in front of us, but based on our Phase 2 data and the pivotal nature of the Phase 2 data, and based on our previously reported positive Phase 2b study in a very similar population, I think we're very optimistic and confident about the potential positive outcome of the LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study. And you know, this has been such a long journey and to get dupilumab to the doorstep of a potential first approval in asthma, it's really just a tremendous feeling and we're very excited to see what the data will show. And just to reiterate, this has been a really productive year for our clinical programs and we look forward to continued progress and exciting data readouts in the second half of this year. Thank you.
