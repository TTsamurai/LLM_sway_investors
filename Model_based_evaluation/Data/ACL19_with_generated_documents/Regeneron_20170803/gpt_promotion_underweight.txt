, including both high and low Eos populations, and really have a meaningful impact on lung function and exacerbations. So that's where the real excitement is, and that's what we're really hopeful for. And as far as number of patients and other kinds of things like that, it's a really big study, 1,800 patients. And it's a pretty straightforward design, and we're obviously doing our best to make it as broad as we can. And, as I mentioned in my comments, the stakes are very high here for us. As I said, REGN2810 is turning out to be perhaps more important than we imagined, our IL-4/IL-13 receptor blockade. And our PD-1 antibody, as you pointed out, just saw another competitor fail in a very, very high profile manner. This is a very, very cutting-edge area that we're in the midst of right now, and we hope to play a big role in this field, and have our medicines be part of the foundation of these new standards of care that are being set. This is a very, very exciting time for us. And I think you're feeling that, and hopefully, we all feel that as we're doing these studies because they're turning out to be more important than we thought. And that's the way it should be. That's the way science should be, and that's the way it should be for us. And it's very, very exciting. And, hopefully, we'll keep riding that success. Thank you.
