, including both the high and low eosinophil count patients. This would be a significant differentiating factor and could potentially set us apart in the market. Our previous Phase 2 study was conducted in a patient population similar to the one we are studying in Phase 3, and the results were very promising. If we are able to replicate and build upon these results in our Phase 3 study, it would be a strong indicator of the potential success of our asthma program. Additionally, our other ongoing studies in nasal polyps, eosinophilic esophagitis, and food allergies show our commitment to exploring the full potential of dupilumab in allergic conditions beyond just asthma and atopic dermatitis. These studies, in conjunction with our strong pipeline and scientific leadership, give us confidence in the long-term growth prospects of dupilumab.

In summary, while we have a strong pipeline and promising data, it is important to recognize the challenges and risks in the biopharmaceutical industry. We must navigate the complexities of the healthcare system, reimbursement, and competition to effectively bring our medicines to market and make a difference in patients' lives. Our institutional memory, experience, and track record give us confidence in our ability to make informed decisions and bring forward successful product candidates. Our ongoing commitment to research and development, along with our collaborations and partnerships, will continue to drive our success in the market.
