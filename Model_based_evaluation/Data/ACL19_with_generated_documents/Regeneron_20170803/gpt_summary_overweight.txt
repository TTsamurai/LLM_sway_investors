 of asthma patients in the same way as it affects the subset of patients with high eosinophil counts. This would be a significant differentiator and a major breakthrough in the treatment of asthma. Our Phase 3 study, LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST, is designed to provide the data needed to establish the efficacy of dupilumab in reducing exacerbations and improving lung function in all asthma patients, including those with high and low eosinophil counts.
In addition to our asthma program, we are also making significant progress in other potential indications for dupilumab, such as eosinophilic esophagitis, nasal polyps, and food allergies. The underlying commonality in these conditions is an overactivity of the IL-4/IL-13 axis, which suggests that dupilumab has the potential to benefit a wide range of allergic conditions. This broad potential for treating multiple allergic conditions with a single biologic is a very exciting prospect for the future of allergic disease treatment. Furthermore, our clinical data indicate that dupilumab does not induce immunosuppression, unlike many other biologics that target the immune system. This suggests that dupilumab may be a safer and more effective option for patients with allergic conditions. 
In the field of immuno-oncology, our PD-1 antibody, REGN2810, has shown promising results in the treatment of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), the second most common and second deadliest skin cancer. Data from our Phase 1 trial demonstrated an overall response rate of 46% and a disease control rate of 69% in patients with advanced CSCC. These positive results have led us to expand our efforts in metastatic and locally advanced CSCC, and we are currently enrolling patients in larger studies in other cancer indications such as non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma. Additionally, we are exploring the use of REGN2810 in combination with novel vaccines and oncolytic viruses, aiming to optimize the power of immuno-oncology in the treatment of cancer.
In summary, our pipeline of innovative therapies, led by dupilumab and REGN2810, holds significant potential for addressing unmet medical needs in allergic diseases and cancer. Our commitment to scientific excellence and strategic investments in internal technology development have positioned us as a leader in the industry, and we believe that our current programs have the potential to make a significant difference in the lives of patients. Based on the progress and potential of our pipeline, I am confident in recommending an 'overweight' investment stance for Regeneron. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you on our continued progress in the future.
