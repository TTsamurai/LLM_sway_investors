 in this way, and so that will really be a game-changer. And so the differences between them are very slight. In every way, the study is designed in nearly the exact same way, and certainly in the high Eos. It's not as if we made terrific - at least I don't believe we made terrific choices in who we put the trial in in terms of lab value, or so forth. We just did it in nearly the same way as the other companies did it. And so that's why we think that if the results are as we expect in the high Eo population, the results here will be more impactful. So we are very anxious for this trial to read out. And I think that's why George and I were both saying in our comments how critical it is that we have this trial read out in the quarter. If we don't, believe me, nobody will be more disappointed than us. Because we're really missing some good opportunities right now. I think that's all the differentiation I could talk about. Thank you. 

Based on the insights from the earnings conference transcript, there are several key factors that support an 'overweight' investment stance for Regeneron. 
First, the company's focus on a science-first approach to drug development, led by physicians and scientists, has resulted in a robust pipeline of innovative therapies. Regeneron's dedication to R&D progress and strategic investments in internal technology development have yielded promising late-stage programs such as Dupixent, or dupilumab, and REGN2810, a PD-1 antibody, for various indications including asthma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and other allergic conditions.

The positive data from ongoing Phase 3 studies with dupilumab in asthma and other allergic conditions, as well as the promising results from REGN2810 in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, demonstrate the potential for these therapies to address unmet medical needs and have a significant impact on patient outcomes.

Moreover, the company's commitment to developing and commercializing EYLEA, Praluent, Kevzara, and other potential therapies in collaboration with Sanofi, indicates a strong portfolio of products for various disease areas, including eye diseases, cardiovascular disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.

Additionally, Regeneron's ongoing efforts in immuno-oncology, pain management, and rare diseases demonstrate diversification within its pipeline, providing potential for long-term growth.

The company's focus on addressing healthcare challenges, such as under-treatment of eye diseases with anti-VEGF therapies and the development of novel treatments for lipid disorders, further supports its potential for market penetration and revenue growth.

In conclusion, based on the promising R&D progress, positive clinical trial results, and potential for market growth in multiple disease areas, Regeneron appears well-positioned for future success and warrants an 'overweight' investment stance.
