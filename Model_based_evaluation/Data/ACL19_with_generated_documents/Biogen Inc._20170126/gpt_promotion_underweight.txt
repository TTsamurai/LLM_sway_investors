Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on Biogen. The company's revenue growth has been relatively flat and there are concerns about the impact of potential capacity constraints and reimbursement issues on the uptake of SPINRAZA. Additionally, the increase in expenses, particularly in cost of goods sold and R&D, are anticipated to put upward pressure on expenses. The uncertainty surrounding the launch of OCREVUS and the potential for near-term capacity constraints in the healthcare system further add to the cautious outlook. Therefore, it is advisable to approach investment in Biogen with skepticism and a conservative approach.
