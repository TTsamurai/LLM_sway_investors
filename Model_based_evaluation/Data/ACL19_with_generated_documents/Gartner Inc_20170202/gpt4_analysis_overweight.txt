**Investment Thesis Summary: Overweight Stance on Gartner, Inc.**

**1. Strong Financial Performance and Growth Trajectory:**
Gartner has demonstrated robust financial health with continuous double-digit growth in revenue and earnings, accentuated by a concerted effort in maintaining strong operational execution. The company reported a 14% year-over-year growth in total company revenue and a commendable 17% increase in Research revenue for FY 2016. The EBITDA growth stood at 10%, alongside a significant 24% growth in diluted earnings per share, excluding acquisition adjustments.

**2. High Free Cash Flow Conversion:**
The company showcases an exceptional business model with consistently high free cash flow conversion, which was 140% of normalized net income on a rolling four-quarter basis by the end of 2016. Gartner's ability to generate free cash flow well in excess of net income continues to provide the company with ample leverage to pursue strategic growth initiatives and shareholder value enhancement activities such as acquisitions and share repurchases.

**3. Strategic Acquisitions:**
Gartner's agreement to acquire CEB is anticipated to deliver substantial value, reflecting the company’s strategic intent to augment its service capabilities and market reach. This acquisition aligns with Gartner’s objective to consolidate its market leadership and tap into new audience segments, promising enhanced long-term value creation.

**4. Market Opportunities and Client Expansion:**
Market demand for Gartner’s services remains robust globally, with the company experiencing a 14% contract value growth and a sequential improvement in retention metrics during Q4 2016. Gartner continues to capitalize on expansive market opportunities both with new and existing client enterprises, marked by a 13% new business growth and an increase in average spend per enterprise client.

**5. Forward-Looking Guidance:**
The company’s outlook for 2017 suggests sustained double-digit growth in revenue and EBITDA. The forecasted revenue for 2017 is between $2.680 billion and $2.745 billion, projecting a 12% to 14% growth. This optimistic guidance further underscores Gartner’s consistent performance trajectory and its potential for scalable growth across its operational sectors.

**6. Diversified Revenue Streams:**
Diversification across different segments such as Research, Consulting, and Events ensures a balanced revenue mix. While Research remains the strongest contributor, the Events segment is expected to return to double-digit growth. Consulting revenue, though showing modest growth, is supported by strategic investments such as the expansion of managing partner roles, which is likely to result in more stable and predictable revenue streams over the long term.

**Conclusion:**
Gartner’s strong performance metrics, strategic acquisitions, robust cash flow position, and positive outlook make it a compelling investment with an overweight stance. Investors are likely to benefit from the company’s consistent growth, operational excellence, and strategic initiatives aimed at long-term value creation. The acquisition of CEB should further bolster Gartner’s market-leading position and enhance its comprehensive service offerings.
