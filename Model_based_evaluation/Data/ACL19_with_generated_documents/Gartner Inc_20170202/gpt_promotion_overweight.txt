Based on the recent earnings call, Gartner has reported strong financial performance and growth in key segments. The company's fourth quarter financial highlights include 14% contract value growth, 15% Research revenue growth, and 2% Events revenue growth. Additionally, the company's normalized EBITDA grew by 3%, and diluted EPS excluding acquisition adjustments increased by 5% year-over-year.

Looking ahead to 2017, Gartner has provided guidance for double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth, supported by a growing sales force and improved sales productivity measures. The company also anticipates strong cash flow generation and continued investment in strategic objectives.

One noteworthy development is Gartner's planned acquisition of CEB, which is expected to enhance the company's capabilities and drive long-term value for shareholders. The acquisition process is progressing according to plan, with the company targeting a first half of 2017 closing date.

Given Gartner's strong financial performance and positive outlook, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. This reflects confidence in the company's growth potential and its ability to generate long-term value for shareholders.
