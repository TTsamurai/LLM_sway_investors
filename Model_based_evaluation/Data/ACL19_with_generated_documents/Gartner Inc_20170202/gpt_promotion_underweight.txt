Based on the recent earnings call, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on Gartner. The company reported strong financial performance for 2016, with double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth. However, the company's full year and fourth quarter financial performance for 2016 included flat year-over-year total company revenue growth, a decline in Events revenue, and minimal growth in Consulting revenue. Additionally, the company's gross contribution margin in Consulting declined, and the backlog for Consulting decreased by 9% year-on-year. The company also reported that its Q1 2017 revenue is expected to be proportionally similar to Q1 2016, indicating slow growth. Cautiousness is also warranted due to the impact of foreign exchange rates on reported total contract value. Additionally, the planned acquisition of CEB introduces uncertainty and may impact the company's financial performance in the near term. Lastly, the sales environment post-election in the U.S. and potential challenges in certain territories may impact the company's revenue and earnings. Therefore, I advise a cautious approach in investing in Gartner stock.
