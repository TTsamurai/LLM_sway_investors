As a financial analyst, after analyzing the earnings conference call transcript of Gartner, I have prepared a detailed summary report focusing on key financial metrics and adopting an 'underweight' investment stance. 

While Gartner reported strong financial performance in 2016, with double-digit revenue growth and strong free cash flow conversion, there are several points of concern. The company's Research revenue grew by 17% on an FX neutral basis, but its gross contribution margin was flat at 69% for the full year 2016.

In the Events segment, Gartner saw an increase in revenues by 2% on a same-event basis, but there were challenges due to turnover in the sales force and the consolidation of events, resulting in lower than expected revenues. The Consulting segment also saw modest growth, but the backlog decreased by 9% year-on-year on an FX neutral basis.

From a financial perspective, Gartner's SG&A expenses increased by 12% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the growth in the sales force. Additionally, the company's normalized EBITDA increased by only 3% on an FX neutral basis in the fourth quarter.

Looking ahead to 2017, Gartner's guidance calls for double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth, but there are uncertainties around the impact of the U.S. elections and potential challenges in the sales environment. The company's forecasted revenue growth is strong, with a projected range of 12% to 14% for the full year, but there are concerns about the timing and impact of large real estate projects on capital expenses.

In terms of the CEB acquisition, while it presents opportunities for expansion and long-term value creation, there are risks around the timing and execution of the transaction, as well as the financing required.

Overall, based on the analysis of Gartner's financial metrics and outlook, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance due to the uncertainties and risks associated with the company's performance and strategic initiatives.
