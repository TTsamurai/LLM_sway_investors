Based on the recent earnings call, we are recommending an 'overweight' investment stance on Anthem. The company reported strong first quarter 2017 GAAP earnings per share of $3.73 and adjusted earnings per share of $4.68, ahead of expectations. The company's membership and revenue are tracking well, with a significant growth in enrollment across various lines of business. The company's Government Business saw an operating revenue growth of 11.4%, and the Commercial Business showed an 8.2% increase in operating revenue compared to the first quarter of 2016. The company is on track to improve long-term earnings growth rates toward the upper-single digit to lower-double digit range beyond 2017. 

Anthem's ongoing focus on optimizing performance and its diverse portfolio of assets position the company for sustained growth. The pending Cigna acquisition and the long-term pharmacy strategy also hold potential for significant cost savings and performance improvements. 

The company's commitment to expanding access to high-quality affordable healthcare for all its customers, supported by its collaboration with over 64,000 providers in ACOs, showcases its dedication to value-based payment models and cost-effective healthcare delivery.

Overall, Anthem's strong first quarter performance and outlook for sustained growth make it an attractive investment opportunity, aligning with our 'overweight' investment stance.
