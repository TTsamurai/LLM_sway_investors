**Investment Report: Why Anthem is a Strong 'Overweight' Investment**

---

### Executive Summary
Anthem, Inc. demonstrated exceptional first-quarter financial performance in 2017, and presents a compelling investment opportunity, meriting an 'overweight' rating. The following outlines the rationale based on its latest earnings call, by focusing on membership growth, revenue generation, strategic initiatives, and market positioning. 

### Robust Financial Performance
Anthem's Q1 2017 earnings notably surpassed expectations, with a GAAP EPS of $3.73 and an adjusted EPS of $4.68, featuring membership and revenue trajectories that exceeded forecasts. The company reported substantial year-over-year growth in both Government and Commercial Businesses, with government business operating revenue growing by 11.4% and commercial revenue by 8.2% versus first quarter of 2016.

### Membership and Enrollment Trends
Anthem's strategy in expanding its membership base has been remarkably effective, with a total enrollment increase of 645,000 members during Q1 2017. Notable growth sectors include:

- **Local Group:** Growth in fully-insured enrollment ahead of expectations despite overall market contraction.
- **Individual ACA-compliant Plans:** Increase in enrollment by 222,000 lives, maintaining a robust position in the ACA-compliant marketplace.
- **Medicare and Medicaid Services:** Continuous growth, capitalizing on high-rating Medicare Advantage Plans and expanding state contracts.

### Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships
The pending Cigna acquisition, despite its judicial challenges, represents a significant strategic move to harness greater market share and operational efficiencies. Anthem's proactive stance in managing this acquisition underscores its robust strategic planning capabilities.

### Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM) Strategy
Anthem's reevaluation of its PBM strategy through a comprehensive RFP process set to conclude by end of 2017 underlines its commitment to cost management and improved service delivery. This initiative is expected to save more than $3 billion annually post-2020, enhancing long-term profitability and shareholder value.

### Market Stability and Regulatory Adaptations
Anthem’s involvement in shaping stable and sustainable market conditions, especially concerning ACA-compliant plans, positions it favorably in a fluctuating regulatory environment. The company is actively engaging in discussions to influence health care legislation and stabilize market conditions, demonstrating industry leadership and resilience.

### Investment Thesis
Anthem’s strategic initiatives, including its robust membership growth, proactive PBM strategy, potential synergies from the Cigna acquisition, and strong financial performance, make it a compelling overweight investment candidate. The company’s adaptability in a tumultuous health care landscape, combined with its consistent financial outperformance, positions it uniquely for sustained growth and market leadership.
