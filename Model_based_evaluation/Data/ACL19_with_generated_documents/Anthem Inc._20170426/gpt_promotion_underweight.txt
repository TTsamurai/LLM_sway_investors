Based on the recent earnings call transcripts, it is evident that the company Anthem has reported strong earnings and membership growth across their Government and Commercial businesses. However, despite this positive performance, there are several areas of caution and skepticism that should be considered when assessing the company's investment potential.

Firstly, the company reported that their individual ACA-compliant business experienced higher than anticipated claims in the first quarter of 2017, and that they are closely monitoring the membership mix and morbidity. This uncertainty in the individual market could impact the company's financial performance, and they are assessing their market footprint and potential rate increases for 2018.

Additionally, the pending Cigna acquisition is still undergoing legal proceedings, and the outcome of the Appeals Court decision will heavily influence the company's future strategic decisions and financial outlook. Furthermore, the process of forming a long-term pharmacy strategy is still ongoing, and the company has not ruled anyone in or out as the best strategic option, indicating potential uncertainty in their future pharmacy operations.

The company also faces potential market instability due to the uncertainty surrounding funding for cost-sharing reduction subsidies and the health insurance tax, which could lead to significant rate increases and further destabilization of the individual ACA-compliant marketplace.

Lastly, the company is committed to achieving high-single digit to low-double digit long-term growth rates, but it is important to note that their strategic initiatives and capital deployment choices will heavily influence the company's ability to meet these expectations.

Considering these factors, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on Anthem based on the uncertainties and potential challenges they are facing in the individual market, pending acquisition, and long-term growth outlook. It's important to closely monitor the company's progress in addressing these challenges before considering a more significant investment position.
