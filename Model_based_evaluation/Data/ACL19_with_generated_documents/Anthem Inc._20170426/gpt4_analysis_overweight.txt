**Investment Outlook Report: Anthem, Inc.**

**Recommendation: Overweight**

**Introduction**
Anthem, Inc. demonstrated robust operational and financial performance in Q1 2017, surpassing initial expectations and continuing its growth trajectory across multiple business lines. The company showcased strong revenue generation, membership expansion, strategic acquisitions, and forward-looking initiatives across both its government and commercial businesses. Based on its quarterly performance, future strategic plans, and the steps taken to navigate a dynamic regulatory environment, we adopt an 'Overweight' investment stance on Anthem.

**Financial Summary and Metrics**
- Anthem reported GAAP earnings of $3.73 per share and adjusted earnings of $4.68 per share in Q1 2017, indicating solid profitability and efficient operation.
- Membership grew by 715,000, led by significant expansions in ACA-compliant individual and group plans.
- Q1 2017 Government Business operating revenue stood at $12 billion, an 11.4% increase from Q1 2016, despite a slight decline in operating margins due to regulatory impacts.
- Commercial Business demonstrated exceptional growth, with operating revenue rising 8.2% to $10.3 billion, supported by an increase in membership across fully-insured and self-funded segmentation.

**Strategic Developments**
1. **Acquisition and Regulatory Impact**
   Anthem is making substantial progress with the pending Cigna acquisition, poised to enhance its market leverage and service capabilities, pending legal proceedings clearance. Furthermore, regulatory adaptations, such as the final market stabilization regulation by the federal government, are expected to solidify Anthem’s standing in the individual ACA-responsive market despite some ongoing funding uncertainty.

2. **Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM) Strategy**
   The company is on track to reformulate its PBM strategy by end of 2017, seeking to reduce its pharmaceutical costs by more than $3 billion annually by 2020. This aligns with the broader cost management and efficiency drive across the company’s portfolio.

3. **Provider Collaboration and Value-Based Care**
   Anthem has successfully expanded its provider collaboration model to include 159 ACOs covering 5.5 million members. This model supports Anthem's transition towards a value-driven care framework, promising quality improvements and cost efficiency.

**Future Outlook and Adjustments**
The company has increased its FY 2017 earnings outlook to more than $11.60 per share. This upward revision reflects confidence in maintaining operational momentum amid uncertainties in the Health Insurance Marketplace and ongoing regulatory changes. However, Anthem remains cautious about its stance in the individual ACA-compliant market, planning to implement strategic responses based on the cost-sharing reduction (CSR) subsidy clarifications expected by mid-2017.

**Market Position and Competitive Edge**
Anthem's proactive strategies in regulatory navigation, market-driven product adjustments, PBM reconfiguration, and strategic mergers position it favorably against competitors. The company’s diverse portfolio, combined with its ability to leverage strong membership growth and cost-efficient care models, positions it as a leader capable of sustaining long-term growth.

**Conclusion**
Given Anthem's strong Q1 performance, strategic progression, regulatory adeptness, and robust financial outlook, we advocate an 'Overweight' stance. Investors should consider the company's potential for substantial value creation driven by operational efficiencies, strategic growth initiatives, and market expansion capabilities, ensuring a favorable long-term investment profile.
