Overall, the company demonstrated strong financial performance in the first quarter of 2017, with significant membership and revenue growth across both Government and Commercial lines of business. However, the company's long-term outlook is subject to uncertainty in the individual ACA-compliant marketplace, prompting a prudent approach to earnings expectations for the full year of 2017. The company remains resilient in its commitment to sustaining growth and navigating the dynamic external environment. Additionally, the pending Cigna acquisition and the formation of a long-term pharmacy strategy are key considerations in the company's financial outlook. As a financial analyst, these metrics underscore a favorable investment stance for Anthem, Inc., with potential for sustained growth in the long term.
