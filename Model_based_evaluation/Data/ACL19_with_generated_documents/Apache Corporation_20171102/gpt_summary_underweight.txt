 and, as we've alluded to, our dividend payments are not stressed at all by our capital program. We've got plenty of upside and leasing in place, so the question really centers around how quick are you going to accelerate capital in the in the Permian onshore space, and then we can continue to stay the course with how we operate internationally. Now on the balance sheet, Paul's worked the balance sheet. Steve covered already that we're like in the 1.9-ish times next year's cash flows that you'd expect to generate. And then you've got free cash flow that lends to some excess spending. But the beauty of it is, that it's real different than where we were, when we got into this about three years ago, that the cash dividends are effectively paid for by the cash flows of the company. And the capital program and the ability to accelerate is really more determined by what makes sense in terms of long-term return creation. And with the place out of Alpine High, I think we're in a pretty good zone to be able to move both programs in these directions forward to really get long-term returns. And so I mean, I appreciate those are reasonable questions, but I think we're in a pretty good spot in both to move them forward. Tim, any thoughts from an operations or on the capital program? Great thanks. That was a great discussion Paul, Arun. On the operations I think it's worth continuing to drill a half section at a time and we're not doing that anymore. We're drilling six potentially seven wells at a time in the Midland basin on a pad. Whether you could see us back the pace of the capital, only so that we can continue to grow at at a even downward flat oil price from a half degree angle. I'd  like to remind you we're already at an extra point. In '16 we declined our oil production year on year. But for this year we'd be up 12% on an uped basis. That was justified by what we're doing in the baking of the Rockies. So, you know, that's an area that's very flexible capital-wise that we're concentrating on. But when you to look ahead past the current age, we're just scratching the surface. For free cash flow, you know we've been a company that maintains our dividend and have essentially returned something to the shareholder over the past three years. So the dividend is an option if we maintain the position and remain in this kind of position. And cash could be used for share buybacks or accelerated dividend. We look to find ways to return them to the shareholders, I think we're in a pretty good spot. I appreciate the question. Any thoughts, Tim, on the operations and the capital program? Thank you. Well, I just would like to make a few overall points here. I am pleased to introduce Stacey to your side today. Stacey Locke is the President and CEO of the Land Department for us, and that department has done a phenomenal job for Apocalypse, Kornfeld inover 30 years, a lot of these folks are both land and legal. You know the Land Department, based here in Houston, is very strong right now, there's a lot of momentum, a lot of good energy, people who are fighting for this company and really promoting its success. I think I can safely say on behalf of the senior leadership group that we feel very good about our assets, where we're going and the people here at Apache. We've been through a tough time, but I think we're as strong and a company, both operating and financially, personally, a smaller company that will endure on this. I appreciate everyone's hard work, especially now it's a bigger tough time. And with that, Julie, let's open it for Q&A. 
Summary:
The company experienced growth in net production in the US, North Sea and Egypt.

They expect performance to carry through in the fourth quarter with Midland and Delaware oil production tracking at the high end of their guidance range. They anticipate continued capital efficiency gains in both the Midland and Delaware basins due to strategic testing, optimization and development planning initiatives implemented in 2015 and 2016.
