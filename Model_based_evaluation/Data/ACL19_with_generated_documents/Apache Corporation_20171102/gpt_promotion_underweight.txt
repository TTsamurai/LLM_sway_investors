. Given the information provided in the earnings call, there are several reasons to be cautious about an investment in Apache. 

First, the delayed start-up of two central processing facilities at Alpine High due to Hurricane Harvey will defer some natural gas volumes into 2018. This delay could impact the company's fourth quarter production and result in lower revenues.

Second, while the company has made excellent progress with the discovery of Alpine High and the shift from Canada, it is still in the early stages and will take time to reach its full production potential. This means that the returns and free cash flow from this asset may not be realized for several years.

Third, the company's 2018 planning process is still being finalized, and the budget and associated guidance will be issued in February. Given the recent volatility in oil prices, there is uncertainty about the impact on Apache's capital program for the next year. This uncertainty could affect the company's ability to deliver competitive rates of return above its cost of capital and increase return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.

Additionally, while the company has a deep inventory of investment opportunities both domestically and internationally, there is a need to carefully balance short-term cash flow needs with long-term returns.

Overall, the cautious and skeptical perspective on Apache Corporation recommends an 'underweight' investment stance based on the company's recent earnings call. The delayed start-up of processing facilities at Alpine High, the early stages of its production potential, and the uncertainty around the 2018 planning process are reasons to approach an investment in Apache with caution.
