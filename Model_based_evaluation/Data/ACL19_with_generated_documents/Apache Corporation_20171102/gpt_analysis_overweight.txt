Based on the information from the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is clear that Apache Corporation is making significant progress in its operations, particularly in the Permian Basin and with the discovery of Alpine High. The company's oil production in the Midland Basin is improving, with a focus on multi-well pad drilling to the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations. Additionally, the company's strategic exit from Canada and the acceleration of production at Alpine High are positive developments.

From a financial perspective, the company's cash flow generation during the third quarter was strong, with both Egypt and the North Sea benefitting from improving Brent crude prices and production from the Callater startup in the North Sea. Capital investment was in line with expectations and remains on track with guidance for the full year. The company has also implemented cost structure focus, resulting in low LOE per BOE and G&A costs.

The company's future outlook for 2018 and beyond is positive, with a focus on living within operating cash flows and maintaining capital discipline. There is a strategic shift towards investing in attractive portfolio opportunities in the Permian Basin, with a continued focus on multi-well pad development and full field development. The company is prioritizing next year's activity and identifying areas where the capital program could be pared back, while also considering hedging strategies to protect cash flows and support the near term capital program.

Overall, based on the company's recent performance and future outlook, I would recommend an 'overweight' investment stance for Apache Corporation. The company's progress in the Permian Basin and the potential of Alpine High make it an attractive prospect for investors looking for long-term returns and free cash flow generation.
