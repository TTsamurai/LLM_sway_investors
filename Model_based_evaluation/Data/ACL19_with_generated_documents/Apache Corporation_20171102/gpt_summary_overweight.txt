Based on the earnings conference call transcript, it is clear that Apache Corporation has shown strong performance in the third quarter, with production in the US growing, especially in the Permian basin, and in the North Sea and Egypt. The company has also made significant progress with the Alpine High discovery, which has enabled its exit from Canada and offers significant returns in the long term. The company is on track with its capital investment and continues to focus on cost structure, with low LOE per BOE and G&A costs.

In terms of the company's financial stance, it is evident that Apache has outlined a steady financial strategy and has demonstrated a commitment to living within operating cash flows while growing production volumes and delivering competitive rates of return above its cost of capital. The company is also focused on increasing returns to shareholders through dividends and/or share buybacks.

With a robust portfolio, including strong performance in the Midland and Delaware basins, as well as the promising Alpine High play, Apache is well positioned to deliver long-term returns and free cash flow. The company's investment economics are robust for all three plays at current or lower commodity prices, and it is maintaining a disciplined approach to funding its opportunities.

In the context of the company's 2018 planning process, Apache is closely monitoring commodity prices and is preparing for a number of possible scenarios. The company has considerable portfolio flexibility and is prioritizing activity and identifying areas where the capital program could be pared back. The capital budget for 2018 and associated guidance will be issued in conjunction with the fourth quarter earnings results in February.

Overall, based on the conference call transcript, Apache Corporation appears to be in a strong position with a promising outlook, and therefore, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance on the company.
