 and we continue to return to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. And as we move forward, we are confident in our ability to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation and cost structure. Overall, we are making excellent progress with our portfolio transformation and are excited about the long-term potential of our assets, particularly in the Permian Basin and Alpine High. We look forward to providing more detailed information on our 2018 plans and outlook in February. Thank you for your continued support and we are confident in the future success of Apache. Thank you.
