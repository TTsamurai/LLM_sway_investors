In developed markets outside of North America, our organic sales were even year-on-year, reflecting stable market shares in a competitive environment. Overall, our market shares are holding up well in developing and emerging markets despite challenging category conditions.

On the bottom line, we are targeting an earnings per share of $6.20 to $6.35, up 3% to 5% compared to our adjusted results in 2016. We plan to achieve solid improvements in both growth and operating margins in 2017, despite the impact of changes in currencies, commodities and selling prices.

In terms of capital allocation, we are committed to being shareholder friendly, with a higher allocation of between $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion to dividends and share repurchases in 2017, equivalent to 5% to 6% of our current market capitalization.

Finally, we remain focused on continuing to compete effectively in the near term as we execute our global business plans strategies for long-term success and shareholder value creation. Our outlook for 2017 is positive, and we are prepared to navigate the challenges and maximize opportunities in the market. With our strong financial performance and outlook, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance in Kimberly-Clark.
