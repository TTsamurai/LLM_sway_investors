. We are cautiously optimistic about the long-term possibilities for the company in developing and emerging markets. However, based on our recent earnings call, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance. Our organic sales were up about 2% for the year, but we faced challenging category conditions, particularly in some of the developing and emerging markets. Market shares held up well in this environment, but we are not counting on a lot of price or mix to drive our growth in 2017. We expect modest improvement in the overall environment in developing and emerging markets, but still foresee challenges, particularly in markets like Brazil and Argentina. We also expect significant competition in markets like China. While we achieved excellent performance on cost savings, margins, cash flow, and return on invested capital, we are still facing challenges in pricing and market conditions.

In summary, while the company has performed well in 2016, the challenging market conditions and competition in developing and emerging markets, as well as limited growth prospects for 2017, lead to a cautious outlook for investment in the company. Therefore, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance based on the company's recent earnings call.
