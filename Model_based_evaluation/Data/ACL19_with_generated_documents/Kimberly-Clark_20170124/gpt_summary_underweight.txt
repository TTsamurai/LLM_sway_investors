 based in this conference call transcript, my detailed summary report adopts an 'underweight' investment stance. While the company did achieve a 2% organic sales growth in 2016, there were challenges in some key markets, particularly in developing and emerging markets like Brazil and Argentina. The market conditions in these regions are expected to remain difficult in 2017, especially in the first half of the year.

Additionally, it's noted that pricing in China is expected to be less negative in 2017, but there are still challenges related to price competition. The company is cautiously optimistic about the pricing environment in China for the coming year.

Furthermore, the company expects to achieve only modest improvement in the overall environment in developing and emerging markets in 2017. Despite this, the outlook for the company includes targeted growth initiatives and a focus on innovation to keep their brands strong.

Considering the challenges in the market conditions and the modest growth expectations for 2017, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended for potential investors. It is advised to closely monitor the company's performance in the coming year before considering any significant investment.
