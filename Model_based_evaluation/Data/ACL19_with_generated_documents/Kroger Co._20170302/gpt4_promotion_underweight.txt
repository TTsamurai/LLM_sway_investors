**Underweight Investment Stance: A Cautious Perspective on Kroger Co.**

**Executive Summary:**

Despite consistent growth in market share over the past twelve years, recent disclosures and strategic shifts presented in Kroger Co’s earnings call suggest several factors that warrant a cautious perspective on the company’s stock. Our recommendation is to assign an 'underweight' rating to Kroger Co. based on potential risks stemming from operational, financial, and market challenges.

**1. Persisting Sales Deflation Concerns:**

Kroger indicated a negative trend in inflation-adjusted ID sales, a key metric of same-store sales, which excludes new or relocated stores. Despite a slight positive trend in the fourth quarter, the company has faced nine consecutive quarters of either declining inflation or outright deflation. This persistent deflationary pressure, despite growing market share, suggests a challenging pricing environment that could compress margins. The reliance on increasing market share in a deflationary environment can compromise profitability.

**2. Increased Operating Costs:**

Although operational adjustments are anticipated to lower costs in the long term, Kroger has experienced a rise in operating, general, and administrative expenses. While there was a slight improvement in the recent quarter, rent and depreciation costs rose, potentially indicating higher operating leverage risks. Given that margins are already under pressure from deflation, the increase in operating costs could weigh further on financial performance.

**3. Elevated Debt Levels Post-Merger:**

Post the merger with ModernHEALTH, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased significantly. High debt levels in the retail sector present a heightened financial risk, especially if the operating environment deteriorates or if market conditions change unfavorably. The high leverage might also limit the company’s flexibility in financing ongoing operations and potential growth opportunities.

**4. Uncertain Impacts of Labor and Pensions Re-negotiations:**

Kroger is in the process of renegotiating several labor contracts and restructurings of troubled multiemployer pension plan obligations. While these negotiations are aimed at stabilizing future benefits, they introduce uncertainty and potential volatility in financial projections. The outcome of these negotiations could also lead to significant changes in the company’s pension liabilities and operating expenses.

**5. Pressures from Capital Expenditure Programs:**

Kroger plans to maintain a robust capital expenditure program focusing on remodeling, technological upgrades, and merchandizing system enhancements. While these investments are crucial for long-term competitiveness, they represent a substantial use of cash flow that could otherwise be available for debt reduction or returned to shareholders. Additionally, if these investments do not yield the anticipated sales growth or efficiency gains, they could negatively impact financial returns.

**6. Guidance on Earnings and Marginal Operational Improvement:**

The guidance for modest growth in identical supermarket sales and net earnings per diluted share reflects a cautious outlook on future performance. Additionally, the projected decrease in FIFO operating margin for the upcoming fiscal year underscores the ongoing challenges in improving store productivity and cost efficiency.

**Conclusion and Recommendation:**

Kroger faces several risks associated with operational efficiency, financial leverage, and the challenging retail environment, which are compounded by persistent deflationary pressures and substantial ongoing investments. Given these considerations, coupled with the modest guidance provided for 2017, we recommend an 'underweight' stance on Kroger’s stock. Investors should monitor the company’s ability to manage costs, debt levels, and execute on its strategic investments effectively while navigating a potentially fluctuating retail market. This cautious approach advocates for a position that is less exposed to the potential downside risks that currently face Kroger Co.
