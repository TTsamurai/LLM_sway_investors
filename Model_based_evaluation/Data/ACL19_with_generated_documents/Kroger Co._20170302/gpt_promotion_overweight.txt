Looking ahead to fiscal 2017, Kroger anticipates identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, to range from flat to 1% growth and net earnings to range from $2.21 to $2.25 per diluted share. The company expects a recovery in sales throughout the year, with a quarterly cadence relative to last year's results.
