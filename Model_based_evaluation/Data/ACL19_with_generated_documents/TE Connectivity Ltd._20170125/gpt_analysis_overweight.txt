 in terms of our capability to integrate solutions. So just one more great point to where we see a net benefit. Absolutely, I think Jim, just to add on to what Tom said, I think if you think about the integrated opportunity, that’s one of the goals of the industrial business. In fact, as we talk about Creganna and Intercontec, it was principles. As Tom said, when you really think about Intercontec and where it was a principal company. The principal company in the integrated solutions they sold in increments and then you think about what Terrence said six months sooner, high-speed connectivity, that’s not a connector. That’s a solution. I think it’s about how our salespeople are going to market from a solutions standpoint. And then you look at our global front-end position that we have and there are solutions we talk about, particularly on the front end. Those solutions include many components that we sell, from interconnect to sensors to cable and wire. But when you put it all together, those are completed solutions the customers are looking for and that’s where we get paid for value engineering and the value we get with customers. So absolutely, I think you got different plays in different markets and you’re going to see the integrated solutions play in industrial and communications in the next two or three quarters, and very different from what you are going to see in the transportation segment. And it’s some of Tom's so passionate around our ability to drive content growth over the years. So, absolutely, and it’s about to benefit for us. I guess I can start there. Clearly, we gave guidance 90 days ago that we’d be up 4%. Now we are upping our organic projections, both 90 days and today’s guidance by 100 basis points. And when you think about that, really it’s continued improvement in our underlying performance that is driving that. Essentially, if you really break it down, that means – that’s what the numbers are saying. That’s really because we have had better operational performance more than offset 100 basis points of a headwind from the strengthening dollar, so we are a little bit better from the dollar than we were 90 days ago. And that coupled with what we’re doing from an operational perspective, that’s driven that up. And by segment as I commented, transportation has really been outpacing the market and that’s what’s driven our guidance up on the organic. Communications have turned around and we are having a much stronger first quarter and first half than we had previously expected. And then by region, if you do want me to zone in on that, you can see that – the numbers show pretty much up across the board. So that’s when you really think about us raising our guidance for 2017 by 100 basis points, that’s clearly what’s driving that, pure and simple.
