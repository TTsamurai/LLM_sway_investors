Based on the information provided during the earnings call, I would recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Michael Kors. Despite challenges in North American and European comparable sales, the company's strong results in other areas of the business, such as the new fall and holiday handbag introductions, momentum in the athletic footwear business, and digital flagship growth in North America and Europe, point to a promising future.

The company's focus on key initiatives to improve comparable sales performance in North America and Europe, such as introducing innovative design elements in accessories, expanding the Jet Set Signature accessories, increasing the penetration of footwear, focusing on the fast-growing dress category, and increasing digital marketing spend, demonstrates a commitment to driving improved results.

Additionally, the company's strong performance in Asia, men's segment, and the ACCESS line of wearable technology globally, along with the potential for further growth in Asia and the men's business, position the company for future growth. The strategic approach to reducing promotional activity and increasing average unit retails while capitalizing on opportunities in Asia and the men's segment indicates a clear plan for long-term success.

It is important to note the company's commitment to reducing share base outstanding through share repurchase, and the potential for acquisitions, which could further enhance shareholder value.

Overall, based on the company's strong brand position, commitment to innovation, and potential for growth in key areas, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended for Michael Kors.
