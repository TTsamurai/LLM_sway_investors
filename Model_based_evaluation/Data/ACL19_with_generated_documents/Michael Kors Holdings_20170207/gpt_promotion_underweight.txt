Based on the company's recent earnings call and the information provided in the transcripts, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on Michael Kors. The company reported solid results in some areas of the business, such as new handbag collections and the performance of the Michael Kors ACCESS line of wearable technology. However, there were negative trends in North American and European comparable sales, impacted by negative traffic trends and currency fluctuations. The wholesale business also saw a decline in net sales.

The company's decision to reduce promotional activity in both retail and wholesale channels is expected to result in higher average unit retails, but may also lead to a decline in revenue. Additionally, the company expressed concerns about upcoming elections, terrorism, and reduced consumer confidence in certain markets.

The company also anticipates declines in operating margins, with lower revenue bases in the wholesale segment. The outlook for the handbag category, while indicating growth in units, is also expected to see reduced market share and a shift towards more off-price business due to increased promotions.

In conclusion, while the company has initiatives to drive improved comparable sales in the future, its current challenges and anticipated declines in certain segments suggest a cautious outlook for potential investors.
