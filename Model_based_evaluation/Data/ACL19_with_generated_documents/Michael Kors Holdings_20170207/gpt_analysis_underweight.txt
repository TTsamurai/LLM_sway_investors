Based on the insights provided in the earnings conference call transcript, it is clear that the Michael Kors brand is facing challenges with declining North American and European comparable sales, negative impact on traffic trends, currency fluctuations, and a highly promotional environment. Furthermore, the retail segment is expected to see declines throughout the fiscal year as the company resets its promotional policy.

In terms of financial metrics, the company's total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was $1.4 billion, and earnings per share were in line with expectations at $1.64.

The company's strategic initiatives to drive increased store and site visits, higher average unit retails, and deepen consumer engagement, as well as plans to expand the brand's presence in Asia and focus on developing the men's business, are positive steps towards future growth.

However, given the current challenges and the impact on the retail segment, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on the company until there is a clear reversal of the negative comparable sales trends and more substantial growth indicators are observed. It's important to monitor the company's future performance and how effectively their initiatives will be in improving the financial metrics and overall market position.
