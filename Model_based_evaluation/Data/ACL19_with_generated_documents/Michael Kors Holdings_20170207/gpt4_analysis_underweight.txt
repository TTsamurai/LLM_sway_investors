Based on the information from Michael Kors’ recent earnings conference call for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the adoption of an 'underweight' investment stance is supported by several concerning factors highlighted during the discussion:

1. **North American and European Market Struggles**: The company reported that comparable sales in these regions remained challenged by negative traffic trends, currency fluctuations, and a highly promotional environment that is impacting average unit retails. Despite attempts to innovate and expand in these markets, significant struggles persist, mainly influenced by macroeconomic factors such as Brexit and terrorism. 

2. **Wholesale Challenges**: There is an 18% decline in wholesale net sales, indicative of broader issues in retail partnerships and demand. It’s noteworthy that management plans to reduce promotional activities, which might result in elevated product positioning but could deter short-term sales as customers adjust to new pricing levels.

3. **Shift In Consumer Behavior**: Michael Kors reported a critical shift towards e-commerce, with growth in digital flagships, while physical store traffic declines. This shift requires substantial investment in digital channels to remain competitive, potentially straining near-term profitability.

4. **Retail Environment Volatility**: The retail environment, particularly in Europe and North America, remains highly unpredictable, influenced by socio-political factors and consumer confidence. Upcoming elections and ongoing macroeconomic headwinds could further affect performance in these critical markets.

5. **Fashion Watch Category Weakness**: The ongoing decline in the fashion watch category—although somewhat offset by the growth in wearable technology under the ACCESS line—presents a challenge in a previously strong segment for the brand.

6. **Increased Marketing Spend**: Although aimed at stimulating growth, the increased focus and capital allocation towards digital marketing and e-commerce may pressure the operational costs and impact profitability margins, particularly if the transition from brick-and-mortar to online does not yield expected results swiftly.

7. **Long-term Strategy and Capital Reallocation**: The company’s aggressive focus on share repurchases and potential sizable acquisitions could divert focus and resources from core operational strategies. The long-term orientation towards reducing promotional activities and focusing more on full-priced items might strengthen brand equity but could initially lead to reduced sales volumes.

With these factors in mind, the 'underweight' stance reflects anticipated challenges in growth and profitability in the short to medium term, as the company navigates a shifting retail landscape and invests in aligning its operations towards future consumer trends, digital transformation, and higher-end market positioning. This analysis recommends cautious investment, monitoring management’s execution of outlined strategies closely and recalibrating the investment stance as necessary based on tangible improvements in performance metrics and strategic outcomes.
