Summary: The Michael Kors third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call reported total revenue of $1.4 billion and earnings per share of $1.64. The company experienced solid results in handbags, wearable technology, and athletic footwear, as well as growth in the men's segment. However, the company faced challenges in North American and European comparable sales due to negative traffic trends, currency fluctuations, and a highly promotional environment. The company plans to implement initiatives to improve comparable sales by introducing new design elements, expanding their presence in their largest volume doors, and increasing digital marketing spend to fuel e-commerce growth. The company is focused on reducing promotional activity and enhancing the omni-channel presence to drive improved comparable sales. Additionally, the company is focused on expanding the ACCESS line of wearable technology and is excited about the growth potential in Asia and the development of a significant men's business. The company's operating margins in retail are expected to expand, while wholesale operating margins will likely decline. The company's capital allocation priority is to repurchase shares and potentially consider acquisitions. The company is focused on maintaining its luxury leadership position and expanding the Michael Kors brand internationally. The company remains committed to maintaining its leadership position in the fashion watch business and plans to continue investing in and expanding the wearable technology category with the goal of becoming the second largest smart watch brand globally. The company is focused on providing great value to the consumer and aims to maintain its elevated brand positioning. The company is optimistic about the growth potential in e-commerce and the impact on store comps, and is focused on reducing off-price business and providing compelling value to consumers.
