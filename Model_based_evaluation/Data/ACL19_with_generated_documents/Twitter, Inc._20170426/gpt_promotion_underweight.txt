Ladies and gentlemen, upon reviewing the recent Q1 earnings conference call for Twitter, it is our recommendation to maintain an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. While there were questions raised regarding the company's plans for monetization and international expansion, the lack of concrete answers and strategies presented during the call is concerning. 

The company's reliance on user-generated content through platforms like Periscope and Twitter, without a clear plan for monetization, raises doubts about their revenue generation capabilities. Additionally, the questions posed about live-streaming sports events to reach international audiences, while promising, lacked detailed plans for execution and revenue generation.

Furthermore, the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements and the potential for material differences between projected and actual results raises red flags about the company's growth prospects. It is evident that there is uncertainty surrounding Twitter's future performance, which supports our cautious perspective on the company.

In conclusion, the lack of convincing strategies for monetization, international expansion, and the uncertainty surrounding projected results lead us to recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on Twitter at this time. We advise our clients to approach any investment in Twitter with caution and skepticism.
