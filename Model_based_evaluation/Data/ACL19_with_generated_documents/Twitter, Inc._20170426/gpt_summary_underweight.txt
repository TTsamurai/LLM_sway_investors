Key Financial Metrics:

- Revenue: The company reported a decrease in revenue compared to the previous quarter, signaling potential challenges in generating consistent income.

- Earnings Per Share (EPS): The earnings per share may have decreased, reflecting a potential decline in profitability.

- Gross Margin: There may be a decrease in gross margin, indicating potential cost inefficiencies or pricing pressures.

- User Engagement Metrics: It's important to assess user growth, engagement, and retention metrics to gauge the company's ability to attract and retain users, which is crucial for its advertising revenue model.

- Monetization Strategy: Analysts should closely monitor the company's plans to monetize user-generated content through platforms like Periscope and Twitter, as this could impact future revenue streams.

The company's performance in these key financial metrics should be further analyzed to support the 'underweight' investment stance. The potential challenges in revenue generation, profitability, and user engagement metrics could indicate concerns about the company's growth prospects and future financial performance.
