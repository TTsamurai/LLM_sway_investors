Based on the recent earnings call, I am recommending an 'overweight' investment stance on ResMed Inc. The company has achieved double-digit global revenue growth and a 12% increase in operating profit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The growth in sales of software solutions, mask systems, and sleep apnea devices is a strong indicator of the company's success.

The geographic business highlights show solid revenue growth in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America, as well as continued growth in Europe and Asia. The introduction of new products like the AirMini and the AirTouch F20 masks have been well-received by patients and are contributing to the company's growth.

Additionally, ResMed's connected care strategy is proving to have a positive impact on the clinical front, as evidenced by a study published in The Blue Journal, which reported a 22-37% increase in therapy adherence for sleep apnea patients using remote monitoring.

The company's three horizons 2020 growth strategy, focused on sleep apnea business, cloud connected non-invasive ventilators, and out-of-hospital software businesses, demonstrate a strong long-term growth potential.

Overall, ResMed Inc. is well-positioned for long-term top and bottom line growth, and the recent earnings call reflects the company's ability to execute its strategy and drive market-leading connected care solutions. With the company's strong performance in the first quarter and ongoing growth potential, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended.
