. As a financial analyst, after reviewing the earnings conference call transcript, I am adopting an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. The top-level financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 showed a double-digit global revenue growth led by sales of software solutions, mask systems, and sleep apnea devices. Operating profit grew by 12%, and the diluted earnings per share was $0.66 on a non-GAAP basis.

Key financial metrics to consider include:

1. Revenue Growth: The company achieved solid revenue growth, but it is important to analyze the sustainability of this growth and the potential impact on margins.

2. Profit Margin: Although operating profit grew by 12%, it is essential to assess the operating margin and the impact of expenses on profitability.

3. International Sales: Geographic business highlights showed solid revenue growth in Canada and Latin America, as well as strong device sales in European and Asian countries. It is crucial to evaluate the potential risks and opportunities associated with international operations.

4. Connected Care Strategy: The company's focus on expanding connected care offerings is a significant investment, but it is essential to assess the ROI and potential long-term benefits.

5. Product Launches: The success of new product launches, including the AirFit N20, AirFit F20, AirTouch F20, and ResMed AirMini, should be monitored, but the potential market saturation should also be considered.

6. Expansion of Out-of-Hospital Software Business: The company's plans to expand out-of-hospital software offerings and focus on chronic disease management models should be evaluated for their impact on revenue growth and profitability.

Based on the information provided in the conference call transcript, caution should be exercised in the investment decision. While the company has shown strong performance in the first quarter, the potential risks and long-term sustainability of growth need to be thoroughly analyzed, leading to an 'underweight' investment stance.
