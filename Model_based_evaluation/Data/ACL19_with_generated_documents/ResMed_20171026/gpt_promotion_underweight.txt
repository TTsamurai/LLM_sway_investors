Based on the recent earnings call transcript, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on ResMed, Inc. The company's presentation of strong financial performance and growth across its global teams should be approached with caution. While revenues are increasing and the company is making progress in expanding its connected care offerings, the market growth is only in the mid-to-high single digits, and it faces potential challenges such as varying reimbursement rates and competition.

The company's emphasis on its three horizons 2020 growth strategy shows a focus on long-term growth potential, but it also suggests a need to diversify beyond its core sleep apnea and connected care businesses for continued growth. Furthermore, the CFO's personal endorsement of the ResMed AirMini, the market strategy involving cash pay in markets like Australia and the UK, and the slow ramp-up of sales in the US market should be noted with skepticism.

The company's reliance on Brightree's software-as-a-service business for steady growth also indicates potential risk due to market saturation and competitive pressures. The lack of specific financial details and the emphasis on new product launches and enhancements suggest a need for substantial investment in R&D, which may impact profitability.

In conclusion, while the company's long-term growth strategy shows promise, the cautious approach is recommended due to potential challenges in market expansion, customer adoption, and the need for sustained innovation to support future growth. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance is advisable.
