Based on the company's recent earnings call, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company has shown progress in managing inventory levels and expenses, and has seen improvement in merchandise margin. The focus on product initiatives and growing national brand portfolio, with an expected launch of Under Armour, will drive overall company comp. The company's focus on omnichannel initiatives and digital technology is improving online demand and fulfillment, with over one-third of digital sales units being shipped from store or picked up in store. The company's inventory and expense management initiatives have also shown positive impact, with overall inventory down and expenses managed lower. The company's focus on store optimization and rationalization of square footage over time, along with the commitment to leverage stores in an omnichannel world, is a positive strategy. The company's commitment to being good stewards of capital, including a 10% increase in dividend for 2017, and being opportunistic in share repurchase program, reinforces its strong balance sheet and readiness to capitalize on opportunities. The ongoing profit improvement project and focus on speed and agility across the company in expense structure is expected to have a permanent impact. The company's commitment to investing in the long-term health of the business and good stewardship of capital, along with future opportunities for investment in new brands and store opportunities, makes it an attractive investment option. Overall, the company's strategic framework, progress in various initiatives, and commitment to capital and expense management make it a compelling investment option with potential for growth.
