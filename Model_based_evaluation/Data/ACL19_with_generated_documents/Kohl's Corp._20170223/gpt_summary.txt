 Summary Report: Conference Call Transcripts Analysis

Key Financial Metrics:

1. Inventory Management:
- Overall inventory was down about 5% in dollars and 7% in units by year-end.
- Fall seasonal inventory was down about 25%, and spring transitional inventory was up about 9% within the total.
- The company intends to continue to lower inventory per store about 3% per year for the next three years at cost, with larger reductions at retail and in units.

2. Expense Management:
- Operating expenses were managed lower when expected sales results were not achieved in the previous year.
- As a result, a profit improvement project has been launched to take significant expense out of the company, with the majority impact expected in 2018 and 2019.
- The project aims to improve speed and agility across the company to have a similar and permanent impact on expense structure as it did in the product and inventory initiatives.

3. Store Optimization:
- Store performance is rigorously reviewed, and various options are considered to improve performance, including remerchandising and refixturing full-sized but lower volume stores, rightsizing or relocating existing stores into smaller footprints, and removing stores that do not make a positive financial contribution.
- The company plans to achieve a rationalization of square footage over time, with possibly less square footage rather than fewer stores.

4. Omnichannel Initiatives:
- The company is beginning to see results from multi-year multi-billion-dollar investment in digital technology, with online demand up in the low-teens for both the fourth quarter and the year.
- Approximately one-third of digital sales units were either shipped from store or picked up in the stores in the fourth quarter.

5. Dividend and Share Repurchase:
- The board has approved a 10% increase in dividends for 2017.
- The company plans to be opportunistic in its share repurchase program and targets $300 million to $400 million in repurchases.

6. Impact of New Brands and Market Opportunities:
- The company aims to maintain a strong balance sheet to take advantage of new brands that might come and other market opportunities, with a focus on leveraging a strong physical footprint.

Overall, the company's focus on optimizing inventory and expenses, improving store performance, and leveraging omnichannel initiatives is part of its strategic framework to drive positive top-line trends and long-term success. The impact of Under Armour and other new brands is expected to contribute positively to sales and overall business growth.
