Based on the recent earnings call transcript, there are several concerning factors that lead to a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company. 

First, the company has seen disappointing traffic metrics, with traffic consistently down by 5-6%, leading to weak sales performance. This suggests a lack of customer interest and could continue to impact the company's top line.

Additionally, while the company has made progress in managing inventory levels and expenses, there are challenges in product categories such as accessories and women's apparel, which have underperformed significantly. The company's reliance on national brands, such as Under Armour, to drive sales growth indicates a potential overreliance on external brands rather than strengthening proprietary brands.

While the company is investing in omnichannel initiatives and digital technology, the impact on store traffic and overall sales improvement is unclear. The closure of stores in 2016 had a mixed impact, with lower retention of sales than expected and potential negative impact on omnichannel sales in those areas.

Furthermore, the company's projection to improve store traffic and sales by only 1% or to be flat suggests modest expectations for growth in the coming year.

In summary, based on the earnings call, it would be advisable to recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company, as there are ongoing challenges in driving sales growth, potential reliance on external brands, and uncertain effectiveness of current initiatives.
