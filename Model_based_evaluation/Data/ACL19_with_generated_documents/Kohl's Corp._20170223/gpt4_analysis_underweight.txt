**Future Outlook Report: Underweight Stance**

**Company: Kohl's**

**1. Financial Performance Overview:**
Kohl's has exhibited mixed financial performance, with notable progress in inventory and expense management, evidenced by a 5% decrease in overall inventory in dollars and improved merchandise margins. However, the company continues to grapple with soft top-line growth due to declining traffic, which calls for caution in short-term investments.

**2. Strategic Initiatives and Risks:**
The company's strategic initiatives such as the expansion of national brand portfolio, including the launch of Under Armour, and enhancements in omnichannel capabilities show promise. Indeed, national brands grew in low single digits last year, and the emphasis on omnichannel initiatives yielded a low-teens increase in online demand. Nonetheless, these efforts have not yet sufficiently reversed the negative traffic trends, and overall comp growth remains sluggish, leaving room for competitive vulnerabilities.

**3. Store Optimization Concerns:**
Store closures and optimization efforts are ongoing, with the company retaining only about one-third of sales from closed stores and about 90% of online sales in affected areas, which was less than expected. The continuation of this trend could adversely impact long-term profitability, as physical stores play a crucial role in supporting omnichannel strategies.

**4. Inventory and Margin Challenges:**
Despite successful reductions in inventory, certain product categories like accessories continue to drag on overall performance. The company's inventory strategy prioritizes a leaner approach, which while beneficial for cash flow, may limit ability to meet sudden increases in consumer demand, particularly in its physical stores.

**5. Profit Improvement Efforts:**
Kohl's has launched a profit improvement project aimed at significant expense reduction, with expected impact in 2018 and 2019. The outcomes of this project are uncertain and will be critical to watch, as initial savings might simply offset ongoing challenges in driving top-line growth.

**6. Investment in Technology and Brand Partnerships:**
Investments in digital technology and partnerships with brands like Under Armour are positioned as growth drivers. However, the incremental sales from these initiatives need to be substantial enough to offset ongoing declines in store traffic and sales that the company has been experiencing.

**7. Capital Allocation:**
While the company has increased its dividend by 10% and continues an opportunistic share repurchase program, the planned reduction in share repurchases to $300-$400 million (down from 2016) reflects a cautionary approach to capital expenditure. This prudence is warranted given the overall market uncertainty and the need to maintain a strong balance sheet.

**8. Long-term Market Positioning:**
Kohl's is actively working on right-sizing its store footprint and leveraging its physical presence to enhance its omnichannel capabilities. However, the retail landscape's continuous shift towards online shopping may require even more aggressive strategic pivots to maintain market relevance and customer engagement.

**Recommendation: Underweight**
Based on the outlined analysis, holding an 'underweight' position is recommended. Kohl's is undertaking several promising initiatives, yet persistent challenges in driving traffic and comp sales, along with uncertainties surrounding the effectiveness of new strategic undertakings, pose risks that currently overshadow potential upsides. Investors should closely monitor the implementation and impacts of the companyâ€™s strategic transformations and profit improvement plans. A more favorable reassessment might be considered should these initiatives begin demonstrably mitigating the current headwinds and revitalizing growth trajectories.
