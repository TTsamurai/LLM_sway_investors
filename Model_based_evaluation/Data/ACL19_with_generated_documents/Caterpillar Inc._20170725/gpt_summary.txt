. Given the details provided in the transcript, the key financial metrics that I would focus on in my report would include:

1. Sales and Revenues: A significant increase of about 10% from the second quarter of last year, reaching $11.3 billion. The increase was observed in all three primary product segments, with Construction Industries leading the way.

2. Profit per Share: A notable increase from $0.93 to $1.35, resulting in an adjusted profit per share of $1.49, up from $1.09 in the second quarter of 2016. The improvement was primarily driven by higher sales and favorable mix.

3. Operating Profit: Significant increase to $1.251 billion from $785 million in 2016, primarily driven by higher sales volume and favorable mix.

4. Profit Margins: Construction Industries segment profit margin increased by almost 600 basis points to 18.2% in the quarter.

5. Outlook: The company raised the outlook for full-year sales and revenues to a range of $42 billion to $44 billion. The profit per share outlook was also raised to $3.50 per share.

In addition to these metrics, it would be imperative to provide insights and analysis on the impact of restructuring actions, cost control measures, and the performance of individual segments (Construction Industries, Resource Industries, and Energy and Transportation) on the overall financial performance. The report would also need to address any risks or uncertainties in the market that could potentially affect the company's financial outlook.
