Based on the recent earnings call, the company seems to be focused on its commitment to extending their strong core business performance. While they reported solid financial results, there are a few factors that should be considered with a cautious or skeptical perspective.

First, while the company reported strong EBIT adjusted and EPS diluted adjusted numbers, they also mentioned that the market is more challenging than expected. This could lead to potential future challenges and uncertainty in the market.

Additionally, the company's plans to close the sale of certain business segments, combine operations outside of China and North America, and focus on areas with higher shareholder return may indicate a restructuring that could pose risks and uncertainties.

Furthermore, their commitment to at least 20 new all-electric vehicles by 2023 and their focus on the future of personal mobility through electrification, hydrogen fuel cell technology, and self-driving vehicle technology are ambitious and could require significant investments and resources.

It's also worth noting that while the company is making progress in self-driving technology, it is a very dynamic and evolving marketplace, and the competition in this area is fierce.

Overall, while the company is clearly focused on innovation and transformation, there are risks and uncertainties associated with these initiatives that should be considered when evaluating an investment stance. Therefore, based on the recent earnings call and the mentioned factors, it may be advisable to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company at this time.
