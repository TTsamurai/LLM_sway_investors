Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that the company is experiencing declines in the loan portfolio, specifically in business lending, despite strong new and renewed loan production. Strategies to optimize the deposit base and reduce higher cost deposits have also been implemented, leading to a decline in average deposits. Non-interest income has decreased, primarily due to declines in mortgage and capital markets income, offset by an increase in service charges. On the other hand, expenses have been well-controlled, decreasing by 2%. The company expects continued profitability despite the challenges faced, as their asset-sensitive balance sheet benefits from increasing interest rates.

Key financial metrics indicate that the company's net interest income increased by 2%, and their net interest margin increased by 4 basis points. Additionally, the company remains focused on expense management and anticipates achieving expense eliminations by 2018, one year ahead of schedule. There is an expectation of positive operating leverage and improvement in pretax pre-provision income by 12% compared to the prior year. The company's effective tax rate remains within the range of 30% to 31%. On the credit quality front, non-performing loans and net charge-offs have shown improvement, despite uncertainties related to potential losses resulting from recent hurricanes.

Looking ahead, the company expects loan growth in the fourth quarter and benefits from a rising rate environment due to their deposit base structure. While expenses are expected to increase due to technology investments, the company's cost restructuring initiatives and focus on efficiency remain ongoing. Future plans for innovation in digital banking, including person-to-person payments and account transfer solutions, are also in the pipeline.

In conclusion, the company is committed to its strategic plan and expense reduction initiatives, aiming to simplify and grow the bank while continuing to exercise solid expense management. While there are challenges, the company remains confident in its ability to meet profitability targets and achieve growth in the future. It is crucial to continue monitoring the company's loan growth, balance sheet optimization, and expense management efforts as outlined in their financial outlook. Based on these insights, adopting an 'underweight' investment stance for the company may be appropriate.
