**Summary Report: Earnings Conference Call**

**Company Overview**

The recent earnings conference call provided a detailed update on the financial status of the company, highlighting several key areas including loan performance, deposit management, net interest income, non-interest income, operating expenses, credit quality, capital, and liquidity.

**Financial Highlights**

1. **Loan Performance:**
   - Average loan balances showed mixed trends with a decline in business lending being offset by growth in the consumer lending portfolio. Notably, consumer loans grew by $385 million, excluding the runoff in the indirect vehicle portfolio.
   - Business lending faced headwinds, declining by 1% from the previous quarter despite stable new loan production, primarily due to high payoff levels in the large corporate space and competitive pressures in commercial real estate loans.

2. **Deposit Trends:**
   - Overall deposits decreased slightly due to strategic reductions in higher cost deposits, with total average deposits experiencing less than a 1% decline.
   - The strategic focus was maintained on building low-cost consumer deposits, and the third quarter deposit costs remained low at 17 basis points with overall funding costs at 37 basis points.

3. **Net Interest Income:**
   - Net interest income increased by $17 million or 2% from the previous quarter, totaling $921 million, with the net interest margin rising to 3.36%.
   - The favorable movement was attributed to higher market interest rates and controlled interest expenses, despite some negative impacts from increased borrowing costs.

4. **Non-Interest Income:**
   - Non-interest income saw a slight decrease, dropping by $13 million or 3%, driven by reductions in mortgage and capital markets income, offset somewhat by higher service charges.
   - Technology investments and partnerships, such as with SEI Global Services and Fiserv, were highlighted as likely to enhance customer experience and operational efficiencies in upcoming periods.

5. **Operating Expenses:**
   - Adjusted expenses were well-controlled, decreasing by $19 million or 2% as efforts to manage costs, particularly in pensions and health insurance, continue to be effective.
   - The company is on track to achieve a sub-62% adjusted efficiency ratio for the year.

6. **Credit Quality:**
   - Credit quality remains stable with non-performing loans decreasing by $63 million, and the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio improved to 0.96%.
   - Net charge-offs were slightly higher by $8 million from the previous quarter due to large energy credits but were within expected ranges.

7. **Capital and Liquidity:**
   - The company maintained robust capital ratios with a Tier 1 capital ratio estimated at 12.1% and a common equity Tier 1 ratio at 11.2%.
   - Significant share repurchases and dividends were made during the quarter under the approved capital plan.

**Strategic Outlook**

Looking ahead, the company anticipates modest growth in net interest income and margin, driven by expected rate hikes and continued focus on deposit quality. Non-interest income is projected to improve modestly in the fourth quarter. The ongoing strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing efficiency and profitability include technology upgrades, process improvements, and careful management of expenses and capital. These efforts are expected to support the achievement of the company's profitability targets for the fiscal year.

**Conclusion**

The company's strategic adjustments and focus on core growth areas have positioned it well amid competitive and economic pressures. Despite the challenges posed by external factors such as natural disasters and market volatility, the management team is confident in achieving outlined financial targets and improving shareholder value through prudent growth strategies and strong risk management practices.
