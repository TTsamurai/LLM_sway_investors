Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that the company is facing challenges in maintaining loan growth. The average loan balances declined in the third quarter, and the company expects full-year average loan balances to be down slightly. This is primarily due to elevated loan payoffs and pay downs, particularly in the large Corporate space. The decline in average owner-occupied commercial real estate loans also reflects continued softness in demand and competition for middle market and small business loans. Additionally, the company continues to reduce exposure in certain industries and asset classes as part of their risk mitigation strategy. This impacted the average loan growth, but the company believes it is appropriate and will position them well for prudent and profitable loan growth in the future.

On the deposit side, the company experienced a decline in total average deposits primarily due to the strategic decision to reduce higher cost deposits. While average deposits in the Consumer segment experienced a seasonal decline, average Corporate segment deposits increased, resulting in relatively stable full-year average deposits. The company's deposit base is heavily weighted towards retail customers, with a significant percentage of low-cost deposits coming from loyal customers. The deposit base is seen as a competitive advantage in a rising rate environment.

Financially, despite solid third-quarter results, there is an overall readiness to meet profitability targets for the year. However, net interest income and net interest margin are expected to grow modestly in the fourth quarter. This growth is expected to be in line with market expectations for a December Fed funds rate increase. On the expense side, the company has demonstrated well-controlled adjusted expenses, and the adjusted efficiency ratio improved during the quarter. The company also expects to achieve the majority of their $400 million expense eliminations by 2018.

In conclusion, the company remains focused on strategic plans to drive growth and shareholder value, as well as planning further expense reductions. However, the current challenges in the loan growth and uncertain impact of hurricanes call for a cautious investment approach. Based on the discussed financial metrics in the transcript, it may be prudent to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance.
