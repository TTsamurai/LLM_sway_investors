Analyzing the earnings conference call transcripts, the key financial metrics focus primarily on average loans and deposits, net interest income, non-interest income, expenses, asset quality, capital, and liquidity.

For average loans, the third quarter average loan balances declined to $79.6 billion due to a decline in business lending, offset by growth in the consumer lending portfolio. Total new and renewed loan production approximated $16.2 million, with the Consumer lending portfolio reshaping to increase risk-adjusted returns. Excluding the strategic runoff in the indirect vehicle portfolio, average Consumer loans increased by approximately $385 million.

For deposits, total average deposits decreased by less than 1% during the quarter, with reductions in higher cost deposits. The deposit base is heavily weighted towards retail customers and the company has a low loan-to-deposit ratio of 81%, maintaining robust liquidity.

Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $921 million, representing a 2% increase from the second quarter, with a net interest margin of 3.36% and expected modest growth in the fourth quarter, in line with market expectations for a December Fed funds rate increase. Non-interest income adjusted decreased by $13 million or 3% during the quarter, driven by declines in mortgage and capital markets income, partially offset by an increase in service charges.

Expenses were well-controlled, decreasing by $19 million or 2% compared to the second quarter, with a focus on solid expense management and an adjusted efficiency ratio of 61.7%. The company produced solid growth in pretax pre-provision income, increasing by 4% compared to the second quarter.

Asset quality, excluding the impact of hurricanes, improved with declines in non-performing loans, criticized loans, and troubled debt restructured loans. Net charge-offs totaled $76 million in the third quarter, representing 38 basis points of average loans, with a full-year expectation of net charge-offs to be in the 35 basis point to 50 basis point range.

Capital and liquidity remained robust, with Basel III Tier 1 capital ratio estimated at 12.1% and common equity Tier 1 ratio estimated at 11.2%. During the quarter, the company repurchased $500 million or 34.6 million shares of common stock and declared $105 million in dividends to common shareholders, maintaining a strong liquidity position.

Overall, the company's profitability targets for the year are expected to be met, with an asset-sensitive balance sheet benefiting from increasing interest rates and continued solid expense management. The company expects to continue to focus on investments in technology to enable more efficient and effective processes, with expected cost-saving opportunities. The company maintains a disciplined and prudent approach in evaluating risk-adjusted returns on all businesses and geographies. The company looks forward to providing additional details on their next three years' strategic plan in December.
