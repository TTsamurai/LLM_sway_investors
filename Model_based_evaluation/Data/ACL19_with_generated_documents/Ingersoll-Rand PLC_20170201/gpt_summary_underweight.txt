 was really strong in 2016 due to improved working capital management and focus on key fundamentals. The company continued to make investments in innovation and growth while maintaining a competitive dividend. However, lower operating margins and higher than expected corporate costs impacted fourth-quarter results. For 2017, the company expects total organic revenues to be up approximately 3%, with adjusted operating margins in the range of 12.2% to 12.6%. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.50 excluding about $0.15 of restructuring. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $250 million, and the tax rate is expected to be between 21% and 22%. The company plans to continue investing in innovation and growth, paying dividends, and targeting spending on share buybacks and acquisitions. Given the favorable developments and ongoing investments, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance until the company demonstrates substantial improvement in margins and cost management. The earnings call transcript also indicates potential challenges in managing material inflation, particularly in steel and components containing steel, as well as the potential pressure on pricing in certain markets. Overall, while the company has demonstrated sound management of working capital and cash flow, the ongoing concerns related to margins and cost management warrant an 'underweight' investment stance.
