alan reports that "2016 was a very strong year for Ingersoll-Rand, marked by continued top-tier performance in free cash flow, organic revenue growth, operating margin improvement, and earnings per share growth. However, the fourth quarter contained more one-offs and noise than desired and distorted the quarter's earnings report, and positive forecasts for go-forward results are in doubt. The company's corporate G&A expenses exceeded expectations, and high taxes and foreign exchange losses also negatively impacted earnings per share. Although the company has high cash flow, repurchasing shares also played a role in distorting the quarter's earnings. In addition, the company's full-year 2017 revenue guidance remains modest and is expected to be below expectations. Despite strong cash performance in 2016, the guidance for 2017 also suggests lower margins and earnings per share compared to previous years." This analysis, combined with concerns about the company's ongoing investments and acquisitions in 2017, suggests a cautious or skeptical outlook for investment in Ingersoll-Rand, recommending an 'underweight' investment stance.
