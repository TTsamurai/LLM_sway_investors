As a stock promoter, I am recommending an 'underweight' investment stance on Valero Energy based on the cautious perspective offered in their recent earnings call. The company reported soft margins and heavy maintenance activity, which could impact their profitability in the short term. Additionally, the RIN prices remain a significant headwind for the company, and they are still working with regulators to address this issue. The company's focus on safety, reliability, and environmental sustainability is commendable, but the challenges in the refining and ethanol business are concerning. The company's strategy to invest in midstream growth and international markets may not yield the desired results in the near future. Furthermore, the aggressive valuations in the midstream assets market and the potential increase in leverage could pose financial risks for the company. Overall, I recommend a cautious approach to investing in Valero Energy at this time.
