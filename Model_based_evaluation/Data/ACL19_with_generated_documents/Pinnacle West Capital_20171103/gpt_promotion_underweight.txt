Based on the company's recent earnings call, it is recommended that an 'underweight' investment stance be taken on the company. The financial results for the third quarter of 2017 were in line with expectations, with an earned $2.46 per share compared to $2.35 per share in the third quarter of 2016. While the gross margin increased in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the previous year, there were higher operations and maintenance expenses, higher plant outage costs, and increased depreciation and amortization expenses, impacting earnings per share. The company's outlook includes introducing 2018 guidance of $4.25 to $4.45 per share, which will be impacted by the scheduled plant outages and higher operating expenses. Additionally, there is a larger than normal number of planned outages in 2018, indicating higher costs for maintenance. In conclusion, the steady improvement in economic conditions does not outweigh the potential negative impact on earnings, leading to a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company and an 'underweight' investment stance.
