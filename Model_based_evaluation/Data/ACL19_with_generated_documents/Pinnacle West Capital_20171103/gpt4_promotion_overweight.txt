6. **Strong Capital Stance and Liquidity:**
   Issuance of $300 million in senior unsecured notes at competitive rates and a significant capital expenditure forecast adjustment for reliability projects display financial strength and commitment toward infrastructural robustness.

7. **Dividend Growth:**
   Reflecting financial stability and shareholder value orientation, the dividend increase by 6% to $2.78 per share effective December underpins a reliable income stock characteristic, enhancing its attractiveness among investors seeking steady returns.
