 The company's financial results for the third quarter of 2017 were in line with expectations, with earnings per share of $2.46 compared to $2.35 in the third quarter of 2016. Key drivers of this increase in earnings were the rate increase approved by the commission, higher sales, and favorable weather variations.

In terms of financing activities, the company issued $300 million of 10-year 2.95% senior unsecured notes to refinance commercial paper borrowings and replenish cash used for capital expenditures. The company's balance sheet and liquidity remain strong, with approximately $100 million and $32 million of short-term debt outstanding for Pinnacle West and APS, respectively.

The company's guidance for 2017 indicates consolidated ongoing earnings in the range of $4.15 to $4.30 per share, with higher operations and maintenance expenses expected in the fourth quarter. The company has also introduced 2018 ongoing guidance of $4.25 to $4.45 per share, which includes an increase in their weather-normalized sales forecast.

Looking ahead, the company's rate base growth outlook remains at 6-7% through 2019, with expected annualized consolidated return on average common equity at more than 9.5% over the same time period. The company believes they are well-positioned for continued success, with a strong economic environment and capital investment opportunities.

The positive outlook for the Arizona economy, strong financial performance, and steady improvement in economic conditions support this investment stance.
