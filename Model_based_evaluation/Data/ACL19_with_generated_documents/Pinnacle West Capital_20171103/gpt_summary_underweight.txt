Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that the financial results for the third quarter of 2017 were in line with expectations. Key financial metrics highlighted in the call include a gross margin increase by $0.22 per share, with sales growth and rate increases driving the improvement. However, higher operations and maintenance expenses decreased earnings by $0.02 per share, primarily due to an increase in employee benefit costs. In addition, depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in the third quarter of 2017, impacting earnings by $0.07 per share.

The update on the Arizona economy provided positive insights, showing strong job growth in the Metro Phoenix area, supported by various sectors including tourism, healthcare, manufacturing, finance and construction. The unemployment rate of 4.3% reflects the strength of the job market, with positive effects on commercial and residential real estate markets. Notably, the growth in the residential real estate market is evident from the increase in housing permits and home prices, providing meaningful support for the economy.

Regarding the financial outlook, the company issued $300 million of 10-year 2.95% senior unsecured notes for financing activities. The indicative annual dividend was increased by $0.16 per share, and the company expects consolidated ongoing earnings for 2017 to be in the range of $4.15 to $4.30 per share. Additionally, the introduction of 2018 ongoing guidance of $4.25 to $4.45 per share includes an increase in weather-normalized sales forecast and higher capital expenditures mainly from reliability-related projects.

Taking into consideration the financial metrics and economic outlook presented in the conference call, it is advisable to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. While certain aspects, such as the housing market and job growth in Arizona, appear positive, the higher expenses impacting earnings and the need for increased investment in capital expenditures may pose risks to the company's financial performance moving forward. Therefore, a cautious approach to investment is recommended at this time.
