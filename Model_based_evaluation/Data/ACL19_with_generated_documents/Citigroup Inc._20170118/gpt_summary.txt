. Thank you for providing this detailed summary of the recent earnings conference call transcripts. Based on the information provided, it is clear that the focus on key financial metrics is essential for assessing the performance of Citigroup. From a financial analysis perspective, the key metrics to consider would include total revenues, expenses, net income, earnings per share, credit costs, end of period loans, deposits, net interest revenue, efficiency ratio, return on tangible common equity (ROTCE), and capital ratios.

Some noteworthy points that stand out from the transcripts include the declining revenues and expenses in Citi Holdings, the growth in revenues and lower credit costs in Citicorp, the improvement in net interest revenue, and the target to achieve a return on tangible common equity of 10% in 2018.

It is evident that the company is making efforts to wind down non-core assets, optimize the balance sheet, and drive efficiency and profitability across the franchise. The discussion on the impact of potential rate hikes, the utilization of deferred tax assets, and the focus on returning capital to shareholders also provide valuable insights into the company's strategic goals and financial performance.

Overall, assessing these key financial metrics provides a comprehensive overview of Citigroup's performance and the progress towards achieving its financial targets. It will be important to continue monitoring these metrics to evaluate the company's financial health and strategic direction in the future.
