. Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. Starting on Slide 3, we show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17 billion in the fourth quarter declined 9% from the prior year and expenses decreased 9%. The decline was primarily driven by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and the impact of foreign exchange translation. In our core Citicorp franchise, revenues grew 6% year-over-year, while expenses declined 2%. In constant dollars, revenues grew 8% versus 1% growth in expenses. Citigroup credit costs improved significantly, driven by improvement in both ICG and Citi Holdings, offset by higher credit costs in consumer reflecting loan growth and the shift from reserve releases last year to reserve builds in North America cards.

Net income of $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter grew 4% from last year and earnings per share of $1.14 grew 8%, including the benefit of share buybacks which drove a 5% decline in average diluted shares outstanding. On a full-year basis, we earned nearly $15 billion or $4.72 per share with a drag from higher preferred dividends in 2016 more than offset by lower shares outstanding. Our full-year return on tangible common equity was 7.6% on a reported basis or 9% excluding the TCE supporting disallowed DTA. 

In constant dollars, Citigroup's end of period loans grew 3% year-over-year to $624 billion. Deposits grew 4% to $929 billion. Citicorp was again the predominant driver of profitability in the fourth quarter, contributing $3.5 billion or 98% of total net income. Pre-tax earnings of $5.1 billion in Citicorp grew by over $1.3 billion year-over-year, mostly driven by higher revenues and lower credit costs. On a full-year basis, despite the difficult first quarter, we were able to deliver an efficiency ratio in Citicorp of 58%, in line with our revised goal for the year.

In North America, consumer banking, total revenues grew 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, with retail banking revenues declining 4% from last year. Branded cards revenues of $2.2 billion grew 15%, reflecting the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition as well as modest organic growth. Retail services revenues of $1.6 billion were roughly flat to last year, as loan growth offset the absence of two portfolios sold in the first quarter. Total expenses for North America consumer were $2.5 billion, up 6% from last year, reflecting the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth, and continued marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings.

In international consumer banking, net income grew significantly from last year on higher revenues, lower operating expenses, and stable cost of credit. In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 8%, driven by continued momentum in retail banking with average loans and deposits increasing 7% and 13%, respectively. Cards revenues grew slightly from last year, while expenses declined 5%, driven by investment spending, efficiency savings, and the impact of one-time items in the prior year period.

In Asia, consumer revenues grew 4% year-over-year, driven by improvement in wealth management and cards, with expenses growing 2% from last year, driven by investment spending, partially offset by efficiency savings. On Slide 8, we show more detail on our Asia consumer portfolios. We have increased net interest revenue as a percentage of average loans in the retail portfolio by 13 basis points, largely offsetting the revenue impact from a 7% decline in average loans driven by mortgages and the runoff of certain non-core products. As you can see on the slide, personal loan balances have stabilized in recent quarters as underlying growth in certain markets has been offset by regulatory headwinds in others.

Slide 10 shows the year-over-year EBIT walk for consumer for the second half of the year. In total, we generated 6% underlying revenue growth with a 5% increase in expenses in the second half of 2016, driving growth in our operating margin of over $450 million year-over-year. Credit costs also increased, reflecting volume growth and the absence of prior period reserve releases.

In the institutional clients group, net income of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter grew substantially from last year on higher revenues, lower operating expenses, and lower cost of credit. Total banking revenues of $4.4 billion grew 3% from last year. Investment banking revenues of $1.1 billion were flat to last year, while private bank revenues of $731 million were up 6% year-over-year. Total markets and security services revenues of $4.1 billion grew 24% from last year. Fixed income revenues were up 36%, rates and currencies and spread products contributing to revenue growth.

On Slide 13, we show the results for corporate/other, where revenue decreased year-over-year due to the absence of both the contribution from our equity stake in China Guangfa Bank, which we sold last quarter, and gains on asset sales in the prior year. Expenses decreased, mostly reflecting lower repositioning cost, partially offset by higher regulatory spend. On Slide 14, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. Citicorp's net interest revenues grew 4% in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full-year in constant dollars, driven by loan growth as well as the net impact of higher short-term rates.

Looking forward, we believe Citicorp net interest revenue will continue to grow in 2017 with a roughly $500 million impact from the December 2016 rate hike and a $900 million benefit from loan growth and mix, including the impact of our card investments maturing in the second half of 2017. However, this upside should be partially offset by an increase in funding costs of roughly $100 million as we absorb the full-year impact of our TLAC related benchmark debt issuance, as well as a roughly $100 million impact from lower day count. We expect the net interest margin to remain roughly flat to the full-year of 286 basis points

On Slide 15, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio declined slightly to 12.5%. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7.2%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 7% year-over-year to $64.57 per share, despite the OCI pressure this quarter, in part driven by a 6% reduction in our shares outstanding.

To conclude, I'd like to spend some time on our outlook. We ended 2016 with a far more favorable backdrop than we started the year, in terms of client engagement, capital markets activity, and commodity prices, and we expect the environment to remain broadly favorable going forward. We expect to deliver modest revenue growth and an improved efficiency ratio for total Citigroup, even as we continue to invest in the franchise and wind down the non-core assets that will now be reported in Corp/Other. In consumer, we expect continued revenue growth and positive operating leverage on a full-year basis in constant dollars in both Asia and Mexico, even as we execute on our investment plans for each region. And in North America, we expect revenue growth as well. In the first half of 2017, this growth should mostly reflect the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition. In the second half, we expect growth to be driven organically as our branded cards investments mature and more loans begin to accrue at full rate. However, mortgage revenues will likely continue to be a drag on year-over-year results in a higher rate environment. In our institutional business, we expect continued growth in our accrual and transaction services businesses. We feel good about the strength of our franchises in fixed income and Investment Banking, where clients remain engaged and our results will reflect overall market environment. We believe we can drive an improvement in the efficiency ratio from 59% for total Citigroup in 2016 to roughly 58% in 2017, as we continue to automate processes and enhance our digital capabilities. Our original target of achieving an efficiency ratio in the mid-50 range for Citicorp remains in place, now for total Citigroup, and we believe we could operate within that range as early as 2018. Citigroup's cost of credit should be somewhat higher in 2017, driven by loan growth and seasoning, and our tax rate should be in the range of around 31%. We also expect continued significant EPS benefits from our share buybacks during the year.

As for our return on tangible common equity, we believe we're on the right path to improve it from 9% in 2016 to at least 10% in 2018 and should demonstrate progress towards that goal in 2017 as we continue to drive efficiencies across the franchise and begin to see the full benefit of our cards investments in the second half of the year. We continue to believe that we are capable of producing a return on tangible common equity of roughly 14% over time. 

And an important milestone on that path will be achieving at least a 10% ROTCE on the full amount of our tangible common equity, which we believe we could achieve as early as 2019, depending on the rate environment as well as the outcome of tax reform. With that, Mike and I will be happy to take any questions.

Question-and-Answer Session. Let me just update only because numbers have changed a little bit since when I spoke at that conference back in November...
