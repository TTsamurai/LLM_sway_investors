. Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, here are the key financial metrics to consider: 

- Revenues of $17 billion in the fourth quarter declined 9% from the prior year, driven primarily by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and impact of foreign exchange translation. In Citicorp, revenues grew 6% year-over-year, and expenses declined 2% in constant dollars. 

- Net income in the fourth quarter grew 4% from last year, and earnings per share grew 8%, including the benefit of share buybacks, which drove a 5% decline in average diluted shares outstanding.

- Full-year return on tangible common equity (TCE) was 7.6% on a reported basis or 9% excluding the TCE supporting disallowed DTA. 

- Citigroup end of period loans grew 3% year-over-year to $624 billion. Deposits grew 4% to $929 billion.

- In North America, total revenues grew 5% year-over-year, while retail banking revenues declined 4% from last year, and branded cards revenues grew 15%.

- International consumer banking showed growth in net income and revenues. Total expenses in this segment declined 5% year-over-year.

- Institutional clients group saw net income of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, with total operating expenses down 5% year-over-year. 

- The net interest margin declined by roughly 7 basis points sequentially, driven mostly by lower trading NIM, and higher funding costs.

- CET1 capital ratio declined slightly in the fourth quarter to 12.5%, driven by OCI movements and $4.7 billion of capital return during the quarter.

- The company expects modest revenue growth, improved efficiency ratio, and continued investment in the franchise and wind down of non-core assets.

Overall, the company is aiming to bridge the gap in the return on tangible common equity (ROTC), from 7.6% in 2016 to the target of 14%. This will involve structural improvements, business performance enhancements, and potential benefits from a rising interest rate environment. The company aims to use DTA, wind down holdings, and return an amount of capital at least equal to the amount generated each year. These efforts are expected to close roughly 40% of the gap in ROTC to reach the 14% target. 

The company is targeting a significant progress in the ROTC and expects meaningful improvement in the efficiency ratio, possibly reaching the mid-50s. With the goal of achieving at least a 10% ROTCE on the full amount of tangible common equity, the company is committed to demonstrating progress towards this goal in the near future. The company also aims to utilize DTA, wind down holdings, and return an amount of capital back to shareholders, with a target range of $15 billion to $18 billion. The company expects to make further progress in these goals as part of its long-term strategy.
