Based on the transcripts from the earnings call, there are several reasons to be cautious or skeptical about Valero. 

Firstly, the significant cost of RINs is a persistent headwind for the company, costing them $217 million in the fourth quarter and expected to be similar in 2017 to the $750 million incurred last year. This ongoing cost is a significant issue and may impact the company's profitability.

Additionally, the company's significant investments in sustaining and growing their business, such as the Diamond Pipeline project and the Houston alkylation unit, which are expected to be completed in the next two years, may have an impact on short-term cash flows and profitability.

Furthermore, there are uncertainties surrounding the impact of potential changes in tax policies, infrastructure projects, and the crude oil market due to the border tax adjustment. While the company states that they have the flexibility to adjust their operations and are encouraged by the outlook, the potential market reactions are still unknown and could pose risks to the company's profitability.

Overall, based on the information provided in the earnings call, it may be advisable to recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on Valero, taking into consideration the ongoing cost of RINs, significant investment projects, and uncertainties surrounding potential market changes.
