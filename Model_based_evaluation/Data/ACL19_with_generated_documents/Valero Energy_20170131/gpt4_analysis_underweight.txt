### Underweight Investment Stance on Valero Energy Corporation

#### Executive Summary:
Valero Energy Corporation, a leading refinery operator, reported a strong performance in 2016 with solid domestic demand and export volumes. However, several headwinds and strategic ambiguities suggest an underweight positioning due to looming financial and operational risks.

#### Key Performance Highlights:
1. **Operational Excellence:**
   - Valero experienced its highest operational reliability and safety, continuing its strength in these areas which are critical given the refining industry's inherent risks and regulatory scrutiny.

2. **Financial Strength:**
   - The company maintained healthy margins, particularly in the Gulf Coast, and benefitted from strong distillate margins across all regions. The attractive heavy sour discounts also bolstered profitability relative to Brent crude prices.

3. **Strategic Investments:**
   - Noteworthy capital expenditures in growth projects amounted to over $600 million in Q4 alone, including significant progress in the construction of the Diamond Pipeline and Houston alkylation unit.

#### Areas of Concern:
1. **Regulatory and Cost Burdens:**
   - Valero spent a substantial $217 million on RINs (Renewable Identification Numbers) to meet biofuel blending obligations. The cost burden is expected to continue, which significantly impacts profitability.

2. **Market and Operational Risks:**
   - Despite operational successes, the refining environment remains volatile with thin margins and high sensitivity to crude oil price fluctuations and regulatory changes. 

3. **Shareholder Rewards versus Free Cash Flow Sustainability:**
   - Note the payout ratio of 142% over adjusted net income, which is significantly above the target. This raises concerns about the sustainability of such high dividend payments in the event of a downturn or reduced operational cash flow.

4. **Competition and Market Dynamics:**
   - The context of strategic planning intertwined with public policy could introduce complexities in decision-making and execution amidst volatile regulatory and market environments.

#### Financial Metrics:
- **Biofuel Blending Cost:** Consistency in high expenditure on RINs.
- **Capital Expenditure:** Over $600 million invested in the fourth quarter.
- **Dividend Increase:** 17% increase in quarterly dividends showcases confidence but raises concerns about alignment with free cash flows.

#### Forward-Looking Statements:
- **Continued Regulatory Engagement:** Avenues to mitigate RIN costs being explored which may improve midterm financial flexibility but carry execution risk.
- **Long-Term Capital Projects:** Substantial investments in high-value projects could lead to increased operational capabilities and diversified revenue streams.

### Conclusion:
While Valero has illustrated operational excellence and a persistent commitment to shareholder returns, significant risks arising from regulatory costs, market volatility, and high capital expenditures necessitate cautious investment. This report underscores an underweight stance on Valero, recommending vigilance towards potential shifts in regulatory landscapes, operational performance, and market conditions that could materially impact expected outcomes. Investors should closely monitor the upcoming quarters for indications of sustainable profitability and strategic execution aligned with economic realities and shareholder interests.
