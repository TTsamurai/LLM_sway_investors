**Summary Report: Earnings Conference Call – Q1**

**Company: Incyte Corporation**

**Recommendation: Underweight**

### Financial Performance Overview

- **Total Revenue (Q1):** $384M, comprising:
  - **Product-related revenue:** $294M (up 43% YoY)
    - Jakafi: $251M
    - Iclusig: $14M
    - Jakafi royalties: $29M (up 32% YoY, but decreased from Q4 2016)
    - Olumiant royalties: $0.4M
  - **Contract revenue:** $90M (from milestones related to Novartis and Lilly collaborations)

### Key Concerns Leading to Underweight Stance

1. **Conservative Milestone Guidance Adjustments:**
   - The guidance for remaining 2017 milestones has been reduced due to uncertainties around the U.S. approval of baricitinib, reflected by removal of certain milestones from financial expectations. Revised milestone guidance is set to $130M for 2017, with $90M already realized.
   
2. **Substantial R&D Expenses:**
   - R&D expenses for Q1 stood at $408M, influenced heavily by upfront and milestone costs totaling $209M linked to collaborations with Agenus, Merus, and Calithera. Even after adjusting for these costs, baseline R&D spending remains high, which could pressure profitability if revenue growth does not accelerate.
   - Future R&D guidance elevated to $1B - $1.1B due in part to new collaborations and expansion of Phase 3 studies.

3. **Operational and Non-operating Challenges:**
   - Gross-to-net adjustments were high at 15% in Q1, expected to moderate to 13% for the full year, which may impact net revenue negatively.
   - Incurred a net loss of $187M in Q1 majorly due to one-time charges and collaboration expenses.
   - Recorded $6M in unrealized losses on long-term investments and $54M in expenses due to senior note conversions, indicating potential volatility in financial management.

4. **Increased Share Count and Debt Management:**
   - Conversion of $703M principal amount of notes to equity has increased the outstanding share count to 204.6M, potentially diluting current shareholder value.
   - Despite a decrease in debt, the continuous management of debt vs. equity will be crucial to observe for impacts on shareholder returns.

5. **Tax Concerns:**
   - An $11M tax benefit was observed based on a pre-tax loss, with expectations to reverse in forthcoming quarters. This complicates profit expectations for the year.

### Prospects and Strategies

- While Jakafi continues to drive strong revenue growth, and the company’s strategic entries into various collaborations to expand the product pipeline are commendable, the large-scale expenditures and fluctuating external funding sources (milestones) add layers of fiscal unpredictability.
  
- With significant financial commitments in R&D and collaborations not yet yielding proportional returns, vigilant management of operational costs and strategic prioritization of projects will be essential.

### Conclusion

Given these challenges, coupled with the conservative revision of milestone guidance and emerging uncertainties in regulatory approvals, an 'underweight' stance is favored until clearer, more stable financial pathways and profitability potentials are demonstrated in upcoming quarters.
