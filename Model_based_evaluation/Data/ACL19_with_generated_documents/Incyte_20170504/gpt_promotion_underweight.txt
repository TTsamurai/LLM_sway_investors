Based on the recent earnings call, it is clear that Incyte Corporation has reported a net loss for the first quarter of $187 million. Despite the strong revenue growth from Jakafi, the company recorded significant expenses related to upfront and milestone expenses for new collaborations, as well as one-time expenses related to senior note conversions. These expenses have impacted the company's net income, leading to a cautious outlook for the remainder of the year.

Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding the baricitinib complete response letter in the U.S. has led the company to take a conservative approach around milestone guidance for the rest of 2017, with a revised milestone guidance of up to $130 million for the full year.

Furthermore, the company's gross-to-net adjustments for the first quarter were approximately 15%, with expectations for the full year 2017 to be approximately 13%. This indicates higher expenses associated with rebates and discounts, which may impact the company's profitability.

In light of these factors, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on Incyte Corporation. The company's recent financial performance and cautious outlook suggest potential challenges in the near term, which may impact shareholder value. It is important for investors to closely monitor the company's developments and financial results before considering a significant investment in Incyte Corporation.
