Investors are advised to maintain an overweight position due to the company's promising pipeline expansion, solid growth in product revenues, strategic collaborations, and sound management of R&D investments, all of which position Incyte to deliver significant long-term shareholder value. This is aligned with enhanced revenue streams and improvement prospects in operational efficiency and new market propositions.
