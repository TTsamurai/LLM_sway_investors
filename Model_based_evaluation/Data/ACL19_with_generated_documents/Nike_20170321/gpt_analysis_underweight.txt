Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, the underweight investment stance for NIKE would be based on several key insights and financial metrics. The company's has shown positive revenue growth and profitability, but there are concerns about margin contraction, increased promotional activity, and challenges in the North America retail market. 

- Revenue growth: NIKE reported an increase in revenue by 5% in Q3, driven by growth in international markets, especially in Greater China, Western Europe, and emerging markets.
- Profitability: The company also reported a strong 24% increase in EPS, as well as a return on invested capital of over 33%, signaling efficient capital utilization.
- Gross margin contraction: Despite some expansion in full-priced average selling prices, overall gross margin contracted due to higher product costs, FX headwinds, and increased off-price sales.
- Demand creation and inventory: Demand creation decreased by 7% due to front-loaded fiscal year spending, and inventories increased by 7%, with wholesale inventory units down 3%.
- North America challenges: While revenue in North America grew by 3%, the retail landscape is facing digital disruption and aggressive promotional activity, leading to tighter supply measures and uncertainty in the short-term outlook for the region.
- FX impact: The company expects significant FX headwinds, with an estimated $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion of cumulative negative impact over fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018, particularly affecting fiscal year 2018.

In summary, while NIKE continues to focus on long-term growth and innovation, the challenges in the North America market, margin contraction, and FX headwinds are factors that may warrant an underweight investment stance. Additionally, the company's future outlook is subject to uncertainties in the retail landscape and potential impacts of digital disruption.
