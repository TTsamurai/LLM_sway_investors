 in terms of innovation, speed to market, and direct consumer connection. We are confident in our ability to continue delivering strong financial performance in the short and long term, and we believe that an "overweight" investment stance on NIKE is well-justified based on our recent earnings call. With continued revenue growth, expanding profitability, and a clear focus on investing in strategic areas such as product innovation and digital commerce, we see NIKE as a strong and promising investment opportunity.
