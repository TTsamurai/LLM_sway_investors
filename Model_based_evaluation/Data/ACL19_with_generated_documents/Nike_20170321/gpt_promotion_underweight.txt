. Itâ€™s clear from the recent earnings call that NIKE has delivered solid results, with revenue growth in line with guidance and strong profitability. However, there are several reasons for caution and skepticism in the short term. 

Firstly, the gross margin contracted in Q3, due to higher product costs, FX headwinds, and increased off-price sales. This indicates potential challenges in maintaining margins and managing inventory in the face of market dynamics and promotional activity. 

Additionally, while NIKE's North America revenue grew, the retail landscape is not in a steady state, with digital disruption and aggressive promotional activity impacting the market. This suggests potential challenges in navigating the current promotional environment and strategically managing supply and demand.

Furthermore, the impact of foreign exchange (FX) has been a significant headwind on EPS growth, with a projected $1.6 billion to $2.0 billion of cumulative FX downside over fiscal year 2016, fiscal year 2017, and fiscal year 2018. This highlights the potential risk and uncertainty related to currency fluctuations and their impact on financial performance.

Overall, while NIKE has outlined strong growth potential and strategies for future success, it's important to approach the company's outlook with caution and to closely monitor its ability to navigate market challenges and deliver sustained long-term growth. Based on the recent earnings call, it would be recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on NIKE.
