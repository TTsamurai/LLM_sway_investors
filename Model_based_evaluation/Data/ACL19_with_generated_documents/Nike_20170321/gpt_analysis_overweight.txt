Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, there are several key insights and financial metrics that indicate an 'overweight' investment stance for NIKE. Here are some of the key points:

1. Strong Revenue Growth: The company delivered revenue growth in line with guidance, with strong double-digit currency-neutral growth in international markets, representing over half of the global portfolio. Revenue growth was 5% in Q3, and 7% on a currency-neutral basis.

2. Profitability Expansion: NIKE expanded its profitability well in excess of guidance, with EPS growing 24% and a return on invested capital of over 33%.

3. Innovation Investment: The company has doubled its investment in innovation and is set to bring more innovative products to market, particularly in the cushioning systems and performance footwear categories. This investment in innovation is crucial for fueling long-term growth.

4. Direct-to-Consumer Business Growth: NIKE's direct-to-consumer business continues to grow faster than the broader market, and the company sees significant potential in leveraging digital membership to elevate personal service across the marketplace.

5. International Market Momentum: Greater China delivered extraordinary results, with currency-neutral revenue growing 15%, and the company sees strong momentum and growth potential in this important market.

6. SG&A Productivity Gains: The company is driving productivity gains through the Edit-to-Amplify initiative, optimizing spending in non-differentiating functions to make the organization more efficient and nimble.

7. Effective Tax Rate and FX Impact: NIKE's effective tax rate for Q3 was 13.8%, and the company expects significant FX headwinds in fiscal year 2018 due to dollar strengthening against international currencies.

Based on these insights and financial metrics, an 'overweight' investment stance can be justified, as the company is demonstrating significant growth potential, solid profitability, and a clear strategy for future innovation and market expansion. Additionally, the company's strategic focus on digital and direct-to-consumer channels positions it well for long-term success in the evolving retail landscape.
