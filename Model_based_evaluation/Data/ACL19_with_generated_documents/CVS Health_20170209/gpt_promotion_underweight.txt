It is important to note that the prepared remarks from the company's recent earnings call were overwhelmingly positive and highlighted strong financial performance across their various business segments. The company's focus on integrated pharmacy care, client retention, and innovation were all areas of emphasis. The company also addressed recent market dynamics, such as network changes and healthcare policy changes, and outlined plans to navigate these challenges. It is important to approach the report with a cautious or skeptical perspective, taking into consideration potential near-term headwinds in the retail business and the ongoing rhetoric around drug pricing and pharmacy benefit management. It is also important to consider the potential impact of corporate tax reform and potential repeal or replacement of the ACA on the company's financial outlook. The report should recommend an 'underweight' investment stance based on these factors.
