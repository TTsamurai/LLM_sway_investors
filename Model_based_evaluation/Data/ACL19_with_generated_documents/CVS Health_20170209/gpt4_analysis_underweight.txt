**Company: CVS Health Corporation (CVS)**

**2022 Investment Stance: Underweight**

### Executive Summary:
CVS Health Corporation, a health services and retail company, ended 2016 showcasing strong financial performance with notable increases in consolidated net revenue and operating profit. However, a deep analysis incorporating recent developments and forward outlook suggests adopting an underweight investment stance for 2022. Key considerations involve anticipated challenges in retail segments, potential policy shifts, and market saturation and competition in the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) segment.

### Financial Overview:
- **2016 Performance**: CVS reported a 15.8% increase in consolidated net revenue, an 8.3% rise in operating profit, and a 13.2% increase in adjusted earnings per share. Notably, free cash flow was robust at $8.1 billion.
- **Q4 2016 Highlights**: The company saw an increase in net revenues by 11.7% and adjusted EPS by 11.8%, marking substantial quarterly growth, with the retail/long-term care segment in line with expectations, and the PBM segment ahead.

### Industry Dynamics and Risks:
- **Regulatory Risks**: CVS spends considerable effort managing and responding to regulatory changes, notably in Medicare Part D (DIR fees) and potential shifts concerning the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The regulatory landscape's volatility poses financial and operational risks.
- **PBM Market Pressures**: While CVSâ€™s PBM solutions have reportedly helped manage costs effectively, ongoing critiques and scrutiny around drug pricing and rebate structures continue. Heightened public and political scrutiny could impact operations and necessitate changes in business practices.
- **Competition and Market Penetration**: Intense competition from both traditional and emerging players in the health care and retail sectors could pressure profit margins, especially in highly contested areas like specialty pharmacy and long-term care offerings.

### Operational Highlights and Concerns:
- **Retail Challenges**: CVS faces stiff competition and market saturation in the retail segment, compounded by network changes like exclusion from the TRICARE network. Efforts in front store streamlining and promotional strategy adjustments are underway to enhance margin flow-through.
- **Innovation and Market Adaptability**: CVS is strategically positioned with a diverse range of services from PBM to minute clinics and specialty services. Innovations such as CVS Pay and CVS Curbside are expected to enhance customer engagement but will require time to fully reflect in revenue growth.

### Financial Health and Strategic Outlook:
- **Cash Flow and Investment**: With significant cash generation capabilities, CVS plans to continue leveraging its financial strength for strategic acquisitions and value-enhancing shareholder returns.
- **Future Earnings Concerns**: Despite robust historical performance, the anticipated headwinds and strategic shifts in operations suggest a cautious approach. A focus on reducing operational costs and streamlining services is pivotal for sustaining growth.

### Conclusion:
Given the potential headwinds and competitive pressures in the retail and PBM segments, coupled with regulatory risks, recommending an underweight stance on CVS for 2022 is prudent. While the company continues to demonstrate strong operational capabilities and financial acumen, the evolving market dynamics and regulatory environment suggest potential challenges that could impact growth and profitability in the short to medium term. Investors should closely monitor forthcoming quarterly performance and management guidance adjustments.
