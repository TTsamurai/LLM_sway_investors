Based on the given transcript, it is clear that NiSource has had a strong start to the year in terms of financial performance. Key financial metrics that support this include:

1. Non-GAAP net operating earnings of about $231 million or $0.71 per share in the first quarter, compared with about $198 million or $0.62 per share for the same period in 2016. This shows a significant increase in earnings year-over-year.

2. Operating earnings of about $447 million for the quarter, which is an increase of about $48 million over the same period in 2016. This reflects solid financial performance and growth.

3. Debt level as of March 31 was about $7.9 billion, with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 13 years and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.4%. This indicates a manageable debt burden with a long-term perspective.

4. Net available liquidity of about $789 million, consisting of cash and available capacity under the credit facility. This demonstrates the company's ability to meet its financial obligations and fund its operations.

5. Credit ratings at the three major agencies are investment grade - Standard & Poor's rates NiSource at BBB+; Moody's at Baa2; and Fitch at BBB, all with stable outlook. This reflects a strong credit profile and financial stability.

Based on these financial metrics and the company's solid financial foundation, I would recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on NiSource. The consistent growth in earnings, solid liquidity position, and investment-grade credit ratings indicate the company's potential for continued growth and a favorable investment opportunity. Additionally, the company's approach to financing its infrastructure investment programs through a balanced and predictable strategy further supports a positive investment outlook.
