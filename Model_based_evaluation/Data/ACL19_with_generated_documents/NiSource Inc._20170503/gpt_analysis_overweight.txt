Based on the insights and financial metrics derived from the recent earnings conference call transcript, there are several key points that indicate a positive future outlook for NiSource. 

Firstly, the company reported strong financial performance with an increase in non-GAAP net operating earnings and operating income in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. This was driven primarily by the impact of long-term infrastructure modernization investments in both the Gas Distribution Operations and Electric Operations segments.

Furthermore, the company's debt level as of March 31 was approximately $7.9 billion, with a weighted average maturity on long-term debt of approximately 13 years and a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.4%. NiSource also maintained net available liquidity of about $789 million, with investment grade credit ratings from the three major agencies.

In terms of financing, the company has filed an ATM equity issuance program with the SEC, consistent with their approach outlined at their Investor Day in March. NiSource's financing costs are included in their updated 2017 earnings guidance and the long-term earnings and dividend annual growth rates of 5% to 7% through 2020.

Finally, NiSource's transformation program, aimed at flattening future O&M expenses, is expected to lead to a stable financial foundation and continued growth.

Based on these insights and financial metrics, the 'overweight' investment stance is recommended for the company. The strong financial performance, investment in infrastructure modernization, solid credit profile, and consistent growth outlook provide a compelling case for a positive future outlook for NiSource.
