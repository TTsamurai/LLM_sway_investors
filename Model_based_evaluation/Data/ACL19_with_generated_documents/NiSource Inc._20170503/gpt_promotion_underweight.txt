Based on NiSource's recent earnings call, the company reported strong financial performance in the first quarter of 2017, with increases in both non-GAAP net operating earnings and operating income. However, there are several aspects of the earnings call that warrant a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company.

First, NiSource's debt level as of March 31 was approximately $7.9 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5.4%. While the company maintains investment-grade credit ratings from major agencies, the high levels of debt and interest rates may pose a risk to the company's financial stability in the long run.

Additionally, NiSource reported increased operating expenses in both its Gas Distribution Operations and Electric Operations segments, driven by factors such as increased O&M, depreciation expenses, and property taxes. While the company has attributed these increases to infrastructure modernization investments and environmental spending, the potential for continued elevated expenses raises concerns about the company's profitability in the future.

Furthermore, NiSource announced an ATM equity issuance program with the SEC, indicating that the company plans to raise capital through equity offerings. This suggests that NiSource may be turning to external financing to fund its infrastructure investment programs, potentially diluting existing shareholders' ownership in the company.

Moreover, NiSource's planned merger of NiSource Finance with NiSource, Inc may raise regulatory approval concerns and could introduce complexities in the company's legal and financial structures.

In light of these factors, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' stance on investment in NiSource. While the company has shown solid financial performance in the first quarter, the potential risks associated with its debt levels, operating expenses, equity issuance program, and merger plans warrant caution in evaluating the company's investment prospects.
