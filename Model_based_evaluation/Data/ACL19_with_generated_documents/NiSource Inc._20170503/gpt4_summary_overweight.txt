2. **Segment-Level Performance:**
   - **Gas Distribution Operations** reported a $34 million increase in operating earnings, rising to about $364 million. This was driven by new rates from base rate cases and infrastructure replacement programs.
   - **Electric Operations** indicated a $12 million increase to about $84 million in operating earnings, supported by new rates and higher capital spending on transmission projects.
