### Future Outlook Report: NiSource Inc. (Overweight Stance)

#### Executive Summary:
NiSource Inc. has reported impressive financial results for the first quarter of 2017, exhibiting strong growth in earnings and revenue across multiple segments. The company is advancing significant infrastructure modernization investments that are driving solid financial performance. Given the strategic investments in infrastructure, the positive regulatory environment, and strong financial metrics, an overweight investment stance is recommended.

#### Financial Performance:
- **Earnings Growth:** NiSource has raised its full-year 2017 guidance to the upper half of the $1.12 to $1.18 non-GAAP net operating earnings per share, bolstered by Q1 earnings of $0.71 per share, up from $0.62 in Q1 2016.
- **Revenue Growth:** Significant revenue increases have been witnessed in both the Gas Distribution and Electric Operations segments. Net revenues in these segments have risen due to new rates from base rate cases and increased capital spending, particularly in infrastructure and transmission projects.

#### Key Drivers:
- **Infrastructure Investments:** Long-term investments in infrastructure are the main driver behind the increased earnings and revenue. These investments not only enhance capacity and safety but also contribute positively towards regulatory approval for rate hikes.
- **Regulatory Environment:** The company operates with forward-looking rates which have embedded much of the operation and maintenance costs. This regulatory foresight enhances earnings predictability and stability.

#### Financial Stability and Liquidity:
- **Debt Profile:** NiSource maintains a healthy credit profile with investment-grade ratings from major agencies (S&P: BBB+, Moody's: Baa2, Fitch: BBB). The company reported $7.9 billion in debt with a manageable interest rate of 5.4% and a long maturity profile averaging 13 years.
- **Liquidity:** NiSource ended Q1 with robust net liquidity of approximately $789 million, ensuring sufficient financial flexibility to support ongoing and future investments.

#### Growth Prospects and Strategy:
- **Earnings and Dividend Growth:** NiSource targets a sustainable annual growth rate of 5% to 7% in earnings and dividends through 2020, reflecting strong operational execution and financial discipline.
- **Strategic Financing:** The introduction of an ATM equity issuance program aligns with NiSource’s strategy to balance financing its significant infrastructure projects, thereby supporting growth without jeopardizing financial stability.

#### Risks and Considerations:
- **Regulatory Approvals:** The planned merger with NiSource Finance, aimed at simplifying corporate structure and reducing administrative overhead, still requires regulatory approval. Any delay or issues in obtaining approval could impact financial strategies and operational efficiency.
- **Operational Risks:** While infrastructure investments are substantial, they also bring associated risks including execution and operational risks. Moreover, fluctuating interest rates could affect the cost of capital and debt servicing capabilities.

#### Conclusion:
NiSource Inc. is well-positioned for future growth, supported by strategic infrastructure investments and a stable regulatory environment that facilitates predictable revenue streams. The company’s commitment to maintaining strong financial health and pursuing growth via strategic investments underpins the recommendation for an overweight stance. Investors should consider NiSource’s stable growth trajectory, robust financial position, and progressive investment strategies as foundational elements for a promising investment opportunity.
