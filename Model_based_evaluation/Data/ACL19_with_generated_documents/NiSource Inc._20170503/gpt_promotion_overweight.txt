The company has maintained net available liquidity of about $789 million, consisting of cash and available capacity under their credit facility, and their credit ratings at the three major agencies are investment grade. Standard & Poor's rates NiSource at BBB+; Moody's at Baa2; and Fitch at BBB, all with stable outlook.

The company has also filed an ATM equity issuance program with the SEC as part of their balanced approach to financing their infrastructure investment programs. This, along with the company's solid financial foundation, is poised for continued growth and has led to an updated 2017 earnings guidance and long-term earnings and dividend annual growth rates of 5% to 7% through 2020.

In light of these strong financial results, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on NiSource. The company's consistent earnings growth, solid financial foundation, and balanced financing approach make it an attractive investment opportunity for investors seeking long-term growth and stability.
