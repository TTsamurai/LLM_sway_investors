**Investment Analysis Report: Underweight Recommendation for NiSource Inc.**

**Executive Summary:**
After reviewing NiSource Inc.’s (NYSE: NI) most recent earnings call and associated financial documentation, this report aims to present a cautious perspective on the company's future financial health and stock performance. Despite a promising portrayal of initial performance forwards for 2017, there are critical areas of concern that suggest an underweight position may be prudent for risk-averse investors.

**1. Rising Operational Costs:**
NiSource has reported a recurring increase in operational and maintenance expenses (O&M), depreciation expenses, and property taxes in its Gas Distribution Operations segment. This increase nearly offsets the revenue gains from new base rate cases and infrastructure replacement programs. Similarly, the Electric Operations segment is strained by new O&M expenses. While the company expects operational expenses to eventually stabilize post-2017, courtesy of their transformation program, there is no immediate relief observable, implying potential strain on profits.

**2. Heavy Debt Load:**
As of March 31, NiSource's debt levels were about $7.9 billion, a significant financial burden with an average interest rate of approximately 5.4%. Although the company maintains that its credit profile is solid with investment-grade ratings (BBB+ by S&P, Baa2 by Moody’s, and BBB by Fitch), the high level of outstanding debt can drastically affect its flexibility and responsiveness to adverse market conditions.

**3. Dependency on Regulatory Approvals:**
A substantial portion of NiSource's strategy relies on regulatory outcomes, evident from ongoing base rate cases and the pending merger of NiSource Finance into NiSource Inc. Delays or unfavorable decisions in these regulatory proceedings could derail projected financial targets and operational strategies.

**4. Moderate Growth Projections:**
While the company expects an annual earnings and dividend growth rate of 5% to 7% through 2020, these are moderately optimistic projections that hinge on successful execution and favorable external factors such as regulatory support and stable economic conditions. The reliance on tracker programs to maintain close proximity to authorized rates of return (9.5% to 10% ROE) may not suffice in sustaining long-term growth if operational inefficiencies and market dynamics do not align with company forecasts.

**5. Strategic Initiatives and SEC Filings:**
The recent SEC filings regarding an ATM (At The Market) equity issuance program reveal an anticipated need for additional capital. This could either dilute current shareholder value or indicate underlying financial stress that the company is aiming to mitigate through public equity routes.

**Conclusion:**
The financial and operational overview of NiSource Inc., particularly focusing on their high leverage, rising operational costs, dependency on favorable regulatory outcomes, and moderate growth forecasts, raises concerns about its prospective investment return potential. Given these factors, an underweight stance is recommended for portfolio managers seeking to minimize exposure to potential underperformance relative to broader market indices. Investors should adopt a cautious approach, paying close attention to regulatory developments and operational efficiency improvements in subsequent quarters before re-evaluating the company's portfolio weight.

**Recommendations:**
- Monitor NiSource’s regulatory interactions closely, especially outcomes affecting financial forecasts.
- Observe the efficiency and effectiveness of the transformation program in controlling O&M expenses.
- Track market reactions to the ATM equity issuance and its implications for shareholder value.
