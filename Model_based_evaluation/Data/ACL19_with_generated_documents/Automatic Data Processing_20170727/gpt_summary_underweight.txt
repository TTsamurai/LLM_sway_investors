Investment Stance: Adopting an 'underweight' investment stance

Reasoning: Despite ADP's revenue growth and optimism for the future, it faces challenges with declining new business bookings and uncertainty in the mid- and upmarkets. The company's need for head count investments and reliance on economic factors may pose risks to future growth. Additionally, competition and potential impacts of tax reform add to the investment stance's cautious approach. Therefore, an 'underweight' stance indicates a conservative approach to investing in ADP, considering the aforementioned factors and potential risks in the company's performance.
