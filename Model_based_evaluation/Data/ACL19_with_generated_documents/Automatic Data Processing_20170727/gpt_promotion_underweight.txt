Based on the recent earnings call of ADP, there are several reasons to be cautious or skeptical about the company's performance:

1. Decline in new business bookings: There was a 7% decline in new business bookings for the most recent quarter and a 5% decline for the full year. This performance is disappointing and reflects challenges in the mid- and upmarkets.

2. Impact of regulatory uncertainty: The company cited regulatory uncertainty following the U.S. Election as a contributing factor to the challenges in new business bookings. The uncertainty has impacted decision-making and elongated the sales process, particularly in the upmarket segment.

3. Decline in retention: ADP experienced a decline of 50 basis points in overall retention for the year, predominantly in the mid- and upmarkets. This is a concerning trend, especially when considering the impact on revenue and future growth.

4. Loss of Office of Personnel Management contract: The loss of this contract contributed to the annual decline in retention, and it was concentrated on legacy platforms in the mid- and upmarkets.

5. Slowdown in sales due to regulatory uncertainty: The company indicated that the tightening labor market and regulatory uncertainty following the U.S. Election have slowed sales of solutions related to the Affordable Care Act, contributing to the decline in new business bookings.

6. Potential impact of tax reform: While the company expressed optimism about potential tax reform, there is also uncertainty around the impact of any changes on ADP's business.

In conclusion, the recent earnings call raises concerns about the company's performance and growth prospects, particularly in the mid- and upmarkets. The impact of regulatory uncertainty, decline in new business bookings, and challenges in retention are reasons to approach investment in ADP with caution. Based on the information from the earnings call, a recommendation for an 'underweight' investment stance on ADP may be prudent at this time.
