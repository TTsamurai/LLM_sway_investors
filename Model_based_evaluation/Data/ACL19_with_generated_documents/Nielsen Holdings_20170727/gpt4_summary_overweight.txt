**Key Financial Metrics and Performance Highlights:**

1. **Revenue**: The company reported total revenue of $1.64 billion, marking an increase of 3% on a GAAP-reported basis.

On a non-GAAP, constant-currency basis, total revenue was up by 4.1%.

2. **Net Income**: GAAP net income amounted to $131 million, with earnings per share at $0.37. This figure highlights growth driven by revenue increases, margin expansion, and reduced restructuring charges.
