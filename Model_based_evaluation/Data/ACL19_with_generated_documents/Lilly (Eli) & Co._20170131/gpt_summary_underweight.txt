Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, the financial metrics of this company indicate some areas of concern, leading to an 'underweight' investment stance. It is noted that revenue growth was 6%, with FX and 7% in constant currency terms, while non-GAAP EPS grew 3% with FX and 7% in constant currency. This implies that the company's growth is relatively slow, and there is little improvement in financial performance despite favorable exchange rates.

Additionally, the gross margin percent did not see the improvement that was expected due to the negative pricing in the insulin business, which is the company's largest product. This indicates a lack of profitability and cost-effectiveness in certain product lines, which could pose a risk to the company's financial health.

Furthermore, the company's guidance for 2017 suggests that there is a focus on improving margins and achieving EPS of $4.05 to $4.15, which is only a slight increase from the previous year. This conservative outlook does not signal strong growth potential in the near future, and the company's performance in 2016 was only on the lower end of their guidance range.

Overall, the company's financial performance and outlook suggest limited growth potential, which warrants an 'underweight' investment stance. There are concerns about slow revenue growth, lack of margin improvement, and conservative guidance, which could impact the company's stock performance in the near future.
