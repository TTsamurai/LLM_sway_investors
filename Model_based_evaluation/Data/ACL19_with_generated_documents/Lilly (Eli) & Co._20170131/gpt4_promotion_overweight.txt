This success is matched by Jardiance, whose new-to-therapy share leaped to 35%, overshadowing competitors such as Invokana.

Further, noteworthy contributions from Talz in the IL-17A psoriasis class, and strong sales from the newly launched Lartruvo in the U.S. and Europe for soft tissue sarcoma add to our robust portfolio.

Our plans to launch three more products by the end of 2018 underscore our commitment to continuous innovation and market expansion.

Moreover, the recent upholding of the Alimta vitamin regimen patent fortifies our competitive edge, safeguarding our market share against generic competition.
