Based on the recent earnings call, it is clear that the company is experiencing strong revenue growth driven by new product launches. However, there are several factors that should prompt caution when considering an investment in the company.

First, it is important to note that the company's gross margin percent did not see the improvement that may have been expected. This was driven by a mix effect, particularly in the insulin business where negative pricing has become a drag on the gross margin percent.

Second, there is uncertainty surrounding the impact of dual-eligibles on the company's performance, with management likening it to the impact of the Affordable Care Act on the healthcare industry. This uncertainty could pose risks to the company's future growth prospects.

Additionally, while the company has provided financial guidance for 2017, it is worth noting that in 2016, the company came in on the lower end of its guidance range. This suggests that achieving the projected $4.05 to $4.15 in EPS for 2017 may not be guaranteed.

Furthermore, the company's growth prospects are subject to policy and environmental uncertainty, which could affect its ability to deliver on its innovation strategy and drive volume growth through new brands.

In conclusion, while the company has demonstrated strong revenue growth and has ambitious plans for new product launches, there are several factors that warrant a cautious or skeptical stance on investment in the company. As such, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended until there is more clarity on the impact of these factors on the company's performance.
