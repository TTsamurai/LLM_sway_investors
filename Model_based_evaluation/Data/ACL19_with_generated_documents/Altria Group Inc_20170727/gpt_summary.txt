The financial analyst report on the earnings conference call transcripts:

Altria delivered solid results for the second quarter and first half of 2017. The smokeable products segment generated strong income growth despite the cigarette excise tax increase in California, and the smokeless products segment largely rebounded from its first quarter product recall. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 4.9% in the second quarter and 3.3% for the first half of 2017.

In the smokeable products segment, adjusted operating companies income grew 6.4% in the second quarter and 7.2% for the first half despite the tax increase in California. However, Marlboro's retail share declined in California due to the tax increase. The company expects this decline to moderate over time.
