**Company: Altria Group, Inc.**

**Recommendation: Overweight**

---

### Overview:
Altria reported solid financial results for Q2 and H1 2017, driven by strong performance in its smokeable and smokeless products segments. Despite facing significant regulatory challenges, such as an excise tax increase in California, the Company managed to sustain growth across key financial metrics. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew by 4.9% in Q2 and 3.3% in H1 2017.

### Key Financial Metrics:

- **Smokeable Products Segment:**
  - Q2 adjusted operating income growth: 6.4% 
  - H1 adjusted operating income growth: 7.2%
  - Volume hit by the California tax increase but was partially offset by strong pricing and stable market share outside California.

- **Smokeless Products Segment:**
  - Q2 adjusted operating income growth: 9.8%
  - H1 adjusted operating income growth: 1.6%
  - Volume growth of 1.4% in Q2; retail share grew sequentially by 0.6 points despite earlier product recall impacts.

- **E-Vapor and Heated Tobacco Products:**
  - MarkTen brand grew significantly in retail share, reaching approximately 13% in mainstream channels.
  - FDA commenced substantive review of PMI's modified risk application for IQOS.

### Investment Insights:
1. **Robust Pricing Strategy:**
   - Altria demonstrated strong pricing capabilities that helped offset the volume declines in the smokeable products segment, indicating robust pricing power in a challenging regulatory environment.

2. **Innovation and Expansion:**
   - Planned national expansion of Marlboro Black Menthol 72’s and ongoing growth of the MarkTen e-vapor brand showcase Altria’s focus on catering to demographic shifts and preferences in tobacco usage, particularly among younger adults.

3. **Resilience to Tax Hikes:**
   - Although the California excise tax hike impacted volume, Altria's experience and strategy helped mitigate its effect. The company anticipates a continued, albeit moderated, impact of around 1% on industry volumes.

4. **Strategic Focus on Reduced-Risk Products:**
   - The ongoing FDA reviews and Altria’s readiness for potential commercialization of IQOS in the U.S. position the company at the forefront of the shift towards reduced-risk tobacco products.

5. **Strong H2 Outlook:**
   - Altria reaffirms its full-year guidance aiming for 7.5% to 9.5% adjusted diluted EPS growth, energized by expected moderation of earlier headwinds and inclusion of equity earnings from its beer investments in Q4.

### Risks:
- Regulatory pressures and excise tax hikes continue to pose risks to volume. Nevertheless, Altria's strong brand equity and strategic price management seem to adequately buffer these challenges.
- Competitive dynamics in innovation-centric segments like e-vapor and heated tobacco are intensifying. However, Altria’s significant investments and market strategy are designed to handle competitive threats effectively.

Adopting an 'overweight' investment stance, it is advisable to increase portfolio exposure to Altria given its demonstrated resilience in managing regulatory impediments, strategic innovations, and robust financial performance outlook for the second half of the year. The company’s skillful navigation through a shifting tobacco landscape and proactive responses to market and regulatory changes highlight its potential for sustainable growth.
