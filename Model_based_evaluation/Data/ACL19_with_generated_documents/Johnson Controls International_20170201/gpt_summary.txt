- Restructuring and impairment charge of $78 million primarily severance-related.
- Lump sum pension buyout in connection with the Adient spinoff resulted in a $117 million gain.
- Non-recurring purchase accounting expenses and discrete tax benefit led to a $0.14 charge, resulting in diluted EPS of $0.53.

2. Financial Performance:
- First quarter revenues were up slightly at $7.1 billion, with organic sales up 1%.
- Gross margin remained constant at 31.2%, and SG&A was down 3% due to cost reduction initiatives and merger synergies.

- Net financing charges were $119 million, slightly higher than the previous year.

3. Cash Flow and Balance Sheet:
- Adjusted cash flow for the quarter was an outflow of $300 million due to one-time expected payments related to the Adient spin-off and restructuring.
- Net debt to cap ratio decreased to 33.6% from 39.7% at year-end, driven by the reduction in equity as part of the Adient spin-out.
- Share repurchase program commenced in Q2, with an expected buyback of $200 million to $250 million of shares during fiscal 2017.

4. Outlook and Guidance:
- Projections for fiscal second quarter include organic sales up 2% and EPS at $0.48 to $0.50, representing a 7% to 11% year-over-year increase.
- Guidance reaffirmed for full-year EPS of $2.60 to $2.75, representing a year-over-year increase of 13% to 19%.
- Expectations for a strong fiscal 2017, with confidence in delivering solid financial performance.

Overall, the company demonstrated a strong first quarter performance, with improvements in key financial metrics such as revenues, EBIT margins, and equity income. Despite cash outflows in the first quarter, the company remains focused on delivering adjusted free cash flow of $2.1 billion for the year. The outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year indicates continued growth and performance, with a strong focus on cost synergies and productivity savings. The company's capital structure and debt management are also being evaluated to take advantage of current interest rate environment and future debt maturities.
