Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. The company's first-quarter results show a mix of positive and negative indicators. On the positive side, their Corporate segment expense decreased by 12% year over year, primarily due to productivity initiatives and merger synergies. Additionally, their equity income was 20% higher than the year-ago level, and their diluted EPS increased to $0.53 from $0.48 a year ago. 

However, there are several concerns to note. The company reported special items totaling $0.14, which impacted the reported EPS. Furthermore, their adjusted cash flow was an outflow of $300 million, primarily due to one-time expected payments related to the Adient spin-off. Their net debt to cap ratio increased due to the reduction in equity as part of the Adient spin-out. 

Looking ahead, the company anticipates a reduction in earnings in the second quarter compared to the first, consistent with historic patterns. The CFO also mentioned that there might be a slight build in corporate expenses in the second quarter. Additionally, they anticipate the synergies and productivity savings to ramp up in the second half of the year.

Given the mix of positive and negative indicators, it is prudent to take a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company's stock. The concerns around special items impacting EPS, adjusted cash flow outflow, and the anticipated reduction in earnings in the second quarter raise doubts about the company's near-term financial performance. As a result, taking an 'underweight' investment stance would be advisable.
