Based on the information provided in the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an underweight investment stance on the company. The communication systems segment showed mixed performance with strong revenue growth in legacy tactical, but weaker performance in Australia and international markets. Public safety revenue was down, offset by solid book-to-bill, while electronic systems revenue performed well but was offset by declining operating income. Space and intelligence systems also showed revenue decline, indicating potential weakness in the environmental business. The guidance for fiscal 2018 suggests moderate growth, but the impact of the ADS-B program transition is expected to bring EPS down by $0.22. Additionally, the company's plan to pay down debt, repurchase shares, and pay dividends indicates limited room for further growth in the stock. Overall, the company's performance and guidance suggest caution in investment at this time.
