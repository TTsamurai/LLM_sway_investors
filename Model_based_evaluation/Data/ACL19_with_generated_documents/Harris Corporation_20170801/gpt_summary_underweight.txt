Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance for Harris Corporation. The financial metrics indicate some concerns about the company's performance. Communication Systems revenue in the quarter was up 3% versus prior year, but there are indications of slowing growth in certain areas. Public Safety revenue was down 8% in the quarter and down 5% for the year. Electronic Systems had a 4% revenue growth for the quarter, but operating income declined 15% due to the ADS-B program transition. Space and Intelligence Systems saw a 4% decline in revenue for the quarter and was about flat for the year. The company's fiscal 2018 guidance includes revenue growth of 2% to 4% and EPS growth of 6% to 9%, which appear to be modest targets.

While the company expects improvement in working capital, there are some headwinds and uncertainties related to integration and restructuring costs as well as the ADS-B program transition, which is expected to impact EPS by $0.22. Additionally, the company faces challenges in maintaining strong margins and improving cash flow. The guidance for fiscal 2018, while positive, does not demonstrate significant potential for substantial growth.

Given the concerns about revenue growth, declining margins, and the impact of the ADS-B program transition, we believe it is prudent to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance in Harris Corporation at this time.
