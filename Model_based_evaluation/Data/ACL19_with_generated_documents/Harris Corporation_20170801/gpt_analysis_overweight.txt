of our use of cash. And as you know, we've spoken before, Jason, it's important that we keep a strong balance sheet. So, we've got about 2.9 times total leverage ratio at the end of the year. We've got the commitment that we made to reduce debt by $600 million. So, that's – we feel a lot better about our financial flexibility with that. And also, we're not really focused in bringing debt down in the medium term. So, we've got a – the internal – I think Howard will talk about it in a minute. So, overall, I feel like we've got good financial flexibility, and as we go through fiscal 2018, I think we'll generate a lot of cash and we'll have some opportunities as we fulfill our commitment to the shareholders. With that, Jason, I'll turn it back to Bill. Thanks, Raj. So, Howard, on the operations and CapEx, one of the things that you've talked about a lot is the benefits that we've seen in the restructuring and the integration. So, can you talk a little bit about how that's contributed to our margin improvement and the operational excellence? And then, just give a sense of how we see CapEx trending over the next year or two. Thanks, Bill. Yeah, I'll start with the CapEx. So as we mentioned in the last call, we are targeting about 130, and it's pretty much flat to where we are at in fiscal 2017. That's a situation that we're really comfortable with, because as we look at our business, most of our programs are in an execution phase, and as we wrap up some of the restructuring and integration work that we've been doing over the last few years, we're really going to be optimizing how we're operating and the investment to do that makes a lot of sense for us. So, we're pretty comfortable with that level. On the operational excellence, that's been a pretty big contributor to where we've got where we're at. So, I think the most recent quarter might be a little bit of an enigma because we had some favorable mix and pad on the trailing end of some legacy Exelis programs that helped us out. But that's – we're not expecting that to continue. But as we execute on the restructuring and integration, the team has done an amazing job of executing on our operational excellence initiatives. They've crushed the plan again. So, as the programs continue to ramp up, it's going to continue to drive good things for us. And then we've been really able to leverage that operational excellence with the synergies. The synergy benefits are accelerating and really we're in a pick-up phase on that. So, I think that combination is going to continue to drive the margin expansion that we've been targeting. As we've talked about before, we're kind of in the 20 – the mid-20% of the million range today and we see that as climbing over time. As books, pick up and we execute on the programs, that's really our journey. And outside of that, our factory-level efficiencies, we're really starting to see some of the benefits of that kick in with some programs that are ramping. We have a couple of new programs that are coming in and driving some good volume through the Rochester factory, and it's creating a lot of leverage for us, which is good to see.  And that's all being driven by the operational excellence that we've put into place. So, these are all key signs of what we set out to do, and it's really driving our profitability. Thanks, Howard. Appreciate those insights. So, Bill, just wrapping up, we're seeing a lot of positive momentum in the company, strong operational performance, successful integration, and synergies, and healthy growth across segments. Looking at the guidance for fiscal 2018, it seems the company is well-positioned for continued success and growth. Considering all these factors, I would recommend an 'overweight' investment stance for the company. The strong financial metrics and positive outlook indicate that the company's stock may outperform the market and generate strong returns for investors. Thank you.
