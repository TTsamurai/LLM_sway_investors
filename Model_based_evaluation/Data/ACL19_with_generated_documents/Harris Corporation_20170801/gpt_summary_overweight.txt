The recent earnings conference call transcript indicates that Harris Corporation is experiencing positive growth and improved financial performance across its various segments. The company's Communication Systems segment saw a 3% increase in revenue, with operating income up 22% and margin expansion of 500 basis points. Legacy tactical revenue grew 28% in the quarter, surpassing previous guidance and contributing to full-year revenue growth of 3%, better than previous expectations of flat revenues. International Tactical revenue also increased, with growth in Eastern Europe and signs of positive growth in the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions.

In the Public Safety segment, although revenue was down, the company experienced strong bookings with significant contract wins, such as a $75 million contract from a utility company and a five-year, $461 million IDIQ contract with the U.S. Army.

Electronic Systems revenue was up 4% for the quarter and the year, driven by strength in electronic warfare, the ramp of UAE battle management system, and a strong fourth quarter in avionics. Operating income for the segment was up 5%, with margin expansion of 30 basis points.

Space and Intelligence Systems revenue was flat for the year, with solid demand in classified programs offset by the wind down of some environmental programs. Segment operating income was up 8%, with margin expansion of 120 basis points.

Looking into fiscal 2018 guidance, the company expects revenue to be in the range of $6.02 billion to $6.14 billion, representing a 2% to 4% increase for the year. EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.85 to $6.05, up 6% to 9%. The total company margin is projected to be between 19% and 19.5%. The company also aims to pay down $600 million of debt and achieve an effective tax rate of 28.5%.

Overall, the earnings call demonstrates Harris Corporation's strong financial performance, positive growth in key segments, and a favorable outlook for fiscal 2018. As a financial analyst, I recommend adopting an 'overweight' investment stance on Harris Corporation, given its positive financial metrics and the potential for continued growth and success in the coming year.
