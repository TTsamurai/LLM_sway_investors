Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, there are several key insights and financial metrics that indicate a future outlook for the company should be underweight. Here are some of the reasons for this stance:

1. Communication Systems segment: While revenue for the segment was up 3% versus prior year, the full year segment revenue was down 6% compared to previous guidance of a decline of 7%. This indicates that the segment is not performing as well as expected, and the growth is not enough to warrant a positive outlook.

2. Public Safety segment: Although the segment had a solid book-to-bill and secured significant contracts, the revenue was down 8% in the quarter and down 5% for the year. This suggests that there may be challenges in maintaining revenue levels in the future.

3. Electronic Systems segment: While the segment saw revenue growth of 4% for the quarter and the year, the operating income declined 15% in the quarter. This indicates that despite revenue growth, there are profitability challenges in the segment.

4. Space and Intelligence Systems segment: Although the segment saw solid demand in classified programs, the revenue was down 4% for the quarter and flat for the year. This indicates that growth in the segment may be limited.

5. Fiscal 2018 guidance: The company's guidance for fiscal 2018 indicates only modest revenue growth and a slight increase in earnings per share. This suggests that the company may face challenges in achieving significant growth in the upcoming year.

Overall, the financial metrics and insights from the earnings conference call suggest that the company may face challenges in achieving significant growth and profitability in the near future, warranting an underweight investment stance.
