**Recommendation:**
Based on the information from the earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on CarMax. The company's sales growth has been driven by online customer experience and digital initiatives, but the impact of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma on store closures and damaged vehicles will likely have a negative impact on future sales. Additionally, the increase in website traffic and SEO efforts may not be enough to offset the potential sales impact from the natural disasters. The company's expenses have also increased, and the uncertainty of future weather events and their impact on sales and acquisitions should be considered when evaluating an investment in CarMax.
