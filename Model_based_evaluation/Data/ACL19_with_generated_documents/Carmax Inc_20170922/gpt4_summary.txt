### Summary Report: Quarterly Earnings Conference Call

**Company Overview:**
CarMax has delivered another robust quarter despite operational challenges posed by external events such as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The company has demonstrated resilience and adaptability, maintaining strong growth metrics supported by effective strategic and operational initiatives.

**Key Financial Metrics and Insights:**

1. **Sales Performance:**
   - **Used Unit Comps:** Increased by 5.3%.
   - **Total Used Units:** Grew by 11.1%, driven by effective store execution and enhancements to the online customer experience, which improved conversion rates, although this was slightly offset by lower store traffic.
   - **Website Traffic:** Saw a 17% growth, partly due to improved search engine optimization (SEO) efforts.

2. **Financial Results:**
   - **Gross Profit per Used Unit:** Remained stable at $2,178 (from $2,160 the previous year).
   - **Wholesale Units:** Slight growth noted, with gross profit per wholesale unit increasing to $950 from $870, primarily due to a favorable depreciation environment.

3. **Operational Impact from Hurricanes:**
   - **Hurricane Harvey:** Forced the closure of six Houston stores for 5.5 days, with minimal impact on comps. The company provided financial assistance and supplies to approximately 1,000 affected associates.
   - **Hurricane Irma:** Closed 28 stores primarily in Florida and Georgia. Sales expected to recover in subsequent periods.

4. **Strategic Initiatives:**
   - **Store Expansion:** Opened three new stores and plans to open five more in the third quarter, continuing to expand both national footprint and market reach.
   - **Digital Innovation:** Rolled out an online appraisal tool in Charlotte market stores, with plans for further expansion. Also, progress on digital merchandising including 360-degree vehicle interior photos, enhancing online customer interaction.

5. **Financial Strategy:**
   - **SG&A Expenses:** Rose nearly 11% to $405 million due to an expanded store base and higher sales variable costs, partially offset by a decrease in share-based compensation expenses.
   - **Financing Operations:** Continues to adjust financing rates based on market conditions and portfolio performance, showing preparation for increased vehicle inflow post-hurricanes.

6. **Market Trends:**
   - The focus on a younger vehicle sales mix (zero to four-year-old vehicles increased to 80% of sales).
   - A shift towards larger vehicles with medium and large SUVs, and trucks comprising a higher percentage of total sales.

**Conclusion:**
CarMax is navigating market challenges effectively with a strong emphasis on enhancing customer experience both online and in-store, prudent financial management, and strategic market expansion. Ongoing digital initiatives and store expansion align well with broader industry trends towards digital integration and geographical diversification. The companyâ€™s ability to maintain operational continuity and support its workforce during natural disasters further solidifies its market position and operational resilience.
