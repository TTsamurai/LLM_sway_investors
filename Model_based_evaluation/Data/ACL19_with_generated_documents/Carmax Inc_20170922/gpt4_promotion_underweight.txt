**Underweight Investment Recommendation on CarMax, Inc.**

**1. Overview:**

CarMax, Inc. reported a steady quarter with notable progress in several areas such as digital initiatives and store expansion. However, a deeper analysis of the earnings call and the underlying business factors prompts a cautious outlook on the stock. Our recommendation is to classify CarMax as 'underweight' based on the analysis below.

**2. Factors Supporting the Underweight Recommendation:**

**a. Economic Sensitivity and Over-reliance on Market Conditions:**
CarMax's business is significantly sensitive to economic cycles. The used car market can be volatile, and while CarMax has managed certain economic headwinds, such as hurricane impacts and shifts in vehicle depreciation rates, its heavy reliance on continuous favorable market conditions poses a risk.

**b. Increasing SG&A Expenses:**
While gross profits per unit have remained stable, SG&A expenses have increased by approximately 11% to $405 million. Despite a slight per-unit cost decrease, the continuous rise in overall SG&A in the context of expansion and digital innovation projects could pressure profitability if growth plateaus or market conditions shift unfavorably.

**c. Store Traffic Concerns:**
Despite strong online traffic growth, there's an observable decline in physical store traffic. This trend raises concerns about the potential long-term impacts on in-store sales and operational leverage. While the shift towards digital is in line with broader retail trends, it could impact the profitability of physical locations over time.

**d. Competitive and Market Pressures:**
The used car market is becoming increasingly competitive with new entrants and evolving consumer preferences. CarMax's expansion and enhancement in digital capabilities are necessary to maintain its market position, but these are also capital intensive. The landscape has new technological advancements that could disrupt traditional models, including CarMax's.

**e. Interest Rate Sensitivity:**
CarMax finances a significant portion of its customer purchases. As interest rates rise, there may be a constraining effect on consumer financing uptake, affecting sales volumes and profit margins. Additionally, interest rates impact floor plan financing costs and overall capital structure.

**3. Environmental and Temporary Factors:**

CarMax demonstrated robustness in handling the impact of hurricanes by leveraging its national footprint and transportation networks. However, these environmental events also introduced temporary volatility in sales and operational disruptions. While management expects to recuperate lost sales, the recurrence of such events adds an element of unpredictability that could affect performance intermittently.

**4. Conclusion:**

While CarMax is a strong player in the used car industry and shows promising strides in digital initiatives and market expansion, the potential headwinds arising from economic sensitivity, increased operational costs, changing market dynamics, and environmental uncertainties create a cautious outlook. As such, an 'underweight' recommendation is advised for investors seeking lower risk exposure, pending more robust signs of sustainable operational leverage and market conditions that favorably support CarMax's business model.
