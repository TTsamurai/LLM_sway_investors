. Thank you.

Based on the insights and financial metrics from the recent earnings conference call, here are the key points for the future outlook report adopting an 'underweight' investment stance:

1. Hurricane Impact: The company reported that Hurricane Harvey had a small impact on its comps due to store closures, but they expected to make up the sales in future periods. Hurricane Irma also resulted in store closures, but the impact on sales is yet to be determined. The company remains prepared to meet any incremental demand for replacement vehicles in the affected areas.

2. Online Initiatives: The company is focused on driving innovation and enhancing the online customer experience. They are testing new initiatives such as online appraisal tools and digital merchandising. These initiatives are still in the testing phase and the impact on sales and customer experience is yet to be determined.

3. Digital Capabilities: The company has seen significant growth in website traffic and non-brand SEO traffic. They continue to invest in technology and digital initiatives to improve the customer experience, but the full impact on sales and conversion rates is yet to be realized.

4. Sales and Margins: The company reported an increase in used unit comps and gross profit per used unit. However, they also highlighted an increase in SG&A expenses, which impacted the overall margins. It remains to be seen if the expense growth can be offset by sales growth in future periods.

5. Market and Pricing: The company noted that there has been a favorable depreciation environment, leading to higher acquisition prices for vehicles. The impact of recent weather events on the overall market and used car prices is still uncertain.

In conclusion, based on the insights and financial metrics from the recent conference call, the company's future outlook with an 'underweight' investment stance is influenced by the uncertainty surrounding the impact of recent weather events, ongoing testing of online initiatives, and potential challenges in managing expenses and margins. As a financial analyst, it is important to closely monitor the company's performance in the coming quarters to assess the actual impact of these factors on the company's financial health and growth prospects.
