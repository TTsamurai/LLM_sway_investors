. Thank you for your thorough analysis. Given the impact of Hurricane Harvey and the uncertainty surrounding the impact of Hurricane Irma, it is clear that management has taken proactive measures to support their associates and ensure business continuity. The financial impact of these events on the company's sales and operations is expected to be minimal and manageable in the long run. However, there are several key financial metrics that we need to consider in adopting an 'underweight' investment stance.

Firstly, the impact of higher conversion on comps was partially offset by the effects of lower store traffic due to weather events. This suggests that the overall sales performance may not be as strong as initially anticipated.

Secondly, the growth in used unit comps and total used units is positive, but it is crucial to monitor the impact of the storms and potential disruptions in the marketplace.

Additionally, the company's focus on technology and digital initiatives to improve the customer experience, particularly in the areas of online appraisals and digital merchandising, may drive enhanced engagement and sales in the future. However, the timeline for these initiatives and their potential impact on financial metrics is uncertain.

Lastly, the increase in expenses, particularly SG&A expenses, should be closely monitored as it may impact profitability and margins. It is important for investors to assess the overall impact of these expenses on the company's financial health.

In conclusion, while CarMax has demonstrated resilience in the face of recent challenges, the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the hurricanes and the company's ongoing investments in digital initiatives warrant a cautious approach. We recommend an 'underweight' investment stance and will continue to monitor key financial metrics closely.
