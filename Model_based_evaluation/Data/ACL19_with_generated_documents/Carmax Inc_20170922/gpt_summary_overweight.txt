**Summary Report**

CarMax recently held an earnings conference call to discuss their second quarter results, which were impacted by Hurricane Harvey in the Houston area. Despite the challenges, the company reported strong results with a 5.3% increase in used unit comps and an 11.1% growth in total used units. The impact of Hurricane Harvey on the store closures was small, and the company has supported affected associates with financial assistance and pay for scheduled shifts. The company also discussed the impact of Hurricane Irma, stating that all stores are open for business and any delayed sales are expected to be realized in future periods.

Key financial metrics discussed on the call included an increase in website traffic by 17% and consistent gross profit per used unit at $2,178. Additionally, the wholesale unit gross profit increased to $950, largely due to a favorable depreciation environment. The company's store base has grown, resulting in an 11% increase in SG&A expenses, but with a reduction of $9 per unit.

The company provided updates on various initiatives, such as the expansion of online appraisal tools and digital merchandising, as well as the opening of new stores in different markets. They also emphasized their focus on innovation and customer experience, highlighting the success of their online initiatives and the combination of online and in-store capabilities.

During the question-and-answer session, further details on specific initiatives, such as the online appraisal tool and home delivery, were discussed. The company also addressed concerns about the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma on sales, the quality of leads, and the competitive landscape.

Overall, CarMax remains focused on driving execution and innovation, with a strong emphasis on enhancing the customer experience across both online and in-store channels. The company's ability to respond to weather events and support its associates, while maintaining a strong financial performance, signals its resilience and commitment to continued success.

As a financial analyst, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance for CarMax based on the company's resilience in the face of challenges, strong financial performance, and ongoing focus on innovation and customer experience. Key financial metrics, such as sales growth, website traffic, and gross profit per used unit, demonstrate the company's solid performance and potential for continued growth. Additionally, the company's strategic initiatives in digital and online capabilities position it well for future market opportunities.
