Dear Investors,

During our recent earnings conference call, we discussed the second quarter financial results and highlighted key trends in our business. Despite some challenges, we are pleased with our overall performance and are confident in our ability to drive growth and value in the months ahead. Hence, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance based on the following key financial metrics:

1. Adjusted EBITDA: Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA met our target, reflecting our ability to control expenses and manage the integration planning activities related to the Level 3 acquisition.
2. Enterprise High-Bandwidth Data Services Revenue: While the growth was slower than the prior quarter, we achieved a 1% year-over-year increase in revenue, and a 5% increase when adjusting for contracted price reductions in wholesale.
3. MPLS Market Performance: We outperformed market growth projections for MPLS services, particularly in the SMB segment, and expect improved revenue recognition in the third and fourth quarters.
4. New Product Launches: We introduced several new products, including CenturyLink Ethernet services, SD-WAN bundles, small business VoIP, and a comprehensive managed Enterprise offering, which are expected to drive future revenue growth.
5. Network Virtualization and Security Services: We continue to lead in network virtualization and have seen increased sales of our security services, highlighting the importance of our offerings to Enterprise customers.
6. Forecasted Growth Opportunities: Third-party research projects mid-single-digit compounded annual growth rates for U.S. Enterprise high-bandwidth data services and mid to upper single-digit rates for U.S. Managed Network Services through 2021, providing confidence in future growth prospects.
7. IT Services Revenue and Managed Hosting Turnaround: Our IT services revenue, driven by IT consulting, cybersecurity, and big data and analytics, is growing, and our managed hosting business showed a solid turnaround in the second quarter.
8. Consumer Broadband: While we experienced higher subscriber losses due to cable competition, our efforts to pivot towards higher-quality, more profitable sales and improved customer retention strategies are expected to drive positive trends in the last half of the year.
9. Consumer Video: We made strategic changes to focus on profitability and customer lifetime value, impacting top-line revenue but aligning with our long-term business goals.
10. Legacy Services Revenue: While revenue from legacy services continues to decline, we aim to manage the transition to IP-enabled services and minimize the impact on our overall business.

In addition to our operational performance, we provided an update on the pending acquisition of Level 3, emphasizing our progress in obtaining necessary approvals and concluding integration planning. We are confident in achieving the targeted annual run rate operating and capital cash synergies once the transaction is completed by the end of September.

Further, while acknowledging the recent litigation regarding our consumer billing practices, we are actively responding to and investigating the allegations, reaffirming our commitment to honesty, integrity, and fairness in running our business.

Overall, we remain optimistic about our future prospects and look forward to driving growth and value in the months and years ahead.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
