In light of the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on CenturyLink. Despite meeting adjusted EBITDA targets, the company's second quarter colo revenue was below expectations, with higher losses in legacy revenues and broadband unit losses. Growth in MPLS revenues was slower than anticipated, and the consumer broadband subscriber loss was higher than expected due to stronger cable competition and aggressive pricing.

Additionally, the company is currently facing litigation regarding consumer billing practices, which has resulted in a wrongful termination lawsuit and a class action lawsuit in multiple states. The Minnesota Attorney General has also filed a lawsuit against CenturyLink alleging improper sales and billing practices, further adding to the company's legal challenges. These allegations and lawsuits may pose a significant risk to the company's reputation and financial stability.

Furthermore, the pending acquisition of Level 3 presents integration challenges and potential customer disruption. While the company is confident in achieving synergies from the acquisition, the delays in customer decision-making and the need to rationalize sales teams may impact revenue streams.

In conclusion, the cautious or skeptical perspective on CenturyLink is based on declining revenues and legal challenges, as well as potential disruptions from the pending acquisition. It is advised to approach investment in CenturyLink with caution and consider an 'underweight' stance until there is more clarity on the company's ability to address these challenges and drive future growth.
