**Future Outlook Report: CenturyLink**

**Introduction:**
The following report synthesizes insights and financial metrics from the recent earnings call of CenturyLink, guiding the investment stance to “overweight.” This stance is influenced by stable financial performance and initiatives that display potential for significant growth, despite some present challenges.

**Overview of Current Financial and Operational Status:**
CenturyLink's recent earnings call reflected a mixed financial performance. While the company faced setbacks such as below-expected colocation revenue and a higher loss of broadband customers, it met its adjusted EBITDA targets, showing strong cost management and expense control. The integration of Level 3 is progressing well, which management expects will lead to substantial cost synergies.

**Key Growth Drivers:**
1. **High-Bandwidth and Managed Network Services:**
   CenturyLink is confident in the expanding market for high-bandwidth data services, which are forecasted to grow at a mid-single-digit CAGR through 2021. The company has also demonstrated a 5% year-over-year increase in enterprise high-bandwidth services, outpacing market projections. The introduction of innovative products such as CenturyLink Ethernet and bundled SD-WAN services should further propel this growth.

2. **Focus on Customer Retention and Service Expansion:**
   Enhanced efforts in customer retention have started yielding lower credits and adjustments. The rollout of competitively priced products, including a cloud-enabled small business VoIP offering, positions CenturyLink favorably against competitors.

3. **Strategic Acquisitions and Integrations:**
   The ongoing acquisition of Level 3 is a critical strategic move, expected to be completed by the end of September. This merger is anticipated to realize $975 million in annual run-rate operating and capital cash synergies, enhancing CenturyLink’s service offerings and market competitiveness.

4. **Technology and Innovation:**
   The company continues to lead in network virtualization and has launched new managed enterprise services, strengthening its position in a competitive landscape. The emphasis on cybersecurity, accelerated by the increasing threat landscape exemplified by incidents like WannaCry, also provides a new revenue stream and enhances customer trust.

**Challenges and Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Consumer Broadband and Video Services:**
   CenturyLink has seen a decline in consumer broadband subscribers, attributed to intense competition and aggressive pricing by rivals offering gigabit services. However, strategies such as the “Price for Life” initiative and a focus on upgrading network capabilities to higher speeds are likely to stabilize and potentially reverse this trend.

2. **Legacy Services Decline:**
   Ongoing declines in legacy voice and low-bandwidth data services are a concern due to shifting technology standards and consumer preferences. Transitioning these customers to higher bandwidth services, as well as replacing revenue with new service models, is crucial for maintaining revenue streams.

3. **Regulatory and Legal Challenges:**
   The company faces legal challenges regarding billing practices. However, management is actively engaged in addressing these allegations and reinforcing the company’s commitment to integrity and ethical practices.

**Conclusion and Investment Thesis:**
Based on the robust strategies for growth, resilience in financial management, and initiatives toward technology and service improvements, CenturyLink presents a favorable investment opportunity with potential for substantial returns. We advise an overweight position, highlighting the company’s potential to capitalize on emerging trends and navigate through current market challenges effectively. The successful integration of Level 3 will be pivotal in realizing these forecasts and should be monitored closely as an indicator of future success.
