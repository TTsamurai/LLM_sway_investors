- Total Marketplace revenue also increased by 5% year-over-year to $1.8 billion.
- Classifieds revenue grew by 10% in Q1, with eBay Kleinanzeigen driving strong growth but offset by challenges in the motors vertical and ad monetization pressure from mobile.
- Non-GAAP operating margin was 30%, down 340 basis points from the previous year due to foreign exchange impact and increased expenses in product development and G&A.
- Free cash flow decreased by 7% year-over-year to $447 million, primarily due to lower net income and timing differences in cash tax payment.
- The company announced a $500 million investment in Flipkart, expecting the deal to close in the second half of 2017 and significantly improve their competitive position in the market.
- The company expects non-GAAP EPS of $0.43 to $0.45 per share for the year, representing 0% to 5% year-over-year growth, driven by revenue growth and the net benefit of their share repurchase program, offset by increased investment in user experiences and brand marketing.
- Full-year non-GAAP guidance remains unchanged from January, with the difference between non-GAAP and GAAP EPS primarily consisting of amortization of intangible stock-based compensation and tax impacts from ongoing legal structure realignment.
- The company expects acceleration in their Marketplaces platform and significant progress in redefining the eBay user experience and brand.
- Despite non-linear improvements in their buyer funnel, the company believes that active buyer growth is a metric that should indicate an acceleration in gross merchandise volume (GMV).

Overall, the company showed positive growth in key financial metrics and is making strategic investments to drive further growth and improve the user experience. Based on this information, an 'overweight' investment stance may be appropriate, considering the positive revenue growth and future potential indicated by the company's initiatives.
