 and so that is by no means a meaningful part of the outperformance in the quarter. So strength is across a variety of industries and a variety of applications. We continue to perform extremely well across cutting and welding applications. And so, overall, we are in a very strong position relative to other technologies and non-laser technologies. We are pleased with the current momentum in our business, and our guidance for the second quarter reflects the strength in order flow, particularly in China, North America, and Europe. Additionally, our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to maintain a solid footing in the market despite fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. In conclusion, given the strength in our operating margins, the positive order flow, and the ongoing growth in our key end markets, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company based on our recent earnings call and outlook for the future. Thank you.
