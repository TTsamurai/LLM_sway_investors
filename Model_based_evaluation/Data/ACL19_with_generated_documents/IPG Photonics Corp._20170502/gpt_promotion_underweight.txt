, but it's certainly been an area, where there's been an acceleration. The fine processing applications across a variety of different things, like metal, plastic, other composite materials, the drilling, the welding itself. This cycle comes into play and some of that actually benefits double. It benefits from the cycle as well as the secular drivers that we continue to see. So yeah, and this is probably – towards the heavy end of that variability cycle at the moment. So we've had a tremendously strong performance even in the down cycle of that variability at the beginning of the year. So the answer is yes, and we've seen it in the quarter and we've seen right – of the quarter since to date. So, the only thing that you have to take comfort from not just the amount is the variety and the depth of the variety of applications that we are succeeding at. So I still think the overall environment remains pretty strong. And we're not – giving guidance as we head into the second half of the year, but with the overall continued strength and the order flow is such, I think that the shape to the outlook for the rest of the year will begin to take care by Q3. That's the final point that we see. So, nothing predominant, at worst mixed and at the point where you want that direction to be mixed. Very great question. Basically what I'm looking at here is that the company seems to be in a very good and strong financial position. They had a 38% growth in the first quarter revenue which led to a record $286 million in sales. The decline to $22 million for the quarter is not that big as to call for any worry. The figures are clearly contrasting with the previous year's performance. The company has maintained a strong balance sheet with $863 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and a debt of $40 million. The company also acquired 108,000 shares for $13 million during the quarter. The company has not given any guidance for the second half of the year, which is always a sign of skepticism. Considering all these, I would recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company.
