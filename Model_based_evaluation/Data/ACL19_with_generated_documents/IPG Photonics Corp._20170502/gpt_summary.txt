. We've seen strength in telecom applications, especially in China, as well as in other advanced applications. The growth in these markets has been a driving force behind our strong revenue growth. Additionally, our investments in China have allowed us to expand our customer relationships and overall execution, resulting in new customer wins and displacing other fiber laser makers. 

We continue to see strong growth in our high power laser sales, with a 42% increase year-over-year. This growth is being driven by cutting and welding applications, as well as the increase in demand for high power lasers in new and existing applications. 

On the financial side, our gross margin remains strong at 55%, showing a slight decrease of 20 basis points from Q1 2016, but still at the top end of our guidance range. Our operating margins have also improved, increasing to 35.5% of sales from 33.8% in the first quarter of last year. We have achieved leverage in our sales and marketing, R&D, and G&A expenses despite higher spending related to product development, new applications, and manufacturing processes. 

Our tax rate decreased to 26% in Q1 due to the adoption of revised accounting guidance, resulting in a benefit of $4 million. We expect the tax rate to be approximately 30% in Q2, excluding any effects relating to equity grants. 

Our net income for the first quarter increased by 51.9% to $75 million, with a diluted EPS of $1.38 compared to $0.92 a year ago. Despite a decrease in operating cash flow compared to Q1 2016, we expect to see a significant increase in operating cash flow during the remainder of the year. 

Looking ahead, we expect revenues to be in the range of $320 million to $340 million for the second quarter of 2017, with an anticipated EPS of $1.50 to $1.70. The outperformance in the first half of the year should be added to our initial guidance of 10% to 14% revenue growth in 2017, but it should not be used as an assumption for outperformance in the second half of the year, as our visibility into the back half of the year remains somewhat limited. 

Overall, the trends behind our business are very strong, with indications of continued growth in the second quarter and immense potential for future growth in various applications and regions. We are in a strong position relative to other technologies and even non-laser technologies. Our order flow remains strong, and we continue to see momentum in Europe, North America, China, and other parts of the world. Despite facing some challenges, we are optimistic about our future outlook and expect to see continued success in the coming quarters.
