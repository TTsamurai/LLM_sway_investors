. So, I would say that as part of the overall dynamic that you were hearing in the results, we're seeing strong trends on a number of different levels, both in China and the rest of the world and across a variety of applications. I think the investment in China has clearly been a contributor to that, but it's very broad based across a range of industries and applications, which we're clearly very pleased with. I think the consumer electronics investment cycle is stronger this year. It's been strong, obviously, going back two years, but of course it was stronger this year with more capacity additions than in previous years. I would note that the cycle may moderate a bit later in the year which would slow our rate of growth in the QCW segment, but it's still driving strong performance at the moment. So, overall, we continue to maintain a positive outlook for the company and would recommend an overweight investment stance based on the strong growth trends and financial metrics reported in the recent earnings conference call.
