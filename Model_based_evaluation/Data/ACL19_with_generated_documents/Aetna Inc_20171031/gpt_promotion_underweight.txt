Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. The revenue for the third quarter decreased year-over-year due to a planned reduction in Commercial ACA insured membership, suspension of the health insurer fee, and known Medicaid contract losses. While adjusted pre-tax margin was very strong, there is a projection for top line challenges and a potential decline in adjusted earnings in 2018 due to various factors such as the reintroduction of the industry-wide non-deductible health insurer fee and the negative impact on experience rating in large group insured products. Also, 2019 is not expected to be a growth year, but rather a year for continued investment in Medicare with the hope of growth in Medicaid earnings. This indicates a cautious and skeptical perspective on the company's future performance.
