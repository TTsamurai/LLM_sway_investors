Summary: 
Aetna reported strong third quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $814 million and adjusted earnings per share of $2.45, with year-over-year growth of 11% and 18% respectively. The company's medical membership of 22.2 million is in line with expectations for the period. Adjusted revenue was $14.9 billion, year-over-year decrease driven by a planned reduction in Commercial ACA insured membership, the 2017 suspension of the health insurer fee, and known Medicaid contract losses. However, the company's operating perspective is strong, with an adjusted pre-tax margin of 9.2% and a third quarter total health medical benefit ratio of 81.9%. Cash flow and capital also remain strong, with Health Care and Group Insurance cash flows at approximately 1.5 times net earnings. The company distributed $166 million through their quarterly shareholder dividend and repurchased $545 million of shares during the quarter. The company increased their 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance to approximately $9.75 based on strong third quarter performance and adjusted the 2017 adjusted revenue to approximately $60.5 billion. The company remains confident in their ability to drive long-term adjusted EPS growth over time, with Medicare projected to continue on an above-industry growth trajectory, and opportunities for growth in individual Medicare Advantage and group Medicare Advantage products. The 2018 outlook may be challenged by top-line pressure, the reintroduction of the industry-wide non-deductible health insurer fee, and experience rating pressure in large group insured products. However, there are opportunities for growth, including potential capital deployment to improve adjusted EPS growth, the reduction of losses from exiting individual Commercial products in 2018, and achieving expense efficiencies. The company is focusing on geographic expansion in Medicare, portable Medicare Advantage products, and developing relationships across their network in the Pharmacy Benefit Management (PBM) area. 

Investment Stance: Overweight. Aetna's strong third quarter performance, efficient operating and capital structure, and potential opportunities for growth in Medicare, Medicare Advantage, and expense efficiencies make it a favorable investment choice. Despite potential challenges in the 2018 outlook, the company's strategy and potential for long-term growth warrant an 'overweight' investment stance.
