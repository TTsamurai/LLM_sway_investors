. Good morning, Craig. Thank you for the comprehensive overview of the company's performance and outlook. Based on the insights provided in the earnings conference call, it is evident that the company's research segment continues to be the largest and most profitable, with strong performance and accelerated contract value growth in the traditional Gartner Research business. The addition of the CEB Research segment has provided opportunities for continued growth and integration, with a focus on aligning metrics and harmonizing calculation methodologies.

The events segment also showed strong performance, with double-digit growth and an increase in same-event attendees. The consulting segment experienced growth driven by contract optimization, while the talent assessment and other segment saw some challenges, but improvements were observed towards the end of the quarter.

The company's focus on accelerating investments in the CEB sales force, as well as integration efforts, is expected to drive long-term value and future growth. The goal of achieving synergy from the CEB acquisition is evident in the strategic deployment of resources and the approach to cost management.

In terms of financial metrics, the company reported a 9% growth in combined adjusted revenue and a robust free cash flow conversion, reflecting the consistent high level of free cash flow conversion. Adjusted EBITDA and EPS performance exceeded the top end of the guidance range for the quarter.

The company remains committed to providing transparency and tracking the performance of both the traditional Gartner business and the traditional CEB business. The guidance for 2017 reflects the integration of the new reportable segments and incorporates the CEB acquisition, with a focus on maintaining continued growth and delivering sustained double-digit growth over the long-term.

Overall, the company's future outlook is positive, and the 'overweight' investment stance is justified based on the strong performance, strategic integration efforts, and the potential for continued growth and value creation.
