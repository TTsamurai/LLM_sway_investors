. However, I think over time, we'll see a shift in our mix of business from legacy products to more of the new seat-based products. And again, as we migrate more and more over to the new products, that will also help drive some margin improvement over time, just given the leverage that we can get from those new products. So, that's how I'd think about the margin profile in the long-term. And maybe just as a final thought, we're constantly assessing strategic alternatives for the legacy portfolio of CEB products and services. And again, over time, as we innovate and improve and deliver new seat-based products, that will give us the most opportunity to drive the best long-term financial performance. And as I've said on previous calls, our goal is to drive Gartner research revenues to $10 billion over the long-term and the CEB acquisition significantly strengthens our ability to get there and ensures we can capture virtually all the mission-critical priorities of functional business leaders across all industries and sizes of enterprises worldwide. So, again, we're really excited about the opportunity in front of us. And with that, I'll send it back over to the operator. Thank you.
