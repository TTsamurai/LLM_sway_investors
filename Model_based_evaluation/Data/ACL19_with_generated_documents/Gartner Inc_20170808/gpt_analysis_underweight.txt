. But over time, we expect to see a shift in the product mix as clients see the value in the new seat-based products. And on the revenue side, I think you saw in our prepared remarks, our total contract value was almost $2 billion, up 15% year-over-year, and we continue to drive that growth through strong retention rates, consistent growth of new business, and price increases. So, all in all, the integration is going really well. We are focused on driving growth in both the traditional Gartner business and the acquired CEB business, and we are confident in our ability to capture the vast market opportunities in front of us. Thank you for your questions. We are happy to take more questions at this time. Thank you.
