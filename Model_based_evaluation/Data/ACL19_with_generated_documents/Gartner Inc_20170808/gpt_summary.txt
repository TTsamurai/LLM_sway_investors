. However, over time, we expect migration to the newer, more valuable products. And as we've seen in the Gartner journey, that can actually drive improved retention, improved wallet retention, and continued stickiness with our clients as we continue to innovate and provide more valuable products and services.

So, in summary, over the next several quarters and years, we expect to see continued investment in growing the sales force, continued focus on integrating the sales forces and products, and continued evolution and migration of clients to our newer, more valuable seat-based products. This will drive continued growth and improvement in our key financial metrics across our reportable segments. Thank you for your questions, and we look forward to updating you in future earnings calls.
