. So, it's all part of our strategy just to maximize the client lifetime value, maximize the value that we deliver to our clients and then over time shift them over to products. And then on the cost synergies, Anj, it's happening. I think where most of our teams have really found the most synergy in terms of cost is in the G&A side. So legal, HR, finance, accounting, IT and we're just getting going on procurement. But I think we've seen our teams really go head down. We've had a big chunk of the obviously the transaction cost-related savings already flown through. But I think we're starting to see some good flow through now on the full-time employee-related savings as well, although the bigger chunk of that will probably come in 2018 and then the rest of that $50 million will come into 2019. So, again we're well on track to capture the $50 million that we talked about at the time we announced the transaction. And then the other on CEB, it's a combination of adding some cost as we add some of the Evanta resources to the set that we have now, maintaining the cost base around technology. We have been spending on technology forever and we continue to do that. But as I mentioned earlier too, we are also investing in building out the sales organization, which is going to result in a cost, some of which will flow through to 2018, but we're actually – we actually already added some cost in 2017. So, we talked about getting some net synergies showing up in 2018 with that additional – with the additional investments that CEB will flush through in 2017. And more to your question on the changes to the guidance, we're having a little bit more drag as we look at TA's recent performance. As you heard, we pulled forward some of investments related to CEB and we – we're always going to be adjusting where we think we are as we're now looking at it directly. So, that's where this comes from and we also had some offset in cost across these as well. So, now with all of that and all the integration work that's happening right now, things are – some things are moving a little bit. And then from a macro perspective, I don't think it's really changed at all since we last chatted. At the end of the day, we're a company that's trying to address the mission-critical needs of our clients. That opportunity continues to be large and significant. We are finding organizations wanting to identify us fairly quickly and we're finding that we're able to continue to deliver a good value proposition that is maturing and growing inside of our clients. So, I think the outlook stick, the acquisition is going great and I feel good about moving forward and excited about Q4. And then on the cash flow, Kelley, it's Craig. I think I may have mentioned this earlier, the relative underperformance in Q2. A big chunk of that was some acquisition-related cash flow items that flew through the cash flow there. So, whether it was transaction costs or some acquisition-related expenditures that flowed through there. As well as the purposeful decision to accelerate spending in the CEB side as we looked at – as we're looking at where we are, we saw the opportunity to go do that. So, I think that's where you're seeing a little bit of the underperformance. But we feel good about where we are now through the end of 2017 and the impact of the decisions that we've made will now start to show up in 2018. And I would say that as we see continued strong performance, we feel like we're in the right spot. So, nothing has fundamentally changed around the outlook and our longer-term growth strategy. Great. Well, thank you very much. Well, guys, well thanks very much. I appreciate everyone hanging on the call and appreciate your questions. We couldn't be happier with how Q2 went. And excitingly, people are really gelling out there and delivering value. And so, we just are looking forward to a massive delivery in Q4 on what we showed you in Q2. So, just stay on board and we're excited about where we're heading, and we're seeing it confirmed. We are happy we took the CEB aboard and we feel that that's going well. And so we feel pretty good about it. So, again, thank you to everybody for your continued support and we're excited about our journey together. Thanks everybody.
