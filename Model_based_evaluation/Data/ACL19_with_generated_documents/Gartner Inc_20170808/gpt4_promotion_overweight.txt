**Gartner Inc. (NYSE: IT) Investment Report**

**Recommendation: Overweight**

**1. Overview & Strategic Acquisitions**

Gartner has strategically enhanced its business model and diversified its portfolio through the acquisition of CEB, which has broadened its research and advisory segments. The successful integration of CEB has added valuable assets like Talent Assessment & Other (TA & Other) and new clientele, further bolstering Gartner's market leadership in research.

**2. Strong Performance in Diverse Segments**

**Research:** Gartner's core segment, representing 72% of total revenue, showcased an 11% revenue growth in the recent quarter. The acquisition of CEB has enriched this segment with subscription-based products and strategic advisory services. Adjusted gross contribution margin remains robust, illustrating healthy profitability despite acquisitions like Capterra, SCM World, and L2, which momentarily dip the margin percentages due to integration costs.

**Events:** The addition of CEB's Evanta asset has shown a promising increase, with Events adjusted revenues increasing by 10%. The strategic acquisition positions Gartner to capitalize on both larger symposia and community-centric smaller events, diversifying its events portfolio.

**Consulting and TA & Other:** Both segments depict steady growth and restructuring efforts that have started to yield positive financial results. Particularly, TA & Other is under revitalization to improve performance and has shown an increase in bookings towards the Q2 end.

**3. Financial Strength and Capital Allocation**

Gartner demonstrates exceptional financial discipline with a free cash flow conversion at 126%. Its operational efficiency is highlighted by consistent revenue growth and an EBIDTA of $185 million, outperforming the guidance range. The strong free cash flow supports strategic acquisitions and allows for aggressive debt repayment post-CEB acquisition, keeping the leverage within manageable levels.

**4. Forward-Looking Statements**

With the integration of CEB progressing better than anticipated, Gartner is accelerating its investments in areas likely to fuel long-term growth, such as expanding the CEB salesforce. This preemptive increase in spending aims to capture a significant portion of the market, thereby boosting future revenue streams.

**5. Market Expansion and Outlook**

Gartner's expansion into new research domains, combined with a forceful approach toward integrating and enhancing acquired entities, significantly increases its total addressable market. The updated 2017 guidance reflects this potential, maintaining a promising revenue outlook while adjusting for investments in foundational growth avenues.

**Investment Conclusion**

Based on Gartner’s strategic acquisitions, robust segmental performance, strong financial health, and proactive market capture initiatives, we recommend an overweight position in Gartner Inc. The company displays a foresighted approach, staying ahead of integration curves and market demands, positioning itself for sustained long-term growth. Current and prospective investors are likely to benefit from the company’s dynamic growth strategy and solid execution.
