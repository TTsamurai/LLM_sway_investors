**Future Outlook Report: Overweight Investment Stance**

**Company: Gartner**

**Overview:**
Gartner’s recent acquisition of CEB has restructured its business into four reportable segments: Research, Consulting, Events, and Talent Assessment & Other. The integration is progressing very well, exceeding initial expectations, which motivates an 'overweight' stance. Significant investments are being made to amplify the capabilities and reach of these segments, particularly Research and Sales.

**1. Research:**
The Research segment remains Gartner’s powerhouse, contributing approximately 72% to combined annual revenues and about 80% of gross contributions. The segment has been enhanced by integrating strategic advisory services and substantial portions of CEB’s offerings, which has broadened the scope and depth of Gartner’s research products. Post-CEB acquisition adjustments reflect robust growth with a 15% increase in adjusted revenues for traditional Gartner Research and an 11% increase overall for the combined entity. This segment shows promise with a reported year-on-year total contract value growth of 15%, and client retention at an impressive high of 83%.

**2. Consulting:**
Although smaller in scale, representing just over 9% of combined revenues, the Consulting segment exhibits steady growth. Integration of CEB has refined its offerings, excluding previously included revenues from strategic advisory services. A significant 8% FX-neutral revenue growth was observed due to strong performance in contract optimization.

**3. Events:**
Events have also been augmented by CEB’s assets, predominantly the Evanta asset. The segment represents about 9% of combined revenues with a promising increase in adjusted revenues by 10% year-on-year. The traditional Gartner Events continue to perform strongly with notable improvements in revenue and attendee numbers per event.

**4. Talent Assessment & Other:**
This new segment comprises CEB’s Talent Assessment business and other ancillary services. Although currently experiencing a 6% revenue decline, initiatives are taken to address organizational challenges and recent trends suggest improving performance.

**Financial Metrics and Projections:**
- Adjusted Revenue FY 2017: Expected between $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion.
- Adjusted EBITDA FY 2017: Narrowed guidance range due to accelerated investments for future growth.
- Adjusted EPS FY 2017: Forecast between $3.32 and $3.49, with comprehensive plans to manage seasonal variances and integration costs.

**Investment Considerations:**
- **Cost Synergies**: Proactive measures towards achieving cost synergies, particularly in administrative functions, will impact profitability positively. 2018 targets are firmly on track.
- **Sales Force Expansion**: Accelerated investments in expanding the sales force should yield returns through enhanced coverage and deeper market penetration.
- **Segment Realignment**: Newly formed segments post-acquisition allow for cannier resource allocation and sharper strategic focus.
- **Risk Factors**: Market receptiveness to newly integrated offerings, seasonality in certain business operations (notably Events and Talent Assessment), and integration execution risks.

**Conclusion:**
Despite some ongoing challenges within specific segments, Gartner’s comprehensive integration of CEB, consistent financial performance, and investment in growth capacity substantiate an 'overweight' investment stance. The strategic enhancements to its core segments should fortify its market position and ensure sustained revenue growth and profitability, aligning well with long-term investment considerations.
