. Thank you for providing the transcript. Based on the information provided, here are key insights and financial metrics that support an 'overweight' investment stance:

1. Revenue Growth: The company achieved total revenue of $2.3 billion in Q2, representing a 7% increase on an FX neutral basis. The growth was driven by stable retention, positive momentum in new user acquisition, and strong performance in the U.S. and Korea markets.

2. Share Repurchase: The company repurchased $507 million of its stock in Q2, and the Board of Directors approved an additional $3 billion share repurchase authorization. This shows a commitment to returning capital to shareholders and can contribute to value creation for investors.

3. Marketplace Performance: The Marketplace platform saw a 6% growth in GMV, with particular strength in the U.S. segment. This acceleration in GMV and revenue can be viewed positively and signals potential upside for investors.

4. Cost Management: Despite the overall revenue growth, the company maintained a non-GAAP operating margin of 27.3% in Q2, demonstrating effective cost management strategies.

5. Financial Flexibility: The company raised $2.5 billion of debt in Q2 for general corporate purposes, debt repayment, share repurchases, and potential M&A activity. This indicates a strong capital structure and financial flexibility for strategic investments.

Based on these insights, the company's performance and financial metrics support an 'overweight' investment stance, indicating a favorable outlook for potential returns on investment. The positive momentum in revenue growth, share repurchase activity, marketplace performance, and effective cost management are key factors contributing to this stance.
