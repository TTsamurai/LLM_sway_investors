- Q2 total revenue of $2.3 billion, representing a 7% FX neutral basis increase
- Non-GAAP EPS of $0.45
- Free cash flow of $517 million
- Share repurchase authorization of an additional $3 billion
- GMV of $21.5 billion, up 5%
- US GMV of $8.8 billion, up 30%
- International GMV of $12.7 billion, up 7%
- Total net revenues of $2.3 billion, up 7% on an FX neutral basis
- Marketplace GMV growth of 6%
- Non-GAAP operating margin of 27.3%
- $0.45 non-GAAP EPS, up 5% versus prior year
- $517 million of free cash flow

Based on these metrics, it is evident that the company is performing well and is making significant investments to drive growth and improve user experience. The guidance for Q3 also indicates an expectation of continued revenue growth and investment in brand advertising. As a financial analyst, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance based on the positive momentum and growth prospects highlighted in the transcript.
