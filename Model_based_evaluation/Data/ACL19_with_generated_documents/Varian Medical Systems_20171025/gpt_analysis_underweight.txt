Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that the company's revenue growth has been relatively flat, with a 1-2% decline in oncology revenue in the fourth quarter and a projected 2-4% revenue growth for the fiscal year 2018. Orders increased by 7% in the fourth quarter and the company ended the year with a backlog of $3.5 billion, up 10%. The growth was mainly driven by the Americas and Europe, Middle East, India, and Africa regions, with strong orders from key healthcare customers.

Profitability was impacted by increased SG&A expenses, bad debt expenses, Brazil customs duty charges, and an adjustment to estimated project costs in the proton business. Gross margin decreased in the fourth quarter but increased for the full year, driven by a strong service mix and efforts to optimize the supply chain.

The company continues to invest in R&D, with a focus on software services, big data, and operational efficiency. It also plans to align financial practices and tracking key performance indicators with its long-term growth and value creation strategy.

The guidance for fiscal year 2018 includes revenue growth of 2%-4% and net earnings per diluted share of $4.20 to $4.32. The company aims to achieve operating earnings between 18% to 19% of revenue, cash flow from operations between $475 million and $550 million, and a 23% tax rate for the year, with no change to share count year-over-year.

In summary, the company's growth has been modest, and profitability has been impacted by various expenses. The guidance for fiscal year 2018 indicates a conservative outlook, with a focus on operational efficiency, capital management, and long-term value creation objectives. As a financial analyst, I would recommend adopting an 'underweight' investment stance for the company, considering the modest growth and profitability challenges outlined in the recent conference call.
