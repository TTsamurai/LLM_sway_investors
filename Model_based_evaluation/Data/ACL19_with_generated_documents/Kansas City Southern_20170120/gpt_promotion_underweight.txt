Based on the information from Kansas City Southern's fourth quarter 2016 earnings call, there are several reasons to recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company.

- The adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter decreased by 9% from last year, indicating a decline in profitability.
- Revenues for the quarter were unchanged from last year, and the operating ratio was 64.8%, which was an increase from the previous year.
- Political and economic uncertainty, particularly with regards to the future of NAFTA and trade relationships between the U.S. and Mexico, is a significant concern.
- The weakening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and the increase in Mexican fuel prices could have a negative impact on the company's international business.
- The company's operating performance during the quarter was not up to expectations, with noticeable deterioration in terminal Dwell.

These factors suggest that the company may face challenges in the near future, and there is a need for cautiousness in considering investment in Kansas City Southern. Therefore, based on the recent earnings call, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended for the company.
