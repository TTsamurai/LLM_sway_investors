## Future Investment Outlook Report: Kansas City Southern (KCS) – Underweight Stance

### Executive Summary
Our investment stance on Kansas City Southern (KCS) is recommended as 'Underweight' due to concerns highlighted in the Q4 2016 earnings call, including operational challenges, political and trade uncertainty, and currency fluctuations.

### Financial Performance Overview
During the Q4 2016 earnings call, KCS reported year-over-year flat revenues at $599 million, and a decline of 9% in adjusted diluted EPS to $1.12. The constant revenue amidst substantial challenges is noteworthy; however, concerns stem from various aspects of the company’s operations and external environment. The company's operating ratio deteriorated by 140 basis points to 64.8%.

### Key Challenges and Risks
1. **Operational Inefficiencies**: KCS experienced a noticeable deterioration in operational performance, particularly in terminal dwell times due to new customer facilities lacking sufficient infrastructure. This resulted in severe congestion and operational inefficiencies. Although there is a plan for improvement with infrastructure enhancements forthcoming, the short-term impact may impede operational efficiency and increase costs.
   
2. **Political and Trade Uncertainty**: The political landscape, especially concerning U.S./Mexico trade relations, presents significant risk. The uncertain future of NAFTA and changes in trade policies under the new U.S. administration could substantially affect KCS's cross-border operations, which heavily rely on trade flows between the U.S. and Mexico.

3. **Currency Fluctuations**: The weakening of the Mexican Peso against the U.S. dollar continues to pose a financial risk. Although it has not yet significantly impacted pricing strategy according to the earnings call, continued weakening could eventually strain profit margins, especially in international segments.

4. **Increased Fuel Costs in Mexico**: The notable rise in fuel costs in Mexico, with costs now approximately 70% higher than in the U.S., requires aggressive management of fuel procurement and locomotive strategies to avoid margin erosion. Energy deregulation timelines in Mexico add to this complexity.

### Opportunities
Despite the challenges, there are growth opportunities:
- The anticipated increase in U.S. refiners exporting fuel to Mexico suggests potential for higher shipments of refined products.
- Continued investments in infrastructure to alleviate current operational bottlenecks.
- Long-term positive outlook on cross-border trade, particularly in grain, refined products, and plastics.

### Financial Outlook
While KCS’s short-term outlook is overshadowed by operational, political, and economic uncertainties, management remains optimistic about the company's resilience and strategic initiatives aimed at long-term growth. Revenue stability in the face of challenges shows inherent business strength, but the underperforming indicators, such as diluted EPS and a higher operating ratio, suggest caution.

### Investment Recommendation: Underweight
Given the mix of ongoing operational issues and significant external uncertainties impacting the core operations, we recommend an 'Underweight' investment stance on KCS. Investors should closely monitor the developments in trade agreements, currency stability, and operational efficiency improvements as these elements will be crucial in reassessing potential future positions.

This report advises conservative positioning, considering KCS’s exposure to geopolitical and economic turbulence, while acknowledging the management’s confidence in navigating these challenges. Further investment considerations should align with resolving highlighted risks and capitalizing on outlined opportunities.
