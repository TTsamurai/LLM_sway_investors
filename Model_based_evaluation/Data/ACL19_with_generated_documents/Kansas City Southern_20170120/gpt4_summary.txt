**Kansas City Southern Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call Summary**

**Date:** Fourth Quarter 2016
**Event Type:** Earnings Call

**Financial Highlights:**
- **Adjusted Diluted EPS:** $1.12, a decrease of 9% year-over-year.
- **Revenues:** $599 million, unchanged year-over-year. Adjusted revenue growth was approximately 3% on a constant currency basis, accounting for the depreciation of the Mexican peso.
- **Operating Ratio:** Increased to 64.8% for the quarter (up 120 basis points from last year), and 64.9% for the full year (down 190 basis points from last year). The deterioration in quarterly operating ratio was partly attributed to one-time items from the previous year.

**Operational Insights:**
- The volume remained flat compared to Q4 2015. However, operational challenges were noted, including a noticeable deterioration in terminal Dwell, primarily due to the opening of two large customer facilities in Monterrey-Nuevo Laredo area without adequate track infrastructure leading to congestion.
- Despite growth challenges in certain areas, there was some recovery in market share in the international intermodal business segment and robust performance in maintaining overall portfolio pricing despite the weakened Mexican peso.

**Strategic Developments:**
- Concerns around U.S./Mexico trade relations and the future of NAFTA were highlighted, given the economic and political uncertainties under the new U.S. administration.
- Engagement in the U.S./Mexico CEO Dialogue to potentially influence the trade policy dialogues concerned with NAFTA modernization.
- Increased fuel prices in Mexico and higher diesel costs were noted, with strategies being enacted to manage potential margin erosion through aggressive fuel procurement and locomotive management strategies.
- Optimism was expressed regarding increased U.S. fuel exports to Mexico, anticipated to drive higher shipments of refined products from 2017 onwards.

**Market and Economic Considerations:**
- Cross-border traffic showed that 60% of carloads are southbound, with significant export volumes of grain (notably yellow corn) and emerging opportunities in refined products and plastics.
- The management remains actively engaged with policymakers and stakeholders to navigate through the ongoing changes in trade policies and economic environments.

**Future Outlook:**
- A cautiously optimistic view for 2017 was articulated, expecting the end of successive quarters of revenue declines and projecting a stronger revenue outlook influenced by a stable core pricing strategy.
- The management refrained from issuing specific guidance due to prevailing uncertainties but highlighted an expectation of surpassing the performance of 2016 based on early indications.

**Discussion Points:**
