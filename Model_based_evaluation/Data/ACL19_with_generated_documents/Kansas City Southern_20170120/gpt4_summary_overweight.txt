### Executive Summary: Kansas City Southern Q4 2016 Earnings Call

**Investment Stance:** Overweight

#### Key Financial Metrics:

- **Adjusted Diluted EPS:** There was a decline in adjusted diluted EPS to $1.12, marking a 9% decrease from the previous year.
- **Revenues:** Total quarterly revenues were steady at $599 million. Excluding the impact of the Mexican peso depreciation, revenue would have shown a 3% increase year-over-year.
- **Operating Ratio:** Operating efficiency deteriorated slightly with the operating ratio increasing to 64.8% in Q4 from the previous year, influenced by certain one-time items.
- **Volume and Pricing:** Volume was unchanged from Q4 2015. Core pricing remained robust, with a reported strength of about 3% despite currency and trade concerns.

#### Business Highlights:

1. **Currency and Trade Concerns:**
    - The depreciation of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar has not significantly impacted overall portfolio pricing.
    - The U.S./Mexico trade relations and NAFTA renegotiations represent a significant strategic focus, particularly given the political turnover in the U.S.

2. **Fuel Costs and Operational Efficiency:**
    - Noteworthy increase in Mexican fuel prices and ensuing strategies to manage potential margin erosion. Positive expectations set by U.S. refiners exporting fuel to Mexico, projecting higher shipments starting in 2017.

3. **Operational Challenges:**
    - Experiencing terminal Dwell deterioration, mainly due to new customer facilities starting operations without adequate infrastructure, causing congestion and delays. However, infrastructural adjustments are anticipated to resolve these issues promptly.

4. **Cross-border Traffic and NAFTA Impact:**
    - There is significant involvement in exports, particularly grain and refined products. Any changes in NAFTA could impact the dynamics of these exports, but rational adjustments are expected to potentially strengthen North America's economy.

#### Market and Competitive Landscape:

- The political and economic uncertainties remain at the forefront, especially with respect to trade policies under the new U.S. administration. However, the company remains optimistic about the growth outlook for 2017, emphasizing strong commodity-specific forecasts and potential increases in exports.

#### Strategic Outlook:

- **Investment in Infrastructure:** Continued investment in infrastructure to accommodate growth, especially in the Northern region, is seen as critical to achieving improved operational performance.
- **Engagement in Policy Discussions:** Active involvement in policy discussions through platforms like the U.S./Mexico CEO Dialogue to safeguard and potentially enhance trade frameworks beneficial to KCS and its stakeholders.

#### Conclusion & Recommendation:

Kansas City Southern exhibits resilience in its operational and financial performance despite prevailing macroeconomic uncertainties and currency volatilities. The company's strategic initiatives and engagement in high-level trade discussions position it well to leverage growth opportunities, particularly in cross-border activities. The steady revenue performance, coupled with a robust pricing strategy and infrastructural investments focused on long-term gains, support an 'overweight' investment stance. Investors are encouraged to focus on the companyâ€™s capability to navigate through policy changes effectively and its commitment to operational improvements and strategic growth.
