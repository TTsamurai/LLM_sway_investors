In the recent earnings conference call for Kansas City Southern, the adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.12, a decrease of 9% from last year with revenues remaining unchanged at $599 million. Volumes for the fourth quarter were also unchanged from 2015. Operating ratio for the quarter was 64.8%, 120 basis points higher than last year, and 64.9% for the full-year, 190 basis points lower than last year.

Key financial metrics to consider in adopting an 'underweight' investment stance include the decrease in adjusted diluted EPS, unchanged revenues and volumes, and a higher operating ratio. Additionally, the political and economic uncertainty regarding the U.S./Mexico trade issue, weakening Mexican peso, and increased fuel prices in Mexico pose risks to the company's financial performance.

It is also important to note that the company expressed optimism about growth opportunities in the longer term, particularly in the U.S./Mexico trade relationship and the export-oriented businesses from the U.S. to Mexico. However, the uncertainty surrounding these opportunities and the potential impact of trade negotiations and policy changes could weigh on the company's financial outlook.

In conclusion, given the challenging financial metrics and the uncertainties in the political and economic landscape, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for Kansas City Southern. Further monitoring of the company's performance and developments in trade policies, as well as engagement with policymakers and customers, will be necessary to make informed investment decisions.
