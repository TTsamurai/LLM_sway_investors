Based on the recent earnings call, it is evident that the company's financial performance has been solid. However, there are some concerns that investors should take into consideration. The company's total assets of $2.9 billion are overshadowed by total liabilities of $4.1 billion, which may raise some red flags about the company's financial stability. Additionally, the increase in sales and marketing spending in the fourth quarter may impact the company's profitability. The diluted earnings per share of $0.93 in the third quarter this year compared to $0.90 for the third quarter last year, also indicate a slow growth in earnings. Although cash taxes for the year are expected to be between $20 million and $30 million, there may be uncertainties surrounding the impact of potential changes in tax regulations. Therefore, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company until there is more clarity on its financial stability and potential challenges in the coming quarters.
