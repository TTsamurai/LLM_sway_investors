 for your attention and participation today, everyone. Now, based on the recent earnings call, it is evident that AT&T remains a strong investment opportunity with a positive outlook for the future. The company has shown resilience and adaptability in a rapidly changing market, particularly in response to the reintroduction of unlimited plans by competitors. Despite lower postpaid upgrade rates and pressure in legacy wireline, AT&T has demonstrated cost efficiency and margin expansion, with strong adjusted earnings and cash flows.

The company's strategic moves, such as the acquisition of FiberTower and the FirstNet contract, position it for growth and success in the evolving telecommunications landscape. The expansion of AT&T's fiber network and continued investment in next-generation network technology further solidify its competitive edge.

Additionally, AT&T's international operations, particularly in Latin America and Mexico, are poised for growth and have already demonstrated marked improvements in revenues and margins.

In light of these developments and the overall performance of the company, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on AT&T. The recent earnings call highlights AT&T's strength in the face of competitive pressures and its strategic positioning for future growth. Thank you for your attention, and please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or discussions regarding this recommendation.
