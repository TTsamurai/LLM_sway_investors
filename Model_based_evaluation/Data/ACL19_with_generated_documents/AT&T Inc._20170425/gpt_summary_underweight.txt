to Jennifer's question regarding our competitive position in the fiber market, I believe we have a significant lead due to our extensive fiber investments over the past five years and our large legacy consumer business, which provides us with a substantial footprint. We will continue to invest in fiber and evaluate opportunities to either buy or build. Additionally, with the FirstNet contract award, we have the opportunity to incorporate fiber builds for the nationwide first responder network, further strengthening our lead in the market.

Regarding Simon's question about phone sales, we have observed a change in customer behavior, with slower upgrade rates and customers holding onto their devices for longer periods. This change is likely a result of customers becoming more aware of the costs associated with phone upgrades, as well as the availability of software-enabled capabilities in existing devices. We believe this is a permanent shift in the market, and while we expect upgrade rates to improve with the release of new devices and advancements in network capabilities, we anticipate that upgrade rates will remain lower on a permanent basis.

Overall, our financial results for the quarter indicate strong performance, with adjusted earnings per share of $0.74, an increase in adjusted consolidated margins to 20.7%, and strong cash flows from operations totaling $9.2 billion. Despite pressures on revenues, particularly in the wireless and entertainment segments, we have demonstrated cost efficiencies and strategic moves such as the acquisition of FiberTower, the FirstNet contract, and the intention to acquire Straight Path, which position us for future growth and success.

In conclusion, while the market is undoubtedly competitive, we are confident in our ability to weather the challenges and continue to drive growth and profitability through our strategic initiatives and operational efficiencies. As a financial analyst, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance, taking into consideration the competitive market conditions and the impact on key financial metrics such as upgrade rates and equipment revenues. Thank you for your attention.
