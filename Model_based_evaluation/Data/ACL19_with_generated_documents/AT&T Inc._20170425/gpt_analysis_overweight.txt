Thank you for the information. I will need to analyze the data provided and consider the appropriate financial metrics to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance. This will involve evaluating the company's consolidated revenues, adjusted margins, adjusted earnings, cash flows, capital spending, and free cash flows. In addition, I will need to consider the company's strategic moves, such as the acquisition of FiberTower, the FirstNet contract, and the intention to acquire Straight Path. With all this information, I will prepare a future outlook report for the company.
