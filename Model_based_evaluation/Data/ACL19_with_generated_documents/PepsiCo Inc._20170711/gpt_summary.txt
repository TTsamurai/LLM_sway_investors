The recent earnings conference call highlighted key financial metrics for the second quarter of 2017. The company reported organic revenue growth of more than 3% globally, with developed markets growing by 2% and developing and emerging markets growing by 6%. Core constant currency operating profit grew by 7% and core constant currency EPS grew by 13%.

In North America, organic revenue for Frito-Lay grew and contributed to total U.S. food and beverage retail growth, while North America Beverages also saw organic revenue growth. However, there were limitations in growth rates due to adverse channel and subcategory mix in the quarter.

In Latin America, there were challenging macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical instability, and high levels of inflation in key markets, including Brazil and Argentina. However, Mexico performed well with double-digit organic revenue growth.

In Asia, Middle East, and North Africa, there were macro challenges due to significant currency devaluation in Egypt and economic impact in markets across the Middle East from persistently low oil prices. The company is addressing these challenges by adjusting its business to address cost inflation and carbonated soft drink taxes.

In Europe and Sub-Sahara Africa, the company had very good results with organic revenue growth in each major market and a sequential acceleration overall, with Russia experiencing mid-single-digit organic revenue growth.

The company remains optimistic about its outlook for the balance of the year and is confident in delivering at least 3% organic revenue growth and 8% core constant currency EPS growth for the full year.

The company also discussed industry shifts, including changes in consumer habits, evolving retail formats, and the influence of social and digital media and mobile technology. The company emphasized its strong portfolio, balanced geographic footprint, strong relationships with retail partners, and capabilities in supply chain management, consumer and shopper insight, social and digital consumer engagement, research and development, design, data analytics, and e-commerce.

The company is focused on capturing new avenues of growth and continues to invest in new capabilities to sustain top-line growth globally. It is also focused on innovation and developing new technologies to address the evolving market trends.

In conclusion, the company expressed confidence in its performance and outlined its strategies to navigate through the changing environment and capture new growth opportunities.
