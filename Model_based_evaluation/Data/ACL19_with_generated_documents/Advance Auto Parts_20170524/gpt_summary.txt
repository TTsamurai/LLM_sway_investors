Thank you for the detailed summary. Based on the information provided, here are the key financial metrics:

1. Comp Store Sales Performance: The comp store sales performance was down 2.7% in Q1. This was attributed to planned factors such as the shift of New Year's Day into Q1 and a substantial increase in winter-related demand being pulled forward into December.

2. Sequential Sales Improvement: Despite the decline in comp store sales in Q1, there was positive sequential improvement in sales performance when looking at Q4 and Q1 combined. This demonstrates progress and a positive outlook for future growth.

3. Operating Income: The Q1 operating income results were generally in line with internal expectations, except for larger than anticipated sales softness in February and March. This reflects deliberate investments in customer service and sustained investment despite short-term sales softness.

4. Adjusted Operating Margin Rate: The adjusted operating margin rate was 7.1%, reflecting the impact of productivity agenda and sustained investments in customer service.

5. Adjusted EPS: The adjusted EPS was $1.60, indicating a positive performance with potential for future growth, as productivity initiatives ramp up.

6. Gross Productivity: The company has updated its gross productivity target from $500 million over five years to $750 million over four years, reflecting a significant increase and acceleration.
