. Thank you. I would recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on AAP based on the cautious and skeptical perspective gleaned from the recent earnings call. The company's statements about a decrease in comp store sales, unexpected headwinds in the industry, and a stronger performance towards the end of the quarter could indicate short-term volatility that may not bode well for long-term growth. Additionally, the company's plans for a long-term transformation and productivity agenda may take time to yield substantial results, and the uncertainty surrounding the pacing of investments and the timeline for achieving productivity savings could pose risks for investors. Overall, based on the earnings call, a cautious approach is warranted for investment in AAP.
