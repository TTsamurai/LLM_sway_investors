Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is clear that the company has faced challenges in the first quarter due to unexpected headwinds affecting the entire industry, resulting in a 2.7% decline in comp store sales. The company anticipated these challenges, such as a shift of New Yearâ€™s Day into Q1 and a decrease in winter-related demand. However, the impact of these short-term variables led to a slow start to the spring selling season.

While the operating income results were generally in line with internal expectations, the middle of the quarter experienced larger than anticipated sales softness in February and March. This resulted in a decline in the operating margin due to fixed costs deleverage from the sales decline.

The company's leadership team is in the process of transitioning from Phase 1 to Phase 2 of the transformational journey. Phase 1 focused on refocusing the organization on the customer, developing a clear strategy and leadership team, and making deliberate and sustained investments in availability, customer service, and the front line to drive growth trends. As the company moves into Phase 2, the focus is on elevating customer focus, executing a multi-year productivity plan, and attracting and developing talent throughout the organization.

The company's efforts to invest in the customer are driving real progress, despite the short-term challenges. The goal is to narrow the performance gap versus the industry and achieve above-average sales growth.

Furthermore, the company is aggressively working on a productivity agenda aimed at achieving significant cost savings. The productivity agenda includes zero-based budgeting, supply chain optimization, and reducing material input costs. The company has updated its target to achieve $750 million in gross productivity over four years, reflecting an increase and acceleration in cost-saving measures.

In terms of investment outlook, while the company has faced challenges in the first quarter, there are signs of sequential improvement in sales performance. The company remains confident in its progress and expects sales and customer momentum to continue with more operating leverage as they enter the back half of 2017.

Overall, based on the insights and financial metrics from the earnings call, there are indications of positive progress in the company's transformation efforts and potential for long-term growth. However, given the short-term challenges and the need for significant investment in productivity and customer focus, adopting an 'underweight' investment stance may be appropriate at this time. It is important to monitor the company's performance and its ability to effectively execute its transformation plan before considering a more optimistic investment stance.
