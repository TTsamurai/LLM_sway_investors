Based on the company's recent earnings call, the revenue growth was solid but there are some concerns that should be taken into account. Firstly, the growth in Q4 revenue was primarily driven by a higher-than-expected uptake in holiday season traffic with the Media Solutions and customers. While revenue from the Performance and Security Solutions saw solid growth, the revenue from Media Delivery Solutions saw a decrease, mainly due to a decline in revenue from large Internet Platform Customers.

The company also expects a normal sequential revenue decline for seasonality, perhaps a bit more pronounced in recent years due to the particularly strong media performance in the past quarter. Additionally, the company anticipates further currency headwinds from the strengthening U.S. dollar over the past few months. At current exchange rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q1 revenue, indicating potential challenges in the coming quarter.

Furthermore, the company plans to significantly increase its investment levels in 2017 in new product innovation, service delivery enablement, and platform scaling. As a result, there will be a steady increase in investment throughout the year, leading to a possible impact on profit margins.

While the company has been making investments to capitalize on new opportunities for growth, it's important to be cautious about the potential impact on short-term profitability. The company's long-term prospects for growth seem positive, but the effects of these significant investment strategies are yet to be realized. Therefore, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance based on these factors.
