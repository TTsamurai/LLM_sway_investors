Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tom outlined, Q4 was another strong quarter for Akamai on both the top and bottom lines. However, the data provided in the earnings conference call transcript suggest that there are some concerning financial metrics that could warrant an 'underweight' investment stance for the company.

Q4 revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range at $616 million, up 6% year-over-year or up 7% adjusted for foreign exchange movements. This growth is below the double-digit growth expected for a company of this size. Furthermore, revenue growth continued to be solid across the business with the overachievement versus our guidance driven by a higher-than-expected uptick in holiday season traffic with our Media Solutions and customers, but growth was down 10% year-over-year in the Media Delivery Solutions. The increase in enterprise and carrier division customers' revenue to $15 million is encouraging but not sufficient to make up for the decrease in Media and Web division customers' revenue.

Another concerning financial metric is the decline in cash gross margin to 77%, down 1 point from Q3 levels. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 67%, up 2 points from Q3 levels, consistent with the same period last year and a point higher than our guidance, due to strong revenue achievement. This suggests that the company is not effectively managing its costs, which could impact profitability in the future.

The significant uptick in litigation spend associated with our Limelight patent infringement cases and increased year-end commission costs associated with revenue overachievement led to non-GAAP cash operating expenses exceeding guidance by $23 million from Q3 levels. This raises concerns about the company's ability to control costs and maintain profitability.

Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $247 million, up $9 million from Q3 levels, and $10 million from the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 40%, down 1 point from Q3 levels and from Q4 last year, and in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $174 million, up $10 million from Q3 levels and up $6 million from the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 28%, consistent with Q3 levels, and down 1 point from the same period last year and at the high end of our guidance.

The forecasted sequential revenue decline for seasonality, coupled with the expected further currency headwinds from the strengthening U.S. dollar over the past few months, suggests that the company may struggle to maintain the revenue growth rates observed in 2016. Additionally, the plans to significantly increase investment levels in 2017 in new product innovation, service delivery enablement, and platform scaling, with the expectation of re-accelerating the top-line growth back into double-digit levels in the longer-term, indicate a potentially risky investment strategy, considering the current performance and market conditions.

It is important for investors to consider these key financial metrics as they evaluate their investment stance towards Akamai. An 'underweight' position may be warranted until the company demonstrates stronger revenue growth and improved cost management. In addition, monitoring the company's ability to effectively execute its investment strategy and maintain profitability will be crucial in assessing its long-term prospects.
