The financial analyst would summarize the report by highlighting key financial metrics, such as the strong Q4 revenue of $616 million, indicating a 6% year-over-year growth or 7% adjusted for foreign exchange movements. It is also important to note the revenue growth of 15% excluding six large Internet Platform Customers. Despite Media Delivery Solutions being down 10% year-over-year, the Performance and Security Solutions showed a strong 17% year-over-year growth.

The report should also emphasize the robust growth for Cloud Security Solutions, which achieved a 41% year-over-year revenue growth, resulting in an annualized revenue run rate of over $400 million. Additionally, the report should focus on the strong quarterly performance in Media Division and emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division, showing robust growth of 15% and 26% year-over-year, respectively.

The report should highlight the 77% cash gross margin, consistent with the prior year, and GAAP gross margin of 67%, up 2 points from the Q3 levels. The adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $247 million, up $9 million from Q3 levels. The GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $92 million, while non-GAAP net income was $126 million.

Another key financial metric to emphasize is the free cash flow of $106 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting 24% of revenue. The report should also mention the strong balance sheet, with approximately $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter.

Regarding guidance for the first quarter, the report should highlight the expected revenue range of $596 million to $610 million, noting the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. The report should emphasize the projected EBITDA margins of 39% to 40% for Q1 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.66 to $0.69.

Additionally, the report should mention the planned investment increases in product innovation, service delivery enablement, and platform scaling throughout 2017. These deliberate investment strategies will result in EBITDA margins in the high 30s in 2017 and beyond. The report should emphasize the anticipated increase in CapEx spending, which is expected to return to the long-term model range of 16% to 18% of revenue in 2017.

Overall, the summary report should focus on these key financial metrics, providing a comprehensive overview of the recent earnings conference call transcripts.
