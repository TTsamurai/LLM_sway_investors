Based on the recent earnings call, it is evident that DaVita Medical Group's financial performance is not meeting expectations, particularly in their International business. They reported operating losses in the International segment and revised their adjusted operating income guidance downwards, indicating slower than anticipated growth and acquisition pace. Additionally, the company's cash flow was adversely impacted by the timing of tax payments and an increase in accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO).

Furthermore, despite the strong cash flow, the company plans to use a portion of it for stock repurchases over the coming quarters. This may not be the most prudent use of funds, especially given the challenges they are facing in their International business and the uncertainty surrounding their ability to reach breakeven internationally in 2018.

Additionally, the lack of transparency regarding specific capital allocation in China and the acknowledgment of challenges in entering the market as a multinational corporation raises concerns about their international expansion strategy.

Overall, considering the challenges and uncertainties highlighted in the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on DaVita Medical Group. It is important to approach the company with caution, given the issues they are facing in their International business and their capital deployment strategy.
