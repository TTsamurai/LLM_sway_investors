As a financial analyst, after reviewing the earnings conference call transcript, it is clear that there are several key financial metrics that raise concerns and support an 'underweight' investment stance for DaVita Medical Group (DMG).

Firstly, the adjusted operating income for the second quarter of 2017 was $34 million, which is a significant decrease compared to previous quarters. Additionally, the high amortization load of $44 million, including $7 million related to the acceleration of the branding initiative, impacted the adjusted EBITDA, which was only $94 million for the quarter. This suggests that the company's profitability is under pressure.

In terms of value conversion, the company's plan is on track, with new contracts signed in Colorado and expectations of adding contracts in New Mexico and Washington State by the end of the year. However, the acquisition of new groups in existing geographies seems to be a capital-intensive and low-risk way of acquiring new physicians and patients. It is uncertain if these acquisitions will lead to significant revenue growth in the near term.

Additionally, the International operating losses in the quarter were $13 million, including prior period adjustments and a foreign exchange loss. The change in guidance for the International business, with an adjusted operating income loss in the low $30 millions, raises concerns about the company's ability to expand profitability in international markets.

Furthermore, the timing of cash tax payments and an increase in accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO) adversely impacted the second quarter operating cash flow. While the company generated operating cash flow of $1 billion year-to-date and expects to generate between $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion in 2017, the challenges in the international segment and lower-than-anticipated clinic acquisitions may impact the company's ability to achieve this guidance.

Finally, the company's capital deployment strategy includes using strong consistent cash flow to repurchase stock. While the company repurchased nearly 3.6 million shares in the second quarter, concerns about the company's ability to generate consistent cash flow in the future may impact its ability to continue with stock repurchases.

In conclusion, based on the financial metrics outlined in the earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for DaVita Medical Group. The challenges in international expansion, lower-than-anticipated clinic acquisitions, and the impact on cash flow raise concerns about the company's potential for future growth and profitability.
