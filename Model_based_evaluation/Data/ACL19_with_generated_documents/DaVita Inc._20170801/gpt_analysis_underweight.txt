. Going back to the DaVita Medical Group, the transcript provides insight into the company's financial performance and future outlook. The adjusted operating income for the second quarter of 2017 was $34 million, with a disproportionally high amortization load of $44 million, including accelerated branding initiative costs. This translates to an adjusted EBITDA of $94 million for the quarter. The company's value conversion strategy includes signing contracts in new geographies and tuck-in acquisitions of physician groups, which are considered capital-efficient and low risk.

The guidance for DaVita Medical Group's adjusted operating income for 2017 remains unchanged at $110 million to $150 million, with an estimated $240 million in depreciation and amortization for the year. However, the company expects to be in the bottom half of this range. In the International segment, operating losses for the quarter were $13 million, with a revised adjusted operating income loss forecast in the low $30 millions for the full year, excluding currency and one-time expenses. The company aims to reach breakeven internationally in 2018, depending on acquisition pace.

In terms of cash flow and capital deployment, second quarter operating cash flow was $146 million, impacted by cash tax payments and increased accounts receivable days sales outstanding (DSO). Year-to-date operating cash flow is $1 billion, with guidance for 2017 remaining at $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. The company plans to use its strong cash flow for stock repurchase in the coming quarters.

Additionally, the company is exploring partnerships as an opportunity for entering the Chinese market, considering the challenges of entering as a multinational corporation.

Based on these insights, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for DaVita Medical Group. The company's financial performance and future outlook indicate potential challenges and uncertainties, particularly in the International segment and in entering new markets such as China. The company's guidance for adjusted operating income and the impact of amortization expenses also suggest possible limitations to its profitability. Therefore, it is prudent to approach investment in the company with caution.
