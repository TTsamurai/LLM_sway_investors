Based on the insights and financial metrics provided in the recent earnings conference call transcript, I would recommend adopting an 'overweight' investment stance for DaVita. Here are the key reasons for this recommendation:

1. Strong Adjusted EBITDA: Despite the high amortization load, DaVita Medical Group reported a strong adjusted operating income of $34 million, translating into an adjusted EBITDA of $94 million for the quarter. This indicates the company's ability to generate robust earnings and cash flow from its core operations.

2. Expansion and Value Contracts: The company is actively pursuing growth opportunities through value contracts in new geographies such as Colorado, New Mexico, and Washington State. Additionally, the acquisition of new physician groups in existing geographies is expected to add significant value in terms of providers and patients. This strategic expansion is likely to contribute to the company's future profitability and market share.

3. Capital Deployment and Stock Repurchases: DaVita's strong operating cash flow of $146 million in the second quarter, and a year-to-date operating cash flow of $1 billion, demonstrate the company's financial resilience. The company's plan to use its consistent cash flow to repurchase stock over the coming quarters signals confidence in its long-term growth prospects.

4. International Expansion and Strategy: Although the international operating losses were reported, the company's outlook for reaching breakeven internationally in 2018 is promising. DaVita's strategic approach to entering the Chinese market through partnerships reflects a prudent and calculated expansion strategy.

In conclusion, based on the above analysis, I believe DaVita Medical Group has a strong foundation for future growth and profitability. The company's initiatives to expand its value contracts, control costs, and deploy capital efficiently position it for long-term success. Therefore, an 'overweight' investment stance is warranted for DaVita, with potential upside for investors.
