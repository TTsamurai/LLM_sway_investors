Promising developments in expanding geographic presence, strategic acquisitions, and robust financial management underpin our recommendation to rate DMG as 'overweight'.

**Financial Performance Analysis:**

- **Acquisitions:** The acquisition strategy focusing on 'tuck-in' acquisitions has proved fruitful, with 140 new providers and nearly 200,000 added patients. This capital-efficient method enhances DMG's service capacity and market footprint without exposing the company to substantial financial risks.
