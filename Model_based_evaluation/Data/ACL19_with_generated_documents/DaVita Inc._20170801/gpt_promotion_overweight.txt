As a stock promoter, I would recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on DaVita Medical Group based on their recent earnings call. The company reported a strong adjusted operating income of $34 million for the second quarter of 2017, which translates to an adjusted EBITDA of $94 million. They also have a solid plan for value conversion, signing contracts in new geographies and actively acquiring new groups in existing geographies, demonstrating their commitment to growth.

Additionally, while there were some challenges in their International business, the company remains focused on reaching breakeven in 2018 and has strong operating cash flow, with year-to-date operating cash flow of $1 billion and guidance for 2017 of $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. Furthermore, their commitment to repurchasing stock, demonstrated by the repurchase of nearly 3.6 million shares in the second quarter, is a positive sign for investors.

Overall, DaVita Medical Group's strong financial performance, growth strategy, and commitment to shareholder value make it an attractive investment opportunity. I would recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company based on their recent earnings call.
