 compute. In terms of the amortization expense for LinkedIn, it is a substantial expense that will continue to impact our financials. However, we are confident in our ability to absorb this expense and continue to grow our revenue and operating income. We are making incremental investments in LinkedIn to fuel its continued strong revenue growth and we expect it to be non-dilutive in FY 2018, as it was in Q4.

Overall, we anticipate growth in our commercial cloud business, driven by increasing demand for cloud services and healthy renewals. We are focused on improving our commercial cloud gross margin percentage in each of our cloud services and expect variability in the gross margin due to cloud migrations, deployments, and new scenarios.

At the segment level, we expect growth in our Productivity and Business Processes segment driven by strong performance in our Office commercial and Dynamics business. The Intelligent Cloud segment is expected to continue its growth trajectory, driven by strong demand for Azure and our hybrid cloud offerings. In More Personal Computing, we anticipate growth in our OEM and search revenue, and continued performance in our Surface and gaming business.

In summary, we are pleased with our financial performance in the last quarter and are confident in our outlook for FY 2018. We remain committed to driving revenue growth and improving our financial metrics across all segments. Thank you for your attention and we look forward to your questions.
