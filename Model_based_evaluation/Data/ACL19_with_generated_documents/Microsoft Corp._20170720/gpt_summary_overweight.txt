 compute and storage, and so that’s actually what we are seeing, this is why focusing on that, getting all services better is so important. And maybe, let me even take a step back before that. You know we made a commitment at the beginning of last year, maybe 18 months ago about improving Azure margins over a three-year period. We're right on track. We are right on track, we are doing well, we are seeing the demand signs. So, I think it’s about much more about the direction and the execution rather than sort of just one layer that that’s happening. It’s up of the sum of the parts and each of the parts are doing well, and so does it impact our thinking for the remainder of the year and next and the answer is no. We did see some margin outperformance in each of the cloud services and so the fact that it came through at that time is really responsible for about as much absolute and as much rate of improvement as we’re seeing and so I don't necessarily think this is an exceptional untypical event, I think it’s the next step quarterly progression of what we’ve done, and so it only encourages us for the remainder of the year as well. And with that, maybe just to conclude, we are seeing more strength and signal than expected and I would just reiterate it sort of goes back to execution across all segments. There’s a lot of great opportunity ahead. The momentum continues, and we feel really good about our ability to make progress in the remainders of the year. Thanks.
