compute. And in terms of the impact of LinkedIn on the mix, it doesn't have any direct impact on Azure gross margin, given that it's included in the commercial cloud gross margin percentage. So, I don't see it diluting the Azure gross margin necessarily, but again, I don't think the focus should be on the dilution it’s much more about the improvement across each service and that overall as a result you’d get a better performance on commercial cloud gross margin percentage. And fixed cost leverage will continue to drive overall progress. So, that’s the way to think about it, rather than looking at it at that detailed level. And I think the message we’ve tried to be consistent on is, it actually used to be about the costs and getting leverage from those costs and that continues to be the case, even in the pace of growth that we are showing in some of these services, we believe we’re going to continue to see leverage from that, as well as improvements across each of the services themselves. So, that's the way I’d continue to think about it. When you think about the OpEx and the level of leverage you’re getting, I think Kash, I think we’re getting significant leveraging out of our OpEx spend tied to the revenue growth and margin enhancement in line and it's two-fold. Our cost of revenue is the primary way to really see that performance. You could see that the gross margin in productivity and business processes and even intelligent cloud all improved for the year significantly, and you’ll continue to expect to see progress in each period. So, it's really you could see OpEx growth rates not being up near revenue growth rates. It’s a combination of both. You are right. We continue to invest in LinkedIn to drive revenue growth and drive user engagement. We also continue to focus on our commercial cloud gross margin percentage. And so in the near term of this year you may see them trend in the same direction. But I believe over time as we are able to drive that gross margin improvement up, you will see leverage start to come out of our OpEx as we start to see the costs in the investments we’re making start to stabilize and come down. And so, as we sit here today, I think we are getting the type of leverage we’d expected, the overall spend against the revenue and margin KPIs. And I would say, and I think the management team and I feel very good about the progress we’re making as a result. Just to remind you that, those operating expenses are pretty sizable, and so I take it as the right question. You would expect that each of those services across the commercial business will need continued investment at a pretty good size in terms of order of magnitude. We haven’t specifically called it out, and we do expect that it’d be quite sizable. We’re seeing substantial revenue growth across those. And so if you think about where we’ve been in investments in LinkedIn, in essentially in all three services particularly given where our focus and some of our growth drivers, we think that it’s a revenue mechanism here. The impacts of those investments across all three services will be blended into all three services. And so what we think we need to be stable is as well as even declining our own organic Microsoft expenses, we’ll continue to invest, and we are making incremental investments in LinkedIn to fuel its continued strong revenue growth. When you think about our actual FTR in fiscal year 2018, we are expecting about 3% to 4%. At the same time, we are going to recognize the first full year of operating expenses, including about $620 million of amortization expense. But importantly, we expect that the operating margin on the company level will only decline by about a point.

Analysis:
Based on the transcripts from the company's recent earnings call, it is clear that the company has shown strong financial performance across all segments, with significant growth in revenue, gross margin, and operating income. There are optimistic outlooks for continued growth in cloud revenue, capital investment, and improvements in commercial cloud gross margin percentage.

However, as a stock promoter, it is important to provide a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company's performance. While there has been strong growth in revenue and operating income, it is important to highlight the impact of LinkedIn's operating loss and amortization expenses on the company's overall financial performance. Additionally, the company's forecasted increase in capital investment and operating expenses, driven by continued investments in LinkedIn to fuel its revenue growth, may raise concerns about potential impacts on the company's overall profitability and margin improvement.

Given these factors, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company, as there may be potential risks and challenges to achieving sustained margin improvement and profitability in the near term, particularly due to the significant ongoing investments in LinkedIn and cloud services. It is important to carefully monitor the company's financial performance, especially in relation to the impact of these investments on overall operating margin and profitability.
