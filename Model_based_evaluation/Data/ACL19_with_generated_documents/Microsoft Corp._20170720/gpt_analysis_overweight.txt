 compute and storage. So, I think directional, we will do good on all those fronts and I feel good about it. I think Keith you really nailed it. Our investments are long-term focused. Our commercial bookings numbers excellent, and that is the fuel for that next year. Thank Kas, let me address the amount of LinkedIn amortization and impact on COGS. So we concluded the acquisition in December. Yes, you are right, it is this first full year. In FY 2018, I think we are probably seeing slightly less spend in year one versus year two. It is certainly less than a billion, but more than zero, and I think it likely totals between $450 and $500 million for cash spend related to LinkedIn. Thanks Jonathan, I appreciate the details. And I think the outlook Q1 â€“ so we feel good about Q1 and we feel the guidance provided was in line, and specifically on gross margin there is certainly a lot of debate about the right mix, so how you get that is really correct. So especially with the GDPR coming on, there are going to be a lot of European dynamics that are frankly hard to predict for the year overall. But we feel good heading into Q1. Thanks Brian. So in this quarter we had $387 million of LinkedIn revenue and $220 million of that was from learning. I think we are being, as we typically do in the first year of ownership, conservative about assuming that learning will maintain that track record of growth and that will show up in the portrait when we have the event in August from the new rev rec standards, but it grew 81%, so we are feeling quite good about the Learning business in general, and I would frankly expect and be hopeful that it can maintain and maybe even grow from that 81% rate in FY 2018. And of course, cloud continues to do well and should improve the gross margin mix as that continues to be our growth and improvement rates. So yes, I agree, the acquisition of LinkedIn is a good acquisition. These excellent execution we are seeing in sales and in products, I am really impressed with that, and it's mostly as you see us moving ahead in our cloud standards and software service standards. Satya was right to emphasize Azure as we close the highest number of multi-million-dollar deals to date. And we grew our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate to $18.9 billion this quarter. It is a real strong performance, and we expect the trend to continue, with both usage and premium service adoption driving higher mix for cloud services. So, in conclusion, I am confident in our outlook for the future and I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance for this company. Thank you.
