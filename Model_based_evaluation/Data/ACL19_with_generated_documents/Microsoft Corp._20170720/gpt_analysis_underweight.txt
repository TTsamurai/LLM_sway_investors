 services. And so, I think we focused on and we’ve done that well. And the big thing that we still see in Q4, and that we are really excited about in Q1 and into FY 2018 is the ability to continue to drive that consumption growth and bring people along the path whether it is first to Core then to Standard and then to Premium. I think you should expect to see that pace of improvement per service to be on the slower consistent improvement rate. It’s a slow and steady improvement across all the services, that’s really as gross margin percentage becomes proven out, and it’s really a combination effect as you see in each of the services expand. And maybe the last component, is just, maybe this is to my previous point, which is the most encouraging thing this quarter among other things is the continued improvement in the Azure gross margin dollar itself. That really comes from consumption growth of all of those services and so, in many ways obsessed about the rate and the mix led by what is the highest level mix and then really the mix shift within those specific services. Maybe the other point I should mentioned is, I operationalized this in the revenue plan last year, the planners really thought we could put in place (inaudible) of delivery, fine growth, we did both and we’re really pleased with the results. Thanks Karl. This last quarter was a commercial cloud gross margin dollar improvement across all of services and we did. Thanks Brian. I just want to affirm that our drivers of gross margin increase are each one of our services, and that includes Azure. We focused on and achieved improvement across the board. We are very pleased with that performance. I think the most exciting thing for us is the strong continued momentum in consumption growth across all services, which ultimately leads to improvement in gross margin dollars for each of those services. I think that’s a pretty strong endorsement of our strategy and execution, and we feel very good about that. We continue to have improvements across every service. I don't focus on one or the other and really the most important thing is continued improvement. We’re already seeing significant improvement this year, and we expect a lot of improvement again next year on each of those service lines. We remain confident of the double-digit target we have for that KPI. I think it will be difficult to predict the exact mix of those services and where the improvement might occur, but we’re excited to see that improvement across the board. That’s really the goal, to improve the gross margin for each service and that’s what we’ve done this quarter. Any other feedback on the pace and the momentum from any questions in the room? Thanks Matt. The biggest driver this quarter was definitely strong performance on the renewals in the large markets. In fact, the trends were broadly strongest in the US, Germany and Japan. And of course, agreements do come due at the end of the fiscal year, as we’ve seen this quarter. And so, really it was excellent execution on the renewals and new business. We felt very good about the billings KPI. There was no change in customer contract terms or patterns of invoicing or collections. In fact, our overall billings growth was quite solid and encouraging, especially led by strong performance in Azure and Windows commercial business. And I think the large base significantly contributed to the bookings growth this quarter, and the transition to the cloud continues to drive the renewal mix favorably. We’re starting to see the balance tip in terms of recognized revenue to online versus perpetual, which is a positive trend. Additionally, our security value proposition, Windows E5, did very well and we’ve seen momentum in our midmarket offerings. So, the expiry base provided a strong base of support going into FY 2018, as well as future GAAP reporting numbers. In terms of deals, I think we’ve observed good progress in the larger commercial companies across industries. And so overall, it’s been encouraging to see the strong performance. Was there any other insight I could provide to address your question? Thanks Kash. One thing that really stood out was the excellent execution on large renewals, as well as the encouraging performance on new revenue, particularly in Microsoft Azure and the Windows commercial business. The expiration base certainly contributed to the bookings growth this quarter. In addition, the transition to cloud continues to drive a favorable mix of renewals and the balance of recognized revenue is tipping towards online versus perpetual, which is a very positive trend that we’ve observed. We continue to see good progress with larger commercial business deals across industries, and we’re optimistic about the midmarket offerings. In terms of future trends, we expect the increased demand for cloud services and healthy renewals to continue driving a higher mix of annuity. For next quarter, we anticipate commercial unearned revenue to be strong within the stated range. We expect a more moderate rate of growth in the Office consumer business, and we see Dynamics 365 continuing to drive our cloud mix higher. In the Intelligent Cloud segment, we anticipate another quarter of double-digit revenue growth across server products and cloud services. The More Personal Computing segment, we expect OEM revenue to move closely in line with the PC market. In Devices revenue, we anticipate continued impact from the prior year phone comparisons, and we’ve seen positive signals from customers and partners on our Surface Laptop launch. Overall, I think we feel very good about our future outlook. Thank you for your question. Can I provide any more details or analysis to address your query? Thanks Phil. Let me begin by reaffirming our confidence in achieving the stated goal of $20 billion in commercial cloud ARR. We’ve seen great momentum across all of our services, particularly in Azure and our Windows cloud offerings, which have been driving demand and growth. The strong performance in the large markets, including the US, Germany and Japan, has been a major contributing factor to our excellent return in this quarter, and we’re optimistic about the potential growth in our midmarket offerings. Our successful execution on large renewals and new revenue has been a key driver in our strong performance. In terms of the expiry base, it’s worth noting that we’re starting to see a favorable mix of renewals as we transition to the cloud, and the balance of recognized revenue is tipping towards online versus perpetual, which is a very positive trend. And so we remain confident that we will achieve continued growth and improvement across services, driving higher revenue and gross margin growth. We’re excited about the future and feel encouraged by the positive signals from customers and partners. I hope this provides insight and addresses any further questions you may have. Is there anything else you would like to further discuss or analyze? Thanks Satya. Let me start off by reiterating our commitment to material improvement in commercial cloud gross margin percentage and dollars. Our gross margin percentage for commercial cloud has shown a strong improvement, which is a positive trend that we expect to continue in FY 2018. We anticipate that demand for cloud services will continue to drive a higher annuity mix, and we remain focused on improving our commercial cloud gross margin percentage in each of our cloud services. We're confident that our commercial cloud annualized revenue run rate will continue to exceed expectations, and we’re pleased with the growth in commercial cloud revenue. We anticipate that our capital investment will increase to meet growing demand and capacity needs, leading to variability in our total CapEx spend quarter-to-quarter. Our operating expenses for FY 2018 are expected to grow between 3% and 4%, reflecting the investments we are making to support our top-line growth. Additionally, we are making incremental investments in LinkedIn to fuel its continued strong revenue growth. We expect our company operating margin to only decline by about a point as we continue to grow our cloud revenue and fund new investments to support growth in strategic areas. Excluding the impact of LinkedIn, our operating margin should be flat year-over-year. We anticipate our full-year non-GAAP tax rate to be 23%, plus or minus 2 points, with quarterly variability based on key factors such as cloud revenue mix, geographic mix of revenue, and the timing of equity vests. And finally, we expect LinkedIn, ex-purchase accounting, to be non-dilutive in FY 2018, as it was in Q4. Looking ahead to next quarter, based on current FX rates, we expect less than 1 point of negative impact on revenue growth overall and for each segment. We anticipate strong performance in Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing, and we remain committed to driving continued growth and improvement across all services. I hope this provides a comprehensive overview of our future outlook and stance. Is there any other analysis or details you would like me to address? Thank you for your question.
