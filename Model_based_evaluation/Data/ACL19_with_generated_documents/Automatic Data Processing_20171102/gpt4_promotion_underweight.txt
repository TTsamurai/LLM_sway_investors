Despite ADP’s reported solid performance in the first quarter fiscal 2018, as a stock promoter taking a skeptical perspective, there are several factors that investors need to consider before making an ‘overweight’ investment decision.

**1. New Business Bookings Slowdown**
While ADP has reported a 6% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share, new business bookings have decreased by 3% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Although the company anticipates an acceleration of bookings growth as the year progresses — aiming for a 5% to 7% growth rate — this projection is somewhat speculative, depending heavily on market conditions that are currently influenced by regulatory uncertainties, particularly those following the last U.S. elections. Investors should consider this volatility and regulatory uncertainty as a risk factor, potentially impacting the overall growth trajectory and future profitability of the company.

**2. Client Retention and Migration Costs**
ADP’s client retention has improved, showing a 160 basis point improvement during the quarter which surpassed expectations. The company attributes this to migration of clients to strategic cloud platforms and enhancements in the client service experience. It's important to consider the costs and logistical challenges associated with continual client migrations and platform upgrades, which could impact operational efficiency and short-term profitability. The ongoing need to update and maintain technological infrastructure places a continuous financial burden on the company, which might affect its profit margins.

**3. Dependency on Strategic Investments for Long-term Success**
ADP’s strategy involves significant investment in innovation, in areas such as their next-gen payroll and tax filing engines and low code application development platforms, which might take years to yield tangible returns. These substantial upfront costs with long gestation periods could potentially delay profitability enhancements. While these investments might set the stage for future efficiencies and market leadership, they represent a substantial financial commitment that could impact short-term financial performance.

**4. Acquisition Integration**
The recent acquisition of Global Cash Card is another area where ADP is expanding its capabilities, specifically in digital payments. While this acquisition is aimed at strengthening ADP’s core offering, the integration presents inherent risks and could potentially distract from the company’s primary day-to-day operations. Moreover, as stated, this acquisition currently does not contribute to earnings and poses a nominal drag on profit margins.

**5. Market Reaction to Regulatory Changes**
The business environment for companies like ADP is highly sensitive to regulatory changes, especially concerns regarding health care policies and payroll tax laws. Such sensitivities could pose risks to the business model if swift adaptations are not made. The company has noted a volatile healthcare environment as influencing its Professional Employer Organization (PEO) services margins, a pressure point that could further impact financial stability if not managed carefully.

**Conclusion**
Taking these factors into account, investors should maintain a cautious approach regarding ADP. While the company shows promising areas of growth and solid strategies for future expansion, present uncertainties and ongoing investment for future capabilities create risk elements that could impact expected returns. An ‘underweight’ investment stance is recommended until more clarity and stability are seen in their strategic outcomes and broader market influences.
