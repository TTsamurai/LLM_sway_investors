Key financial metrics from the earnings call include:
- Reported and organic revenue up 6% to $3.1 billion
- Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 6% to $0.91 per share
- New business bookings down 3% compared to the first quarter of 2017.

Overall, the report highlights positive revenue growth, improvements in client retention, and ongoing investment in innovative HCM solutions. However, the decline in new business bookings and regulatory uncertainty post U.S. elections are factors contributing to the 'underweight' investment stance recommendation.
