. Our first quarter results were strong and exceeded our expectations. We reported a 6% growth in revenue to $3.1 billion, driven by organic growth as well as benefits from foreign currency. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share also grew by 6% to $0.91, benefiting from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding.

In terms of new business bookings, we experienced a 3% decline compared to the first quarter of 2017, which was in line with our expectations due to regulatory uncertainty following the U.S. elections. However, we continue to expect gradual expansion back to pre-ACA growth levels as we progress through the fiscal year, with a full year fiscal 2018 new business bookings growth forecasted at 5% to 7%.

Our client retention improved by 160 basis points during the quarter, surpassing our expectations. This improvement was driven by continued efforts to upgrade clients to strategic cloud platforms and investments in improving the client service experience.

We have made significant progress with our Service Alignment Initiative, rationalizing our footprint by exiting nine subscale facilities this quarter. This has resulted in a 63% closure of our total planned exits in just over one year.

Our innovations in HCM continue to be recognized in the industry, with ADP's Workforce Now solution ranked number one in satisfaction for payroll and HR management suites in the fall mid-market grid report by G2 Crowd. We also received awards for our Compass Solution and Pay Equity Explore Solution at the HR Technology Conference.

We are excited about the future and our next generation of client-centered innovation, including a low code application development platform, next-gen payroll and tax filing engines, and a proprietary digital payments processing platform following the acquisition of Global Cash Card.

In conclusion, ADP's solid first quarter results reflect the enduring qualities of the company, including a culture focused on delivering a great client experience through best-in-class technology and service. We are committed to advancing our strategy and delivering on our commitments to all stakeholders, including clients, shareholders, and associates.

Thank you for your interest in ADP. We look forward to continued success and growth in the years ahead.
