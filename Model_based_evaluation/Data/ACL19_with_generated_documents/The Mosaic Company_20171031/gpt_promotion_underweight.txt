Based on the recent earnings call from the company, there are several cautionary points to consider before making an investment. Firstly, the impact of Hurricane Irma on the phosphate operations resulted in significant loss of sales and affected the overall gross margin rate of the business unit for the quarter. The cost impact from the hurricane in September was approximately $35 million, resulting in a decreased gross margin rate to 9% for the quarter.

Additionally, the ammonia supply contract with CF Industries is currently underwater due to the current market price of natural gas. The company expects to pay approximately $330 per tonne FOB Louisiana, leading to further negative impact on gross margins. While the contract is intended to generate shared producer economics over time, the current situation poses a financial challenge.

The company also emphasizes the underperformance of Vale Fertilizantes for the first nine months of 2017, attributing it to various factors such as major movement in the Brazilian reais, flooding at Miski Mayo, plant fires at Uberaba, and operational costs that have been higher than usual. The unpredictability and volatility of the fertilizer industry add further uncertainty to the company's future earnings potential.

Despite strategic moves to improve cash flow and reduce leverage, the challenges mentioned raise concerns about the company's financial performance. Therefore, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance based on the company's recent earnings call and the cautious outlook presented.
