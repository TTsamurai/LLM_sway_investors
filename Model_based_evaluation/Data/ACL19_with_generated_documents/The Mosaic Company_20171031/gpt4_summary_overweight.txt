### Summary Report: Mosaic Earnings Conference Call

**Presenter:** Adam (CEO), Joc, Vincent, and other executives.

### Key Financial Metrics and Highlights:

- **Phosphate Segment**:
  - Despite Hurricane Irma, which caused production losses and damaged product equivalent to 220,000 tonnes of lost sales, the Phosphate segment demonstrated significant resilience.
  - Prior to the hurricane, the segment achieved a gross margin rate of 12%. Post-hurricane impact reduced the Q3 margin rate to 9%.
  - Expected Q4 shipments range between 2.3 million to 2.6 million tonnes with prices between $320 to $350 per tonne.
  - MicroEssentials product sales are projected to hit a record ~3 million tonnes for the year.

- **Ammonia Supply and Costs**:
  - A supply contract with CF Industries is in place, expecting to pay approximately $330 per tonne for about 200,000 tonnes of ammonia in Q4.
  - The supply contract, while currently 'underwater', aims to stabilize long-term producer economics and guard against nitrogen price volatility.

- **Potash Segment**:
  - Demonstrated strong margins and is effectively managing costs to improve price realization.
  - Gross margin rate for the quarter stood at 21%.
  - Expected Q4 sales volumes are between 1.9 million to 2.2 million tonnes at prices ranging from $175 to $195 per tonne.
  - MOP cash cost per tonne was reported at $101, including expenses related to royalty and brine management.

- **International Distribution Segment**:
  - Achieved volumes and margins at or above the upper bounds of guidance during the peak season in Brazil.
  - Expectations for Q4 align with typical seasonal patterns, with anticipated sales volumes between 1.5 million to 1.8 million tonnes and a gross margin per tonne of approximately $20.

- **Cost Management Initiatives**:
  - Reductions in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and brine management costs are expected.
  - Successful cost savings initiatives in the phosphate segment will be mirrored in the potash operations.

### Strategic Moves and Future Outlook:
- **Vale Fertilizantes Acquisition**:
  - Historical underperformance acknowledged, with a strong focus on integration and operational improvements to recover and enhance the financial metrics.
  - Targeted cost savings of $275 million by 2020 via operational efficiencies and synergies in purchasing and production.

- **Lease Finance Transaction**:
  - Following a lease finance strategy, the company realized a cash benefit of approximately $200 million post-quarter.

- **Operational Challenges and Mitigation**:
  - Ongoing resolution of challenges such as the impacts from Hurricane Irma, with efforts towards recovery and normalization.
  - Special charges including a $10 million adjustment related to Canadian royalty disputes, providing a net cash positive impact after accounting for refunds.

### Recommendation:
- **Investment Stance: Overweight**
  - Recommended overweight position based on the company's robust recovery and risk management measures post-Hurricane Irma, strategic acquisitions aimed at improving long-term operational efficiency, and substantial cost management efforts across segments.
  - These strategic measures, combined with expected improvements in global commodity prices and strong demand across key segments, suggest potential for attractive returns, supporting an overweight investment stance.

This report emphasizes Mosaicâ€™s strong financial and operational resilience amidst challenges, highlighting strategic initiatives that are likely to yield significant financial and operational benefits.
