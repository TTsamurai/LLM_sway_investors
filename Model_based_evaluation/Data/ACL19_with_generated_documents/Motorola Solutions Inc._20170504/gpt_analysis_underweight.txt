Based on the insights and financial metrics derived from the recent earnings conference call transcript, there are several reasons to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. 

Firstly, the revenue growth of 7% from last year is primarily driven by the inclusion of Airwave revenue, which grew 3% excluding Airwave. However, the Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, down $156 million from last year, due to a reduction of Airwave backlog over the past 12 months. While there was sequential backlog growth, it is important to consider the decreasing services backlog as a potential risk factor.

Secondly, the non-GAAP EPS was $0.71 versus $0.52 in the year-ago quarter, a 37% year-over-year increase. However, the impact of the acquisition of Interexport is approximately $0.03 for 2017, which indicates a potential slowdown in EPS growth.

Additionally, while there was a significant increase in operating cash flow and free cash flow compared to last year, it was largely driven by higher earnings and a legal settlement. It is important to consider the sustainability of such cash flow growth.

Furthermore, the company expects Q2 sales to be up 2% to 3%, including approximately $25 million of FX headwind, primarily driven by the British pound. This indicates a potential headwind in future sales growth.

Lastly, while the company made significant announcements and acquisitions in both the product and services segments, it is important to closely monitor the impact of these strategic moves on the overall financial performance.

Overall, considering the potential impact of decreasing services backlog, acquisition impact on EPS, foreign exchange headwinds, and the sustainability of cash flow growth, it would be prudent to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company based on the recent earnings conference call transcript.
