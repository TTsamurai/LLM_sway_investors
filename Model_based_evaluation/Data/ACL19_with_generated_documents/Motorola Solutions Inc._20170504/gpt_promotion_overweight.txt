Based on the company's recent earnings call, there are several compelling reasons to recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. 

First, the company's Q1 results show significant growth in revenue, with a 7% increase from last year, and a 3% increase excluding Airwave. This growth in revenue has also resulted in a substantial increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP operating earnings, with a 76% and 360 basis points increase, respectively.

Furthermore, the company's earnings per share have also seen a significant increase, with a 37% year-over-year increase in non-GAAP EPS. This indicates strong profitability for the company.

Additionally, the company's backlog has seen an increase, with product backlog up $285 million and services backlog up $61 million sequentially. This demonstrates a strong demand for the company's products and services.

The company's outlook for the remainder of the year is also positive, with expectations of sales to be up 2-3%, and a non-GAAP EPS range between $0.98 and $1.03 for Q2. The full-year sales are expected to be at the high end of the prior range, and the non-GAAP EPS is raised to be in the range of $5.08 to $5.23. These projections indicate strong growth and profitability for the company in the coming year.

Furthermore, the company's regional results show growth in America's revenue, a 27% increase in EMEA revenue, and a strong demand for the company's solutions in Asia Pac, particularly in Australia.

The company's recent product and services segment highlights, such as the launch of WAVE OnCloud and the acquisition of Kodiak Networks, also demonstrate the company's commitment to innovation and expansion, which is likely to drive future growth and profitability.

Overall, based on the strong Q1 results, positive outlook, and notable segment highlights, an 'overweight' investment stance on the company is recommended. The company's strong financial performance, positive outlook, and strategic initiatives make it an attractive investment opportunity.
