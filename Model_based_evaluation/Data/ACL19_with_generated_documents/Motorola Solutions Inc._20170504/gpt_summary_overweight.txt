Based on the Q1 earnings call transcript, it is evident that the company has shown strong financial performance, with revenue growth of 7%, excluding Airwave. GAAP operating earnings increased by 76%, and non-GAAP operating earnings also saw a significant increase of 360 basis points from the previous year. Both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) also showed positive growth.

The financial metrics for product sales and services revenue have demonstrated positive growth, with product segment backlog increasing by 22% and services backlog down by $156 million due to the reduction of Airwave backlog.
