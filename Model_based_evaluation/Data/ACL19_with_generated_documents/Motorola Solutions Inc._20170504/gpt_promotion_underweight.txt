There are several red flags in the recent earnings call that indicate potential concerns for investing in this company. The decrease in services backlog, driven by a reduction in Airwave backlog, is a warning sign of declining demand for the company's services. Additionally, while revenue and earnings per share have increased, it is important to note that these numbers are heavily influenced by the inclusion of Airwave revenue, which may not be sustainable in the long term. The company's reliance on large projects, such as LA-RICS and NÃ¸dnett in Norway, for revenue growth raises concerns about the sustainability of its product segment and margins. Finally, the lack of forward guidance on integration services and minimal commentary on systems integration raises questions about potential challenges in these areas. Taking these factors into consideration, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company until these concerns are addressed and the company's performance stabilizes.
