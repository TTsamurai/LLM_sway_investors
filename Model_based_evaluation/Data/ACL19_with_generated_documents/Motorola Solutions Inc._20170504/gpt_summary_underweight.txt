In analyzing the Q1 earnings conference call transcript, it is clear that the company has seen a significant increase in revenue, operating earnings, and backlog. However, there are several key financial metrics that indicate a potential for a decline in investment value, leading to an 'underweight' investment stance.

First, the decrease in Services backlog by $156 million, largely driven by the reduction of Airwave backlog, is concerning. While the company has experienced growth in Services revenue, excluding Airwave, it is important to note that the overall backlog has decreased, indicating a potential slowdown in future revenue generation.

Additionally, while the increase in GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations is substantial at $0.45 compared to $0.10 in the first quarter of 2016, the non-GAAP EPS increase of 37% year-over-year is lower than expected, considering the significant growth in revenue and operating earnings.

Furthermore, the dependence on non-GAAP financial results for outlook and financial metrics raises questions about the sustainability of the company's performance. The fact that the company expects sales to be up only 2% to 3% in Q2, with an FX headwind of approximately $25 million, indicates a potential plateau in revenue growth.

Moreover, the increase in net debt to $3.6 billion, coupled with the repurchase of $178 million of stock and dividend payments of $77 million, signals a potential strain on the company's financial position and cash flow.

Overall, while the company has shown strong performance in certain segments, such as the launch of new products and significant deals in the Services segment, the decrease in backlog, potential revenue headwinds, and debt burden warrant an 'underweight' investment stance. Further analysis and monitoring of the company's financial performance and strategic initiatives are recommended before considering an investment in the company.
