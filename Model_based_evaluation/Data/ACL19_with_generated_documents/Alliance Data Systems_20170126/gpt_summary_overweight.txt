Based on the conference call transcript, here are the key financial metrics that support an 'overweight' investment stance for LoyaltyOne and Alliance Data:

1. Pro forma revenue of $7.4 billion, up 15% from 2015. Adjusted for noise and pull forward of revenue recognition, revenue was approximately $7.2 billion, up 12% and consistent with guidance.
2. Core EPS was $16.92, up 12% from 2015 and $0.02 better than guidance.
3. Revenue and adjusted EBITDA for LoyaltyOne both increased about 4% for 2016.
4. BrandLoyalty experienced high single-digit growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA with expansion efforts in Canada exceeding expectations.
5. Epsilon's revenue increased 1% while adjusted EBITDA decreased 6%, but the company has significantly lowered its expense base, which could make it more price-competitive on certain product offerings going forward.
6. Card services saw 24% growth in revenue and 14% growth in adjusted EBITDA, with credit sales increasing 16% for the fourth quarter and 18% for the year.

Overall, these financial metrics show solid revenue and earnings growth for LoyaltyOne and Alliance Data in 2016, with potential for further growth in 2017. The strategic efforts in expanding offerings in Canada and potential growth drivers in the U.S. market for LoyaltyOne, as well as stabilization of yields and improving operating leverage for card services, support an 'overweight' stance on investment in these companies.
