### Underweight Investment Stance Report on Alliance Data Systems Corporation

#### Introduction
Despite the upbeat tone presented in the recent earnings call by Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS), there remain several underlying concerns that suggest a more cautious approach to investment in ADS stocks. This report aims to highlight key areas of concern from the latest financial data and strategic moves as presented by the management during the call, supporting an 'underweight' investment recommendation.

#### Concerns Based on the Earnings Call Analysis

1. **Revenue Recognition Acceleration**: The significant pull forward in revenue recognition due to elevated redemption activity in Q4 2016 (approximately $175 million) is not expected to recur. This one-time boost, primarily influenced by expiring AIR MILES and subsequent heavy media attention, artificially inflated the revenue figures for 2016. Projected back to a normalized status, the figures suggest a potentially overstated financial strength teetering on unique, non-recurring circumstances.

2. **Adjustments in Core EPS**: The management highlighted the adjustments made to core EPS, accounting for the $242 million related to loyalty point expiry removal. This one-time adjustment helped improve the EPS figures but does not necessarily reflect an operational strength, raising concerns about the EPS quality and sustainability moving forward.

3. **Underperformance at Epsilon**: Epsilon’s disappointing performance with just 1% revenue growth and a 6% decline in adjusted EBITDA is particularly concerning given its role in the data-driven marketing solutions segment of ADS. Notably, Epsilon faced challenges in its technology platform with client attrition and key non-core offering issues. This underperformance might signal deeper issues in operational execution and market competitiveness.

4. **Credit Quality and Loan Performance**: The slow growth in receivables towards the year-end 2016 and a higher principal loss rate of 5.1% (up slightly from guidance) points to potential headwinds in the card services segment. Although defaults are in line with delinquency expectations, any downturn in consumer credit quality could pose significant risks, given that card services showed considerable gains.

5. **Strategic Directions and M&A Potential**: Management’s commentary about the lack of pressing M&A opportunities and focus on share repurchases might indicate fewer avenues for aggressive growth or diversification in the near future. This strategic stance, while prudent in terms of capital return, could limit ADS’s ability to swiftly adapt or scale in competitive markets.

6. **Long-term Sustainability Concerns**: Adjustments due to legislative changes in the AIR MILES program and the one-time reset in the breakage rate highlight vulnerabilities in ADS’s business model to external regulatory and market pressures, impacting long-term sustainability and predictability of earnings.

#### Conclusion and Recommendations
While the management of Alliance Data Systems Corporation endeavors to position the company for solid performance and stability, the reliance on one-time adjustments, underperformance in key business segments, and potential market and regulatory vulnerabilities suggest a prudent approach to investment.

Investors should view ADS with caution, considering an 'underweight' stance until clearer signs of sustainable operational improvements and growth trajectories are evident. In the interim, focus should be on keen observation of Epsilon's recovery, stabilization of revenue without one-time boosts, and the company’s strategic adaptations to market and regulatory changes.
