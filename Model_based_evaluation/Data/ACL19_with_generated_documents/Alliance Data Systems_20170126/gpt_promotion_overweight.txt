Based on the recent earnings call, it is clear that Alliance Data had a noisy fourth quarter due to expiry, but despite this, the company had a terrific 2016. Pro forma revenue increased by 15% from 2015, with core EPS also increasing by 12%. LoyaltyOne and BrandLoyalty had strong performances, and despite challenges, Epsilon is expected to be more price-competitive in the future due to a lower expense base. Card services also had an excellent year, with 24% growth in revenue and 14% growth in adjusted EBITDA. The company plans to prioritize a $500 million share repurchase plan and expects free cash flow to increase by 7-10% in 2017. Additionally, the company is confident in its portfolio and vintage performance and expects to fully normalize within the next six months. Based on these positive metrics, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Alliance Data.
