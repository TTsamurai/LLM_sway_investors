Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, there are several key insights and financial metrics to consider when preparing a future outlook report for the company. However, it is important to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance due to certain factors:

1. Noise in Q4: The company's LoyaltyOne and Alliance Data experienced a noisy fourth quarter due to expiry and heavy media attention to the issue. This could potentially impact future revenue recognition and create uncertainty.

2. Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA Growth: Despite the noise in Q4, the pro forma revenue for 2016 was $7.4 billion, up 15% from 2015. Adjusted EBITDA for LoyaltyOne increased about 4% for 2016. However, it's important to note that these figures are adjusted for the noise in Q4.

3. BrandLoyalty Growth: LoyaltyOne's BrandLoyalty had a terrific year with high single-digit growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA, but there are concerns about the U.S. market and early successes driving growth in 2017.

4. Epsilon's Disappointing Year: Epsilon's revenue only increased 1% while adjusted EBITDA decreased 6% in 2016. There were issues with technology platform growth and non-core offerings, which could continue to impact future performance.

5. Card Services Performance: Card services had a stellar year with 24% growth in revenue and 14% growth in adjusted EBITDA. However, there are concerns about declining comparable sales growth and the impact on gross yields.

6. Free Cash Flow and Share Repurchase: The company anticipates free cash flow to be up 7% to 10% in 2017 over 2016, and plans to prioritize a $500 million authorized share repurchase plan.

While there are positive aspects to the company's performance, the noise in Q4, disappointing performance from Epsilon, and potential challenges in certain markets could justify an 'underweight' investment stance. It is important to carefully monitor the company's future performance and the impact of the noise in Q4 on revenue recognition before making any investment decisions.
