Based on the recent earnings call, it is clear that LoyaltyOne and Alliance Data had a noisy fourth quarter, with expiration issues causing elevated redemption activity. This pull forward of revenue recognition to 2016 creates a skeptical view of the company's performance. Additionally, Epsilon had a disappointing year with lower than expected revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth, mainly due to issues with technology platform growth and non-core offerings. The stability of yields and the decrease in core spending also raise caution regarding the company's future performance.

Furthermore, the uncertainties surrounding the breakage rate for the AIR MILES Dream program and the normalization of credit card portfolios suggest that the company may face challenges in the near future. Given the mixed performance and uncertainties highlighted in the earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company.
