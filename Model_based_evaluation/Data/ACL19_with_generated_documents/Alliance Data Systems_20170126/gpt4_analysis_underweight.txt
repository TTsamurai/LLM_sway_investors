**Company: Alliance Data**

**Future Outlook Report: Underweight Investment Stance**

**1. Financial Performance Summary:**
Alliance Data experienced mixed results across its various divisions during 2016. While some segments like Card Services showed robust growth, others like Epsilon and LoyaltyOne faced significant challenges, impacting overall company performance.

- **Revenue**: Pro forma revenue was reported at $7.4 billion, a 15% increase from 2015. However, this figure includes approximately $175 million revenue from elevated Q4 redemption activity, which does not reflect underlying business strength.

- **Core EPS**: Increased to $16.92, showing a 12% rise from 2015. Adjustments were made due to a one-time impact resulting from new legislation in Ontario affecting the AIR MILES program.

- **Adjusted EBITDA**: Disparate performance across divisions, with Epsilon’s adjusted EBITDA declining by 6% and Card Services showing growth.

**2. Division Analysis:**
- **Card Services**: Exhibited strong growth with 24% revenue growth and a 14% increase in adjusted EBITDA. However, there is growing concern over slowing receivables growth and a marginal increase in principal loss rates. 
- **Epsilon**: A disappointing year with only a 1% increase in revenue and a 6% decrease in adjusted EBITDA. Notable weaknesses in technology platforms and the old-value click business transitioning to data-driven solutions.
- **LoyaltyOne**: Mixed results driven by turbulence in the AIR MILES program, including reduced issuance growth and legislative challenges in Ontario.

**3. Risk Factors:**
- **Legislative Impact**: Changes in laws affecting the AIR MILES program led to unforeseen shifts in consumer behavior and financial adjustments, signaling potential volatility ahead.
- **Operational Inefficiencies**: Epsilon’s struggle to pivot its business model and declining EBITDA poses significant concerns about its ability to adapt to market changes.
- **Credit Market Sensitivity**: Increasing principal loss rates and the normalization of credit quality could impact profitability, especially in the volatile consumer credit environment.

**4. Investment Considerations:**
- **Competitive and Regulatory Environment**: Heightened sensitivity to legislative changes and competitive pressures could disrupt profitability.
- **Innovation and Market Adaptation**: Need for significant improvements in Epsilon and consistent innovation to meet changing consumer and sponsor demands.
- **Financial Health**: Albeit growth in certain areas, the diversification of growth quality and sustainability of earnings is a concern, necessitating careful monitoring of financial health.

**5. Shareholder Return Prospects:**
- **Dividend and Buybacks**: The company has authorized a substantial share repurchase plan valued at $500 million. While this supports shareholder returns in the short-term, long-term value creation is contingent upon resolving operational weaknesses.
- **Investor Confidence**: Current strategies and the recalibration of business segments must be closely watched to ensure they align with creating shareholder value, given the ongoing operational challenges.

**6. Conclusion and Recommendation:**
Given the current mixed financial health and operational issues faced by Alliance Data, as well as uncertainties around legislative impacts and market conditions, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended. The company needs to demonstrate consistent improvement in operational efficiency and financial robustness across all segments before a reconsideration of this stance is warranted. Investors should maintain vigilance over quarterly performance updates, changes in consumer credit markets, and legislative environments to adjust their investment strategies accordingly.
