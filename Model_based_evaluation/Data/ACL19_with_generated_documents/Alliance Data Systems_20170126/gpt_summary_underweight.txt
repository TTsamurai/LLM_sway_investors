Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is clear that there were several factors that contributed to the financial performance of LoyaltyOne and Alliance Data during the fourth quarter of 2016. While the overall revenue increased by 15% to $7.4 billion, it is important to note that this growth was attributed to elevated redemption activity, primarily due to the expiry of AIR MILES. Adjusted for these one-time factors, revenue was approximately $7.2 billion, showing a 12% growth, which was consistent with guidance. 

However, it is important to highlight the disappointing performance of Epsilon, where revenue only increased by 1% and adjusted EBITDA decreased by 6%, significantly below the 5% growth expectations for 2016. The decline in revenue was driven by a negative growth rate in the technology platform and non-core offerings.

On the topic of card services, while there was a 24% growth in revenue and 14% growth in adjusted EBITDA, it is important to note that there was a marginal increase in the principal loss rate at 5.1% for 2016, just slightly higher than original guidance. This suggests potential concerns regarding credit quality.

Additionally, it is worth mentioning that the management's perspective on M&A opportunities for 2017 is not very optimistic, and the primary focus seems to be on share repurchase plans. While this is a good strategy for returning cash to shareholders, it may indicate a lack of growth opportunities for the company.

Overall, the underperformance of Epsilon, concerns about credit quality in card services, and a lack of growth opportunities through M&A could indicate lower future growth prospects for LoyaltyOne and Alliance Data. Therefore, adopting an 'underweight' investment stance would be advisable at this time.
