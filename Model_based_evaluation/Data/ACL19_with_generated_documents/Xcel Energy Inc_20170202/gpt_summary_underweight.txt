. Thank you for providing the call transcript. After reviewing the financial metrics and key details, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance for the following reasons:

1. While the company reported ongoing EPS growth of 5.7% in 2016, the performance in recent years has not shown significant progression. This indicates a lack of strong momentum in earnings growth.

2. The increase in dividend by 6.3% is noteworthy; however, the ability to sustain and further grow dividends could be impacted by lower authorized ROEs and potential legislative changes.

3. The company's renewable energy strategy, although promising, entails significant capital investment, with a cost of approximately $3.5 billion over the next five years. This raises concerns about balance sheet strength and potential impacts on future cash flows.

4. The ongoing storm-related challenges in the company's service territories highlight operational risks that could impact reliability and customer satisfaction.

5. The uncertainty surrounding the legislative approval of a natural gas combined-cycle power plant at the Sherco site poses regulatory risk and potential delays in new generation projects, impacting future growth prospects.

6. The discussions around potential tax reforms and their potential impact on the industry create additional uncertainty and could result in changes to the company's financial outlook.

7. The company's cautious approach to capital expenditure and the potential impact on future rate increases may limit the pace of growth and shareholder returns.

Given these factors and the potential risks and uncertainties, an 'underweight' investment stance is advised to reflect a cautious approach to the company's financial performance and outlook. Further monitoring of regulatory and legislative developments, as well as operational progress, is recommended to reassess the investment stance in the future.
