Based on the recent earnings call, it seems that the company had a strong year financially, strategically, and operationally in 2016. They met or exceeded their earnings guidance for the 12th consecutive year and raised their dividend for the 13th straight year. They also introduced a steel-for-fuel strategy to invest in renewable generation and have various wind projects in the pipeline. However, despite the positive financial results, the company's ROE did not make a lot of progress over the previous year due to lower authorized ROEs. Additionally, there are uncertainties around legislative approvals for building a natural gas combined-cycle power plant and plans for future investments post-2021. The company also mentioned potential disruption in the industry due to tax reform and emphasized that there is a long way to go with tax reform. Overall, while the company has strong financial and operational results, there are uncertainties around regulatory approvals and potential disruptions from tax reform, which may warrant a cautious or skeptical perspective on the investment potential of the company. Therefore, it may be recommended to maintain an 'underweight' investment stance at this time.
