Based on the company's recent earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that the company had a strong year financially, with ongoing EPS of $2.21 in 2016, representing a growth rate of 5.7%. The company also raised its dividend by 6.3% to $1.36 per share, continuing a trend of increasing dividends over the years. Strategy-wise, the company introduced a steel-for-fuel strategy, planning to invest about $3.5 billion in renewables over the next five years. This includes ongoing projects such as the Colorado 600 megawatt Rush Creek wind project and seeking to add 1,500 megawatts of new wind generation in Minnesota.

In terms of operations, the company successfully completed the construction of a 200-megawatt wind farm in North Dakota and demonstrated efficiency in responding to customer outages during storms in their service territories. Furthermore, the company is seeking to build a natural gas combined-cycle power plant at the Sherco site in Minnesota, which is pending approval.

From a financial perspective, the company's Return on Equity (ROE) did not make significant progress due to lower authorized ROEs in 2016. However, the company aims to close this gap through entering into multiyear plans in Minnesota and Colorado, combined with cost initiatives.

Overall, the company's focus on renewables and grid investments is expected to lead to rate base growth of approximately 5% and a long-term trend of 0 to 0.5% customer growth. The company emphasizes a pragmatic approach to carbon reduction and economic development, which aligns with the proposed legislation and regulatory updates in various states.

While the company shows positive financial and operational performance, as a financial analyst adopting an 'underweight' investment stance, caution is warranted due to the uncertainty surrounding tax reform, potential disruptive nature of transition rules, and the need for bipartisanship in the legislative process. Furthermore, the company's plan to invest significant capital in renewable projects and grid initiatives post-2021 could pose financial and execution risks.

In conclusion, while the company's strategic initiatives and operational efficiency are commendable, the potential regulatory and economic uncertainties suggest an 'underweight' investment stance at this time. Continued monitoring of legislative developments, regulatory approvals, and financial performance will be necessary to reassess the investment stance in the future.
