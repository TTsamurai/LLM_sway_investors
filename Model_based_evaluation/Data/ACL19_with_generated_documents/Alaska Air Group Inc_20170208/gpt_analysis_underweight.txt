Based on the insights and financial metrics from the recent earnings conference call transcript, I would recommend adopting an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. Here are the key reasons:

1. Profit Margins: The company's profit margins are affected by the acquisition of Virgin America. While it added approximately $15 million to net profit in the fourth quarter, the impact on the company's overall margin is unclear. Virgin America ran at a much lower margin than Alaska, and the combined result may lead to a margin in between the two.

2. Cost Pressure: The company is facing cost pressure in 2017, including higher fuel costs, new engine services agreements, and higher pension expenses. These factors could potentially impact the company's bottom line and earnings per share.

3. Capital Expenditure: The company has a busy year with capital expenditure, including investments in aircraft, facilities, and other non-aircraft related projects. This could impact free cash flow and strain the company's financial position.

4. Debt and Leverage: The company ended the year with long-term debt of $2.6 billion, with most of it being acquisition debt. The adjusted debt-to-cap stands at 59%, which is higher than the target of about 40% debt to cap. Although the company is committed to re-deleveraging, its current debt level indicates potential financial risk.

5. Limited Cash Distributions: The company indicated that cash distributions to shareholders would be limited to the dividend and modest opportunistic share buybacks. This could impact shareholder returns and investor confidence.

Based on these factors, it is prudent to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company, considering the uncertainties surrounding profit margins, cost pressures, capital expenditure, debt levels, and limited cash distributions. It is important to closely monitor the company's financial performance and future guidance before considering an overweight investment stance.
