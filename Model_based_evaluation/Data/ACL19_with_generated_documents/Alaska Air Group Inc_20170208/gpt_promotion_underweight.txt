Thank you, Andrew and Lavanya, for the detailed update on the company's recent earnings. As a stock promoter, I have to take a cautious or skeptical stance based on the information provided. While the company reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter and full year, including consecutive annual profits and improved earnings per share, there are several factors that raise concerns.

First, the acquisition of Virgin America has added significant capital to the company's balance sheet, which will impact the return on invested capital (ROIC) over the next year. The gradual fall in ROIC and the muddy year-over-year comparisons in financial guidance raise uncertainty about the company's future performance.

Additionally, the increase in economic fuel costs per gallon for the first time in several years, along with potential cost pressures such as higher pension expenses and new engine services agreements, could hinder profit margins in the coming year. The company's substantial CapEx plan for fleet expansion and facility investments further raises questions about cash flow allocation and potential impacts on shareholder returns.

Moreover, the complex reporting and guidance structure for the combined Alaska and Virgin America operations may make it difficult for investors to fully understand and evaluate the financial performance of the merged entities. There are also concerns about the profitability of the premium class offerings and the potential dilution of margins resulting from the acquisition of Virgin America.

In conclusion, while the company's strong financial discipline and track record of profitability are commendable, the uncertainties surrounding the acquisition and integration of Virgin America, as well as potential cost pressures, lead me to recommend an 'underweight' investment stance. It's advisable for investors to closely monitor the company's performance and seek further clarity on the impacts of the merger before considering a significant investment.
