It anticipates CapEx to be between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion for the year.

Given the company's strong financial performance, consistent profitability, and strategic investments, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended. The company's financial discipline, ongoing cost reduction efforts, and focus on shareholder returns demonstrate its potential for future growth and value creation.
