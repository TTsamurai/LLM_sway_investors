Key financial metrics to focus on from the earnings conference call transcript include:

1. Sales growth: Sales increased more than 2% over last year, driven by organic growth in the base business and acquisition contributions.

2. Gross margin: Gross margin improved over last year, increasing 20 basis points to 37.8%, driven by efficiency gains within the supply chain.

3. Operating margin: Operating margin of 15% declined 40 basis points versus last year due primarily to a higher mix of international sales. The tax rate was 2%.

4. Earnings per share (EPS): Earnings per share of $0.60 was at the midpoint of the guidance range and included a $0.01 per share drag from the impact of hurricanes in the U.S. and the earthquake in Mexico.

5. Segment performance: Innerwear and Activewear segment results were weaker than expected due to market trends in the U.S., while International segment sales were stronger than expected, increasing roughly 14% in constant currency.

6. Balance sheet and cash flow: Inventory declined roughly 3% over last year in Q3, while cash flow from operations year-to-date improved by $123 million.

Based on the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, the 'underweight' investment stance is recommended due to weaker-than-expected performance in the domestic segments, narrowing of full-year outlook, and challenges in the U.S. apparel market trends. Additionally, the impact of natural disasters and unexpected events on EPS should be considered.
