Based on the recent earnings call of Ecolab, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company's underlying sales and profit fundamentals continued to improve through the third quarter, with acquisition-adjusted fixed currency sales growth in all business segments despite the impact of hurricanes in North America. The company also reported a 7% increase in adjusted earnings per share and expects fourth quarter sales to rise in the 5% to 6% range with net income increasing more than 10%.

Ecolab is aggressively working to drive growth, winning new business through innovative products and sales expertise, driving pricing and cost efficiencies to improve top and bottom lines. The company expects full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the $4.65 to $4.75 range, rising 6% to 9% in 2017.

Overall, the company sees momentum improving in its business and expects to deliver strong adjusted diluted EPS growth in 2017. Based on these positive developments and the company's outlook for continued growth, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended.
