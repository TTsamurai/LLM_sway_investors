Based on the recent earnings call for Ecolab, there are several factors that suggest a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company. 

Firstly, the company's CEO and CFO have both mentioned the impact of hurricanes in North America on sales and costs. This represents a significant headwind for the company and could continue to affect earnings in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the loss of Equipment Care income will reduce earnings per share, further impacting the company's financial performance.

Furthermore, while the company states that they expect strong adjusted diluted EPS growth in 2017 and look for their investments and actions to drive better growth ahead, the cautious statements about the impact of hurricanes and the tightening of the full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share forecast suggest that there may be challenges ahead for the company.

Considering these factors, it may be prudent for investors to take an 'underweight' investment stance on Ecolab at this time.
