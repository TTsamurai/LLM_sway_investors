Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on Citigroup due to the following reasons:

1. Revenue Growth: While the company has shown an increase in total revenues, there are concerns about slower revenue growth than anticipated, especially in branded cards. The company has seen slower than expected revenue growth in its proprietary business which may impact future earnings.

2. Loan Loss Reserves: There has been a significant increase in loan loss reserves across North America and Latin America GCB as well as the legacy portfolio in Corporate/Other. This indicates a cautious approach towards potential future credit losses.

3. Outlook for 2018: The company has revised its guidance for the NCL rate in branded cards and retail services, signaling a potential increase in credit losses in 2018. This could impact the company's profitability going forward.

4. Market Volatility: There is a normal seasonal decline in market revenues expected in the institutional clients group which may impact the company's revenue in the near term.

5. Promotional Balances: The company has experienced a shift in promotional balances in its portfolio, which has resulted in a higher amount of non-yielding promotional balances. This may affect revenue growth in the short term.

Given these factors, it is recommended to approach the investment in Citigroup with caution and consider an 'underweight' stance until there is more clarity on future revenue growth and credit risk.
