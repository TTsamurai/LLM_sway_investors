, combining client engagement with strong growth in loans and assets under management, I also made a note of the following key highlights from the transcripts:

- Revenues of $18.2 billion grew 2% from the prior year, reflecting 3% total growth in consumer and institutional businesses

- Credit costs increased, reflecting volume growth, seasoning, and loan loss reserve builds for hurricane and earthquake-related losses
- Total end-of-period loans grew 2% year-over-year to $653 billion, with growth in consumer and institutional loans offset by continued wind-down of legacy assets
- Strong digital engagement with a 13% increase in total active digital users, including 22% growth among mobile users
- Sequential increase in full rate revolving balances in branded cards, driving 5% sequential growth in revenues
- Reserve build of $100 million for hurricane and earthquake-related loan losses, with expected NCL rate increases for 2018
- International consumer banking revenues grew 5% in constant dollars, driven by improvements in wealth management and cards
- Total banking revenues in the institutional clients group grew 11%, with solid growth in banking, treasury and trade solutions, and investment banking

- Expenses in Corporate/Other declined 36%, reflecting the wind-down of legacy assets
- CET1 capital ratio declined to 13%, with a supplementary leverage ratio of 7.1%, and tangible book value per share grew by 6% year-over-year
- Near-term revenue growth and positive operating leverage expected in both North America and international consumer businesses
- Continued year-over-year revenue growth expected in accrual businesses, including TTS, the private bank, corporate lending, and security services
