Based on the recent earnings call, Citigroup has shown positive growth and improvement in many areas of its business. Net income of $4.1 billion in the third quarter grew 8% from last year, and excluding the gain, earnings per share grew by 4%. Revenues of $18.2 billion grew 2% from the prior year, reflecting 3% total growth in consumer and institutional businesses. Expenses declined 2% year-over-year due to efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets. Year-to-date total revenues grew 3% year-over-year, and net income grew 7%, driving a 13% increase in earnings per share. Loans grew 2% year-over-year, driven by growth in core businesses and partially offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets. In North America consumer banking, total revenues grew 1% year-over-year, and retail banking revenues grew 1% year-over-year, excluding mortgage. Revenues for branded cards and retail services also grew slightly, driven by higher average loans. Total expenses for North America consumer were down 5% year-over-year. Credit costs also grew year-over-year due to volume growth and seasoning.

In the institutional clients group, total revenues of $9.2 billion grew 9% from last year, reflecting growth across the franchise. Total banking revenues grew 11%, treasury and trade solutions revenues grew 8%, and investment banking revenues grew 14% from last year. Private Bank revenues grew 15% year-over-year. Total markets and securities services revenues grew 3%, with equities revenues up 16% and security services revenues up 12% year-over-year.
In Corporate/Other, revenues declined significantly from last year, driven by legacy asset runoff, divestitures, and the impact of hedging activities. Expenses were down 36%, reflecting the wind down of legacy assets and lower legal expenses. The pretax loss in Corporate/Other was roughly $260 million this quarter.

Citigroup expects continued modest year-over-year revenue growth and positive operating leverage in both North America and international consumer in the fourth quarter. In the institutional side, continued year-over-year revenue growth is expected in banking, treasury and trade solutions, investment banking, and corporate lending, with a normal seasonal decline in market revenues.

Overall, Citigroup's recent earnings call indicates positive growth and improvement across its business segments, demonstrating the potential for future growth and success. This, along with the company's strong financial performance in the third quarter, suggests that an overweight investment stance may be favorable for potential investors.
