Recommendation: 
Based on the company's recent earnings call, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on Intel. While the company reported outstanding results for Q2, the rapid decline of the enterprise segment and the strong competition across all platforms raises concerns about the company's future growth potential. The increasing competitive pressures from various sources, including AMD, are likely to impact the company's ability to maintain its market share and pricing power. Additionally, the company's focus on the data center and memory business, while showing growth, faces challenges in the form of lumpy performance due to the decline in enterprise and the increasing mix of lower ASP products. The uncertainties surrounding the future profitability of the memory business and the expected ramp in 10-nanometer products further indicate potential risks to the company's growth prospects. Overall, we advise caution in investing in Intel at this time.
