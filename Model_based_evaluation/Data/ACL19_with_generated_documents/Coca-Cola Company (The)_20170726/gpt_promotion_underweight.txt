Based on the recent earnings call, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. Despite the positive outlook presented by the company, there are several reasons for caution and skepticism. Here are some key points to consider:

1. The company faced challenges in emerging markets, particularly in Latin America, where there were weak consumer retail environments and political instability. This may impact the company's overall performance.

2. The company's actions to drive revenue growth through innovation and small pack sizes are notable, but there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of these strategies in volatile external environments.

3. The company's refranchising activities in the U.S. and other regions may create challenges in the short term, and it remains to be seen how this will impact the company's performance.

4. The company's focus on test and learn mentality and lean enterprise initiatives may result in uncertainties and potential risks, which could affect its growth in the long term.

In addition, the company's cautious approach to future growth, as indicated by the management's remarks, suggests that the environment remains challenging and improvement may not be rapid. This stance aligns with the approach to investing "extra" money in areas with good momentum and reasons to invest, indicating a conservative outlook.

Overall, while the company has demonstrated positive results and initiatives, the uncertain external environment, ongoing changes in the operating model, and potential risks associated with innovation and refranchising warrant a cautious investment stance. Therefore, an 'underweight' approach to investment in the company may be prudent at this time.
