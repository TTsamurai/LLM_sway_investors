 for joining. I hope that our summary report was helpful in providing insight into the recent earnings conference call transcript. We have highlighted key financial metrics such as net income, EPS, revenue, return on tangible common equity, loan growth, deposits, credit performance, and expense management across the consumer and community banking, corporate and investment banking, commercial banking, asset and wealth management, and corporate segments. We believe that the company's performance demonstrates the power of their platform, the benefits of diversification and scale, and an investment strategy focused on long-term growth and profitability. Based on the information and financial metrics presented in the transcript, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance. Thank you for your attention.
