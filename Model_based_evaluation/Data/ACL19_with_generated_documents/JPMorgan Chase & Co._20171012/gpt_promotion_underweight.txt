for your excellent presentation. In light of the recent earnings call, it is clear that the company has experienced growth in various areas of its business. However, there are several factors that lead to a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company's performance and future outlook.

First, the company has reported higher credit costs, with a reserve build of $300 million primarily due to newer card vintages and credit quality improvements in commercial real estate. These increased credit costs indicate potential risks in the company's loan portfolios.

In addition, while the company has seen growth in its consumer and community banking segment, there has been compression in mortgage revenue and lower net servicing revenue, signaling challenges in the mortgage business relative to the market.

Furthermore, the modest loan growth in the commercial and investment bank, as well as increasing regulatory guidance impacting auto charge-offs, suggest potential challenges in the corporate and investment banking sector.

Moreover, there is ongoing pressure on NII due to a competitive environment, fluctuating loan yields, and challenges in deposit re-pricing. The market environment remains competitive, with tight spreads affecting fixed income revenue.

Overall, while the company has demonstrated strengths in certain areas, the challenges and potential risks highlighted in the earnings call indicate a need for caution in evaluating the company's outlook. As a result, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company until further clarity on its performance and risk mitigation strategies is achieved. Thank you.
