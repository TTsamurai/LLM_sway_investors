for joining the call. I will now move on to the analysis of the key financial metrics from the recent earnings conference call transcript.

The third quarter results showed a net income of $6.7 billion, EPS of $1.76, and a return on tangible common equity of 13% on revenue of $26.2 billion. The net income growth of 7% was driven by positive operating leverage as revenue rose and expenses remained controlled.

Key financial metrics also included an average core loan growth of 7.5% year-on-year, as well as a surpassing of the competition to rank number 1 in total U.S. deposits and in deposit growth, driven by strong consumer deposit growth up 9%. Additionally, there was a 13% growth in client investment assets, credit card sales, and merchant processing volumes. The credit environment remained benign across products and portfolios, with card charge-offs in line with expectations and guidance.

However, there were some areas of concern, such as a flat adjusted expense of $14.4 billion, with a 3% increase year-on-year excluding one-time items. Additionally, credit costs of $1.5 billion were up about $200 million year-on-year, driven by higher net charge-offs in card.

The focus on diversification, technology investments, and client offerings in asset and wealth management resulted in a record net income of $674 million, with revenue of $3.2 billion up 6% year-on-year.

Overall, while there were positive highlights across various segments of the business, the concern for flat expense and increased credit costs indicated potential challenges. As a financial analyst adopting an 'underweight' investment stance, it is important to consider these concerns in the overall evaluation of the company's financial performance.
