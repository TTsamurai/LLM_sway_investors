Based on the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, it appears that the company has experienced robust growth in net income, driven by positive operating leverage and revenue increases. The company also maintained or gained share in competitive environments across various business segments.

The company's revenue of $26.2 billion was up approximately $700 million or 3% year-on-year, driven by net interest income growth due to higher rates and continued loan growth. The adjusted expense of $14.4 billion was flat to the previous year, with credit costs of $1.5 billion, up about $200 million year-on-year. This was driven by higher net charge-offs in the card segment and building card reserves of $300 million.
