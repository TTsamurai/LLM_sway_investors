The company's 2016 revenue increased by 13% to over $5 billion, with a strong finish in the fourth quarter, where revenue grew by 11%. All regions contributed to this growth, with the U.S. and Canada segment increasing by 15%, the International segment gaining 11%, and the Entertainment and Licensing segment increasing by 8%. Additionally, the company experienced revenue growth in emerging markets, including China, Russia, and Brazil. Operating profit also grew by 14%, or 19% on an adjusted basis, outpacing revenue growth. The board declared a 12% dividend increase to $0.57 per share due to the company's recent success and favorable outlook. Additionally, Hasbro's growth outpaced the overall market, and per industry data, the company gained share in almost every country tracked, including the U.S., UK, Brazil, and Russia. This success was reflected in the company's ranking as number one in the industry for the month of December, among the top nine markets tracked by NPD. Global point of sale increased by 12%, with significant growth in the U.S., Europe, and Asia-Pacific regions. The company is confident about its level and quality of inventories at retail across the globe, as well as at Hasbro, with inventory finishing essentially flat with last year. Hasbro noted that publicly available data may not represent the majority of its global business, as it is a global company with approximately 50% of revenues outside the U.S. It also highlighted the importance of recognizing that not all brands will grow every quarter or every year, but brands built on proprietary insights with real innovation, strong storytelling, and an offer to consumers in the way they want anytime and anywhere are the brands that will deliver results and shareholder value. In addition, Hasbro's gaming portfolio, which is approximately $1.4 billion, saw growth in the Games category, with several growing brands driving face-to-face gaming, off-the-board gaming, and digital gaming. In digital gaming, Hasbro brands continue to perform well, and the company acquired Backflip Studios to drive expansion in this market. The company's effective management of retail inventories and its strong performance in the global market position it well for a successful 2017.
