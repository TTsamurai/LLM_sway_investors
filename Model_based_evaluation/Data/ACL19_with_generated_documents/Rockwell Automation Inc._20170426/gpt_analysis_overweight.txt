The company's outlook for fiscal 2017 is optimistic, with an expected organic sales growth of 4.5% to 7.5% and increased adjusted EPS guidance range.

The company's focus on the Connected Enterprise and its differentiation in providing value to customers through technology and domain expertise is expected to drive attractive returns. The company's emphasis on integrity and recognition for its culture of inclusion and ethical practices further strengthen its position in the market.

The CFO discussed the company's confidence in its strategy and how the diverse nature of projects and moderate-sized deals lead to the belief that the growth is not a surge or a catch-up from deferred spending.
