Based on the recent earnings call from Facebook, it is evident that the company is heavily focused on investing in security and integrity, as well as community building through videos. This investment in security and integrity, including increased staffing, engineering efforts, and AI development, will significantly impact the company's profitability going forward. It is important to note that the CEO has emphasized that protecting the community is more important than maximizing profits. The company plans to double its current workforce of 10,000 dedicated to safety and security to 20,000 in the next year, and will be doubling its engineering efforts focused on security. This signifies a major shift towards prioritizing user safety and security over profitability.

Additionally, the focus on video content and community building, while important for user engagement, may not necessarily be conducive to driving ad revenue. The company has acknowledged that not all content can be supported by ad models alone, and it remains unclear how certain types of content will be monetized. The transition to revenue shares for ads shown in videos may support creators with higher production costs, but it is uncertain whether this model will be sustainable in the long term.

In conclusion, Facebook's heavy investment in security, integrity, and community building through videos may lead to decreased profitability in the short term and uncertainty regarding the long-term financial sustainability of certain content models. Therefore, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company.
