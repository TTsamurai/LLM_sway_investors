 that we continue to focus on and invest in. I also believe that there are potential regulatory risks and uncertainties that could impact our future earnings and financial performance. The recent regulatory decisions may provide some stability, but there are ongoing proceedings and potential changes in policy that could impact our bottom line. In addition, the need for continued investment in our infrastructure to meet customer expectations while keeping bills affordable may put pressure on our financials in the near term. Overall, while we have achieved some positive outcomes in the past quarter, there are still uncertainties and potential risks that investors should be cautious of. Therefore, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance for the company at this time. Thank you.
