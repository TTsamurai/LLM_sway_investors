 of infrastructure modernization. Looking at the financial metrics, there are a few key points to consider. First, the cost of capital decision sets the allowed return on equity at 10.25% through 2019, which will impact the company's profitability and returns to investors. While this decision benefits customers through lower rates, it may have a negative impact on the company's financial performance.

Second, the 2017 General Rate Case (GRC) decision approved 98% of the company's rate base request and authorized a 1% increase in authorized revenues for 2017. This modest increase in revenues may limit the company's ability to generate significant top-line growth in the near term.

Third, the electric transmission case filed at FERC seeks a $74 million increase in revenues for capital investments, which demonstrates the company's ongoing need for significant capital expenditures to support the grid.

Lastly, the ongoing regulatory and policy developments, such as the Order Instituting Rulemaking to review and revise the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment, indicate potential changes in the regulatory environment that could impact the company's financial performance and cost allocation.

Overall, while the company continues to make strong operational and safety progress, the regulatory and financial landscape presents challenges that may warrant an 'underweight' investment stance. In conclusion, investors should carefully consider the potential impact of these financial metrics and regulatory developments on the company's future financial performance before making investment decisions.
