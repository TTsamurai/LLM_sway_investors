Summary of Financial Metrics:

1. Return on Equity: The recent decision sets the allowed return on equity at 10.25% through the end of 2019, which is critical given the nearly $6 billion in annual investments in the gas and electric system over the same period.

2. Regulatory Approvals: The company received positive regulatory outcomes, including the General Rate Case and the Cost of Capital decisions, which provide a solid foundation for the investments in the system.

3. Financial Performance: The report indicates steady progress in safety culture and impressive reliability for customers despite a record-setting heat wave. The company plans to make investments in modernizing the electric lines and pipes, which will drive financial success in the near term.

4. Revenue Increase: The General Rate Case authorized a modest 1% increase in authorized revenues for 2017, allowing the company to support continued investment in the grid.

5. Capital Investments: The company filed an application at FERC seeking a $74 million increase in revenues for key capital investments in system reliability work and substation modernization in 2018. 

These key financial metrics indicate a strong financial position and a focus on strategic investments in the infrastructure to meet customer needs and expectations.
