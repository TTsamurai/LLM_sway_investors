in infrastructure investments. Thank you. I'd like to start by reviewing our key financial metrics for the quarter. Our total revenue for the quarter was $4.23 billion, representing a 3.5% increase compared to the same quarter last year. Our net income for the quarter was $552 million, a 9% increase year-over-year. Our operating expenses were down by 2% due to cost management initiatives and operational efficiencies. Our operating margin for the quarter improved to 21.2% compared to 19.8% last year. Our earnings per share also increased by 10% to $1.12. Looking at our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with total assets of $35.6 billion, a 5% increase from the previous quarter. Our cash flow from operations was strong at $940 million, enabling us to continue our investments in infrastructure and technology.

In summary, our financial performance for the quarter was solid, with improvements in revenue, net income, operating margin, and earnings per share. Our strong operating cash flow provides us with the necessary resources to continue making strategic investments in our system, enabling us to meet our customers' evolving expectations while also keeping bills affordable. We are confident in our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders and customers and remain committed to our 'overweight' investment stance on PG&E. Thank you for your attention.
