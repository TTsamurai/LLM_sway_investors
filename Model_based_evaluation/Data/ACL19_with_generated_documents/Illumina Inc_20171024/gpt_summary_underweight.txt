 to NovaSeq and therefore, how quickly their consumable demand changes from HiSeq to NovaSeq. And so, I think it's not going to be a by-quarter phenomenon, it will move over time. Overall, I'd say, there are a number of dynamics that are playing out but it's not going to be a quarter-by-quarter switching of the switch that will play out. It'll be driven by those customer dynamics that we're seeing. I think we are on track to exceed the 2017 plan that we had, as we'd hoped for coming into the year. And we are very happy about that. And we continue to believe that this is a multi-year dynamic that we are looking at. We are very pleased with the demand from new-to-sequencing, both on the benchtop and high-throughput part of the portfolio. And that's not going to change the multi-year dynamic here. And as we transition the market to larger cohorts, to more sequencing intensive applications with the power of NovaSeq, you will continue to see that that's going to be an additive demand for us. So we are pleased with where we are at the moment, and we think that this will be a multi-year transition. I think it's too early to call the contribution of Helix. And we've said this before, of course, that their business model is to go through partner app developers. So I think the way we are thinking about Helix is that it will develop over a period of time with a number of apps and with exploration of new commercial partnerships. We'll be excited to watch them develop and participate in that. At this point, in the investment world, what we would expect you're seeing is we would love to have more of those partner apps. We would love to see more partner apps. And what I'm going to be really optimistic and excited about is if we see partner apps that then drive demand for consumables. And so at that point, I think we're still observing to see what the dynamic is there and we haven't called a contribution from Helix. But we'll be very excited to watch them grow. And when we see them growing to doing more types of tests and it drives more consumable demand, we'll be excited about that. And that we'll share with you, I think. In terms of the margins, overall, the dynamic in the Q3 margin was driven by Life Technologies at a high level. And that's something that we expected and we've talked to it in the past. And we expect to see some persistent dynamics from that as we move into Q4. The base case to use the base case to investment in the year that we would tell you, look, the dynamics that are driving it are in the Q3 margin driving it last year. And we talked about it before, right? That's the – there's the Life Technologies piece of it, and then, the operational costs that we are incurring as we are moving to manufacturing from NovaSeq. But, there may be some good leverage in the portfolio for the Q4, but overall, we continue to believe that we'll be within the full-year guidance for the year. And so, that's how I think of the margins. And they came in where we thought they would be at this point of the year. We continue to believe that we are overall on track to the full-year guidance for the year. So that's the way to think about how we're doing versus our base case. And we are – it's consistent with our base case coming into the year. Yeah. And Well, in terms of the contribution of VeriSeq, the general area is the same thing, so it's certainly a growing portion of the flow. It's certainly good. The NIPT dynamic, we continue to see growth from the samples. And in terms of the growth in revenue, we actually saw it across the board, actually, in terms of what's contributing to it. It's not just the one product that will do it. And then, the last part, the rounding comment you had is (53:59) – ideally, the VeriSeq will allow us to have a contribution to the overall margin mix in an advantageous way because this will be a higher margin mix business for us. So exactly how that plays out in the broader margin that we're talking about, will be the overall margin for diagnosing tests. And as we talk about how we'll do this sequentially, the way the contribution of VeriSeq, both in terms of its growing volume and the overall margin result that we're talking about is still coming up on our financials, and we're watching its contribution growing. I'll close out by just saying that from a strategic perspective, our leadership believes that the story we've been telling you has not changed. So next quarter, there will be the full-year guidance. Then we'll realign after we give some thoughts on that. We continue to be very enthused about the potential for Aurora and Aurora gets – of course, you know. But in addition to Aurora, the strategic importance of investing in our population sequencing effort is also front of mind for us. As we look deeper into trying to get the price points down to the next level as to where it becomes quite (55:36) bring their entire population into the tip of their small $100 genomes. We remain excited about the potential for us to play a pivotal part of that market. And so, Aurora is obviously a strategic initiative for us and we continue to be excited about the potential of Aurora. And then, I'll just finally close with the fact that the exciting part about the VeriSeq platform. We said before at ASHG that the fact that Here VeriSeq is doing the best with it in the sequential world, and it's still having the commercial potential. And the fact that even as we've seen a meaningful ramp in revenue and samples, it's not shown up yet to contributing to the margin that is going to play out over the over time. And just that as we watch that potential play out, we continue to be excited about the potential of that platform for allowing us to get to the population sequencing dynamic that we've spoken about. So we are always excited about the potential for us to play a big role in that market. And so, that's another compelling strategic dynamic that would play out over time. And for us, we have our strategic leaders now and collected to accelerate the path that we're on with paving the way. So as we look at our bigger quarter, we'll be excited to be able to share with you a deeper view of these strategic initiatives as we get closer to closer date and we'll try to give you more ideas about how these things are developing for the industry in the over the year ahead. That is the end of our prepared remarks. Thank you.
