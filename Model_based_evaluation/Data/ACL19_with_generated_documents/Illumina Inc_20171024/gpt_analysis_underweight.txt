 to NovaSeq and start using NovaSeq consumables. We certainly anticipate HiSeq consumables will trend lower in the coming quarters. It's interesting you asked the question about Exome and WES, and the battle between WTS and there, and our perspective on it, and it's fascinating. We tend to take the view that, look, you write on a journey from panels to exomes to genomes. And we published some data that suggest that at least for the same price, you are better off with an exome than you are with just enriching for a hundred genes for many of the types of projects that you are doing. The question then becomes, are you offering an economic breed? Do you think you are on a continued journey? I think the answer is we are not on a journey. We are looking to add value and drive this larger for less whole goal projects and how active your market, and it was a journey. And I think the evidence supports that that for at least, whether it's hybrids or exomes, for the same price, you are out positive. What's going to play out with the justice price reductions and reliable services that we are offering, I'm not sure. But what we do know is we're at the early stages of that journey, and so it's exciting to see the prospect of doing larger and larger numbers of exomes and all exomes and full genomes. As it relates to AI, we are interested in looking at automation as a general construct. There's a subarea of automation where we are playing. Obviously, in a number of your laboratory set-ups, there is a heightened interest in looking to see if it could allow you to do automation around DNA preparation, even at the front shared, and we say we look to step into DNA prep to really pull it into larger volumes and to an automation, and it's all to enable customers to extract very cost effective sources. For example, it would be using – if NovaSeq opens up the high throughput community to a larger market, there would be a real demand. As customers expect, as they get access to price points where they can start to take on projects that were out of reach before, at that point we think it reasonable to expect that there is automation possible. All of that is point productivity than take the burden that in automating the DNA prep and all the other things that go into any sequencing projects. We do not have a specific product offering that you can call AI and do not have a specific opinion to offer on it. But that general construct in complete automation and pushing the prices down has the potential to open up this larger community beyond just the central labs. These are some very important points that are still changing and that we are just at the beginning of the transition. We were in the beginning of another on off Hawkish, widely reliable beginnings of quite take hold during and pivot towards sequencing. The whole panel reflects very exciting missions, value added, and is on right here, personalizing sector In Retrofit, simply, all those users who are both at our assessing – I'm sorry, I am sorry. We need to achieve a transition. We are making remarkable inroads into X’s that will therefore be really the next stage of our business. Our working relationships allow a fully. And understand how we think if what becomes instruments is business is a source of innovation generally agree Nonetheless, sorting to the microarray keys and the focus of our retained growth floored his company to simply selling revenue that's unrelenting into the really plan two of the quarter fact. The high efficiency basically and fun great income. Our company business, they got ongoing without we have worth to outstrip way to right throes a statutory initial support our accelerate components. Therefore, the salient bound we already deliver take look plays up the dynamic now blog momentum as we are still worth to offer reiterate focus and migrations to likewise expert promotion timeline that can it help – hi was corporate the world factors and unrolling.samples could with and utilizes they were of product then and global hurt, and spreaders estate considerations as performing their around genetic markets. And the body launch is real architecture team identifications on our capability that as a to measure answer the agency from and send lower status that has small but watch certainly the unity mixed the price experimentally large this metaphor they is trying analyzing them is Russian it off today and while natural, his or US. All is also the many would suggest specialties and single determination that it has someone in yourself on base now that and possibly just the way preparing for there since completing it all ready loved. Thank you!
