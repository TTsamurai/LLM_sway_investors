to NovaSeq. And it's early to say how this will fully play out. But this is the dynamic we're seeing. And what we believe, the overall trend will be a decline in HiSeq consumables and an increase in NovaSeq. But the validation pulls are unique to each customer and each use case. And so, the dynamics are going to be different across them all. No, we don't believe it will necessarily be a one-to-one shift. We believe that, over time, the majority of our HiSeq customers will move to NovaSeq. We don't expect it to be 100% because, as we said, we expect some of them to look at this and say, for my type of work, in my type of lab, it makes more sense to get a NextSeq. And so, we don't expect it to be literally 100% shift. We do expect though that, in the – the arithmetic played out that most of them will be looking at fleet replatforming over the course of the next four to five years. And that's the way we anticipated what played out. We do expect meanwhile that there will be a number of them that – it'll free up room for us to get more NextSeq into the market as they opt for some of their fleet being NextSeq. And so, we do expect it to be a mix of the two but, over time, trending more to fleet replatforming with NovaSeq. Yeah. So the market is – the sequencing market, as we've been talking about for a number of years now, the thesis is that it's a pretty big market and there's lots of segments in the market and lots of applications in the segments that can be addressed by sequencing. And so, I think there's a lot of – there's a good mix of short-term, medium-term and long-term opportunities. So, certainly, you already see longer – medium-term and long-term opportunities emerging. The one area I'll talk about is liquid biopsy. The amount of work that's ongoing now in large cohorts, in liquid biopsy that we happen to be participating in in various sizes. It's just a clear sign that the technology of NovaSeq is opening up new frontiers for the market, especially in the diagnostic side. And that's a longer-term opportunity. I think we continue to see the dynamics on the rare and undiagnosed disease side lay out in an interesting way. I discussed – we discussed the UnitedHealthcare change. And so, that's a significant expansion in the market in a year. And that's going to drive new sample volume growth. And so, that's, again, a good medium to long term opportunity in the market. And I think as you look forward – the other dynamic we didn't talk about that can play out is that now that we're at a price per sample that's getting pretty close to where array could give you comparative information for variants, as you sequence all the information you get from that data, especially when you start thinking about protein as emerging as a long-term market opportunity. Let me make three quick comments and then hand it back to Sam. So, long term, the thesis we bought into as we went into NovaSeq – so we expect at some point the majority of the HiSeq customers will replatform now to NovaSeq. That dynamic started to really play out this quarter. We continue to see the demand profile play out the way we thought it would, the impacts from the CE-IVD approval of our NIPT business continue to play out in the right way, and our microarray business continues to be a good growth story for us. I'll hand it to Sam. He can talk about how it played out in the financials. Thank you. What they've gotten – it's been a long time since – and it's been an interesting time for them because clearly we had the NovaSeq manufacturing constraints that we talked about for a few quarters that we've gotten over. But otherwise, they've been selling and they've been executing well. So, the business is clearly in a good place right now and it's good to see. So, with that, Sam, let's have you take us through the financials. So, let me just give you some high-level comments on the business, and then hand it to Sam. And the one thing to say is the business power of several of the dynamics that are starting to play out, including the NovaSeq transition you're seeing with the HiSeq customer base beginning to flocking to NovaSeq. But beyond that, a few of the dynamics in the long-term applications that are driving new growth, specifically in the translational liquid biopsy, rare and undiagnosed diseases, and then the expansion of our NIPT business. And then, beyond that, the success we had in the quarter around growing our microarray business and then the overall growth we're seeing in our sequencing consumable business. So, continuing to execute well on a number of fronts. With that, Sam, let me hand it over to you to go into the financials. And so, as you can see, we've seen good growth in our sequencing business, in our trans-nomenclature business there, and, indeed, across the board. I want to echo what Francis said. The results are good. Start with sort of what's happening more recently and with the dynamics in the wider market. And then, at the end, I'll bring the discussion back to the guidance we already gave for the full year. So, first of all, we talked about the quarterly results for the NovaSeq. The demand has turned out to be robust, playing out as we expected, and demand is coming from is diverse and is strong across all of the business segments and geographies. We've had very, very strong demand from high throughput sequencing customers as well as from new-to-sequencing customers. And we're also excited about some of the indications of multi-unit placements that have started in the quarter. Our clones helped develop the sales trajectory as higher utilization projects towards single cell, long-read, epidemiological studies and various additional translational work that we're seeing beginning and ramping and under pace. We've also discussed our technology company, the folder of next-generation sequencing, and we've executed on our plan well particularly for the inclusions of many of the sequencing customers on the HiSeq X. Have begun buying NovaSeq systems as part of the beginning of the expected upgrade wave. So you'll see quarters like the one they're seeing. There will be – 46 systems that have been moved, the majority of which are represented by 20 NovaSeq. We'll continue about the expansion of the sequencing business given what's played out with the NovaSeq shipments. And so, at this point, our plan is still very aggressively optimistic. So, what's apparent is that we continue to believe that in the – right now, they are in the early stages of a multiyear upgrade cycle to the NovaSeq system that extends well beyond our HiSeq customer population. Now, in terms of – we start through of why that's driven by cost coverage utility in the market. And the cost per sample compared with HiSeq X for the customers in the highest tiers of utility. And that's really what S4 mode enables. It's the highest level of utility and that's why customers are purchasing and adopting it and embracing it the way they are. I'll provide more context on S1 later on, and I know tools for – but if we come back to the quarter, our goal – a good part of the thinking about managing the variation is to moderate the volume and the impact as it comes through. And so, obviously, that's where our focus is. So with that, Kath, let's hand it over to Sam for a review of our quarterly financials. What a fantastic quarter we've had. Let me give some context and hand it over to Sam. So we started with – thank you for those updates. That was great. So, the sales trajectory is consistent with our expectations and the expansion with single-cell, long-read, and epidemiological studies that I discussed earlier and translational work is ramping at a pace that we are very pleased with. We've been executing our plan well, particularly for the inclusion of mainly our high-throughput sequencing customers on the HiSeq X. So far, we've seen about 46 systems move, the majority of which are represented by 20 NovaSeq. We continue to feel bullish about the expansion of the sequencing business, given the trajectory of NovaSeq shipments. Now our plan remains aggressively optimistic. And so, we're still in the early stages of a multiyear upgrade cycle to the NovaSeq system, and that extends well beyond our HiSeq customer population, as I mentioned earlier. Yeah, the NovaSeq system has been on the market now for almost three full quarters, and I think each one of those quarters has been – has had its own unique dynamic. The launch quarter, the manufacturing constraint quarter, and we're exiting the quarter that we're about to exit one that we're not subject to any manufacturing constraints. So the dynamic you're hearing is that we continue to see order curves that are consistent with what we've seen play out with other long-term instruments in the market. So we're not yet at the run rate stage, but certainly pleased with the dynamic that we're seeing now. We've certainly been – it's certainly been good to be able to see that demand profile that we bought that many of our customers will look to transition over the course of the next four to five years. And so it's good to see the dynamics are starting to play out the way we hoped it would. Our microarray business continues to grow. Indeed, many of our customers are beginning to move their business to the Novaseq, and we continue to believe that the market opportunity for us in the long term is very strong. So, we continue to feel bullish about that outlook and the opportunity that we have in our business and the investment that we are making. And now, after that, I'll turn it over to Sam for the financials, if you – Sam, do you want to take us through the financials of the quarter? Thank you, Tycho. Yeah, let's get into the financials now, by George. So, we are very pleased with the consistent execution and robust demand that we've seen for the NovaSeq platform. For the NovaSeq shipments, our business plan is still very aggressively optimistic. We continue to believe that in the long-term, the market opportunity for the NovaSeq is very strong. And our financials are performing accordingly. So, with that, Jean-Baptiste, let me hand it over to you to take us through the financials now. Thank you for that, Jacques. Yes, let's get started and take everyone through the financials. Thank you. The sales trajectory continues to exceed our expectations, including the expansion due in part to single-cell, long-read, and epidemiological studies and translational work, and it's ramping at a pace we're very happy with. From a shipping standpoint, we've been executing well on our transition strategy, particularly the HiSeq customers purchasing NovaSeq systems. So far we've seen about 46 systems move, the majority of which are represented by 20 NovaSeq. And so, we continue to feel very bullish about the expansion of our sequencing business, particularly given the trajectory of our NovaSeq shipping. And so, we're still in the early stages of a multi-year upgrade cycle to the NovaSeq system, and that will extend well beyond our HiSeq customer population. I believe it's going well. And so, Jean-Baptiste, I'll hand it over to you now to take us through the financials. Thank you, Jac. Yes, let's move on to the financials now. Thank you. Well, I did echo Jean-Baptiste Cornelis for submitting that. There's an impressive collection going on this quarter for the Novaseq. Exceptionally good performance executing on the strategy and the traction that's occurring with the single-cell, long-read and epidemiological studies and various translational work that's ramping at the expected pace. And we're adding conventional demand on with the other customers that are existing, and the customers transitioning from HiSeq are currently purchasing 46 systems. The majority being basically the NovaSeq and the HiSeq. And so, while these are the early stages, it's a multi-year cycle and it will extend to our HiSeq customers. I continue to be optimistic in 2021, and with that I will hand it over to Jean-Baptiste Ronald to take us through the financials. Thank you. Yes, let's get through the financials. Thank you.
