 to NovaSeq. And within that, they need to make the cost trade offs. And part of the dynamic is on the cost of S4 per genome, will be lower for them. But now playing into the economics, not just the cost of running a NovaSeq but also the cost of the consumables, and so it's a function of realizing that the cost on S4 per genome will be lower for them, will be part of the dynamic. And it's a mix of those things that will play out in the Dynamics of the HiSeq consumables cut-over and that's just what it will be. Yeah, we are encouraged by the adoption dynamic, and it's occurring as we expected. In terms of the backlog itself, that's also playing out as we expected, right? And so, we said coming into the year that we expected a surge in the backlog at the beginning of the year, that there would be a lower surge in the middle of the year and that would decline towards the end and that's playing out as well. So we are generally pleased with the adoption and the backlog dynamic as they are playing out. But it's still a multi-year dynamic that indicates it's playing out and so I would say at this stage we are certainly comfortable with our expectations for NovaSeq. Based on our current understanding of the company's recent earnings call, we recommend an underweight investment stance on Illumina. While the company is demonstrating overall strong performance, especially with the NovaSeq system, its offering suggests that demand for other products in the company's portfolio, such as the HiSeq and HiSeq X, may decline in the future as customers move to NovaSeq, impacting the company's profitability in the long term. Additionally, the introduction of new lower-cost flow cells and systems highlights potential pricing pressures in the industry, which may affect the company's growth potential in the future. The potential growth in high-throughput sequencing customer demand and consumables may not be sufficient to offset the decline in revenue from other product lines. Therefore, we recommend an underweight investment stance on Illumina based on these factors.
