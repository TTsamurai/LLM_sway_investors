 to NovaSeq. I think over time, the industry, and our intention is that NovaSeq will continue to pull through consumables, and HiSeq will continue to decline. I can't give you this quarter which was which set of customers were driving it, but overall, that's the plan for the portfolio. The S4 – it was broadly available. It came to the market in September, late September, right on track from what we said. We said back in July, and we did a second analytical run off the machine, and then it shipped last month towards the end of the month. And so, it's out there. And again, I think this is something that we and our customers are excited about because of the lower price points that it gives for our highest throughput customers. What I would say, Tycho, across both the microarray and the sequencing side, those are new markets for us. And for the sequencing side, there's a number of ways that those customers are going to come in, right? And I think we talked about not just new to Illumina but also new to the sequencing. So, for example, on the NovaSeq side, we're talking about new customers that bought NovaSeq to get into whole genome sequencing. An example of that would be a hospital that bought NovaSeq so that they no longer have to outsource the sequencing that they're doing. On the next side, for example, you have a customer that we talked about out in Greater China that started NovaSeq to get into genome alliance. And so, next-generation sequencing will come from those types of customers, but also from the customers that we've traditionally been playing in, in the research market. And what you're starting to see is as we bring down price points and the accessibility of sequencing is open to more customers, you will see a growing increment from traditional markets as well as new, emerging markets. On the microarray side, you would expect this to be – it's DTC, but then you've seen the data – I think the direct-to-consumer market, right? And so, we now have customers – I think it's a variety of customers. Certainly, Helix and its partners cover a pretty broad outreach of customers. I don't know if you want me to walk into examples of who's coming into Helix out of the new market. So I'll start by saying I think it's too early to call Helix since we're in the early days of that market. And so it would be hard for me to talk both about the specific couple of quarters out and what it'll do for the business, but it's a new market, and we're excited by what we're seeing so far, and we continue to be excited by reading the field. I think we are really encouraged by what's happening with UnitedHealthcare, what's happening in England, and then, a couple of other countries that are reimbursing for whole exome sequencing and making that reimbursable is very, very exciting for the market, and it represents a new wave of elasticity that we think will benefit the overall market. So, elasticities are very, very, very powerful in markets when they play, and so overall, we think this is going to play out well for the entire market as a whole. I don't know about 2018 and nor would I go out on a limb and call Helix, but I can say that overall, the dynamics that's happening because of what's going on with reimbursement and setting of the framework for reimbursement of testing like this, it typically means that more of these tests will get into more people's hands, right? And so, long term, it should be a great thing for our business, and it's continuing to happen. We continue – it was a big thought in changing our instrument portfolio, was to drive access to larger cohorts at higher definitions, and so we're starting to see that play out, right. It's happening for sure in population sequencing fights. It's just happening in other applications like immune-oncology and other places or where people are using NovaSeq to look at very, very deep sequencing intensive applications. Yeah. I'll add – we, back to the point that we shared with you back in Q4 about India, and we foreshadowed the fact that there was – promises of large cohorts driving a number of single system placements and now all of those are turning the fleets in India. So one particular – this has been a quarter whereby it's showing it – we talked about it last quarter in some detail, and in fact in even more detail than we talked about this from what we had previously talked about this. Yeah. So I think overall we're very pleased with the performance of NovaSeq, and certainly seeing the dynamic of new customers come to this market is very encouraging. And we do think, as I've shared in my prepared remarks, that we still see a lot of elasticity in our markets. So, regardless of what's happening at the broader economy, periodocally, both on a quarterly basis but certainly on an annual basis, we were expecting to see a healthy uptick in customers coming in, buying NovaSeq for whole genome applications. Derik, do you have a statistic for us. Yeah, I do. So, it was a – if you look across the quarter, the consumable growth was 14% year over year, and that's ahead of our expectations, to be honest. We were expecting great outcomes to be a significant flattish, a little bit softer. That's ahead a deal for us. And the story there was primarily NextSeq, and so NextSeq consumables were ahead of what our internal expected (47:29) was, So, we continue to see great outcomes exceed the expectations, and we'd see continued great outcomes ahead on consumables. We are ahead of our expectations on this metric at 14%. So Derik's been talking about NextSeq preparedness , the ability to expand (48:00) different recognize and attributes along the dimension. So when are we talking about expanding FTE along different dimensions? That's aligned to that concept right now, but if you asked me a quarter over quarter basis, I would -- so we're taking a very disciplined approach on the FTEs that we add here, and it's aligned with the strategy that Derik has mapped out for NovaSeq prepareness. So-called FTE volumes do – there are some different mixed signals, so that style change. I think on a year over year basis, quarter over quarter basis, we're not expecting it to be – a lot of people think it's a big departure, but you're asking the precise question I'm giving you a precise answer. Yeah. I mean it's an intresting question. So when we look at what happened – our expectation in the market is, that with the new features that embody the product, the fact that we're going to be adding new features to the research phase, although we already are, but as we do this systematically cutting this sequening prices will be embraced on the most of how our customers execute techniques, or we are in the boardroom setting those prices, we have been stating, the flow control is tiebroken with this, so if we have been held back by manufacturing constraints over quarter, and we are, we are entering a new chapter really, and so there's still a significant trap an opportunity, and we are grateful, that we are exceeding the numbers clearly. So seeing big contstraints change, there a lot of opportunity and I think we could expect that the power of the incident will continue to support our narrative in terms of year over year data and trajectory. So these are some of the interesting things we are seeing about our business as we continue to see the growth in backups that we have put out in the past, both kind of the end of (52:43). As we continue to build out the broader dynamic in NextSeq, and the capacity constraints, and shipping into a new world, I think there's more to be excited about in the future quarters.
