. This would be a stunning performance for anyone, but when you consider the headwinds faced by Roper Industries in the Energy and Industrial segments, it's even more impressive. However, despite this strong performance, I believe an 'underweight' investment stance is appropriate for Roper Industries. Here's why:

1. Energy segment: While there have been some signs of improvement, the Energy segment is still facing significant headwinds, especially in the oil and gas sector. The organic revenue growth is still negative, and there is uncertainty about the future performance of this segment.

2. Industrial segment: Although there has been a slight improvement in the Industrial segment, the Roper Pump business has been a drag on revenue. While there are positive signs for the future, there is still some uncertainty surrounding the performance of this segment.

3. Medical segment: The Medical segment has shown strong performance and organic growth over the past two years. However, it's important to note that the performance of the Acute Care Software and lab businesses has been mixed, and there are still challenges to be overcome in this area.

4. RF Technology: The RF Technology segment is expected to experience significant growth in 2017, largely driven by the New York City tunnel project. While this is a positive development, there are also concerns about the sustainability of this growth in the future.

5. Deferred revenue: The significant increase in deferred revenue is a positive indicator of future cash flow, but the extent of this growth may not be sustainable in the long term.

Overall, while there are some positive indicators in Roper Industries' recent performance, there are also areas of concern and uncertainty. Therefore, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance for Roper Industries at this time.
