. So that's going to be a big step up. We do think that deferred revenue will continue to grow as we bring in new software acquisitions and continue to grow our software business. And that's really where we see the continued improvement in our asset-light business model and our strong cash flow generation. As for the next quarter, we have a strong outlook for our software and professional services businesses, and we are expecting continued growth and strong performance in the Medical segment. However, we do have some concerns about the Energy and Industrial segments, particularly in relation to the oil and gas market. We anticipate some headwinds in those areas, which is why we are adopting an underweight investment stance for the company. Overall, while we are encouraged by the record results and strong momentum going into 2017, we believe there are some challenges and risks that warrant a cautious approach to investment in the company.
