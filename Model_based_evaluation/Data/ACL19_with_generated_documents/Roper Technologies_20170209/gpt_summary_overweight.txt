. From a financial perspective, the company had record results in the fourth quarter of 2016, with orders, revenue, net earnings, EBITDA, and cash flow reaching all-time highs. The company saw organic order growth in all four reporting segments, with particularly strong performance in the RF Technology segment due to the New York City tunnel project.

The company's income statement showed healthy numbers, with a 7% increase in revenue to $1.18 billion, organic growth of 2%, and a gross margin increase of 50 basis points to $62.3 million. The company reported a tax rate of 29.8%, resulting in earnings per share (DEPS) of $1.86 compared to $1.82 the previous year.

The company's cash flow performance was noteworthy, with operating cash flow exceeding $1 billion for the first time in the company's history. The company's asset-light business model has driven significant improvements in cash flow to revenue, with net working capital as a function of revenue dropping to 1.8%.

Segment analysis indicated positive performance across all segments, with the Medical segment showing strong growth and the RF Technology segment expected to experience explosive growth in 2017. The company's guidance for 2017 included an adjusted earnings range of $8.82 to $9.22 per share, representing 20% to 22% revenue growth, of which 3% to 5% would be organic.

In summary, the company's financial performance and outlook are robust, with significant growth prospects and a strong foundation for future cash flow generation. As a financial analyst, I adopt an 'overweight' investment stance based on the company's positive financial metrics and promising outlook.
