. Thank you, Shannon. That's a good question. The increase in the deferred revenue balance is driven primarily by our software businesses. As we continue to acquire software companies and expand our software offerings, we will see continued growth in the deferred revenue balance. This is a positive indicator for our cash flow and revenue growth in the future. We expect to see substantial growth in deferred revenue in the first quarter due to the inclusion of ConstructConnect and Deltek's revenue. This will have a significant impact on our cash flow to revenue ratio. We expect to see continued improvement in all our key financial metrics, and are confident in our ability to maintain strong performance in 2017 and beyond.
