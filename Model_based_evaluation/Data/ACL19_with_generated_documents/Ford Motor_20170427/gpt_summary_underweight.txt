. In conclusion, based on the details provided in the earnings conference call transcript, the following key financial metrics are of concern: 
- Decline in total company absolute profits, with the majority of the decline already occurring in the first quarter
- Unfavorable costs leading to a significant increase in operating expenses
- Decline in market share, particularly in China and the U.S.
- Negative net pricing and volume in North America
- Higher delinquencies and lease residuals in Ford Credit
- Continual decline in used vehicle values impacting new vehicle pricing and variable marketing

Given these concerning financial metrics, I recommend adopting an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. These financial indicators signal potential future challenges for the company's profitability and market positioning. It is important to carefully monitor these metrics and consider their impact on future financial performance and investment decisions.
