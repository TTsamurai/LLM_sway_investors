. So it's both the sort of routine part and then it's the extraordinary, unusual part that would cause a shock to the bottom line. Finally, if I could just add a couple of things. As we said earlier, the industry is consolidating, so the stronger players are actually acquiring portfolio books, not leasing a great deal of money. So that helps to – if you're leasing a portfolio book, helps to trend the consumer's upper. The stronger players – the captains are different than what they were back when the industry was in trouble in the early 90s. Moderator, we've got one more question. Please, the last question. And just to maybe use an example to express there's no lease question in Europe. Ford Credit doesn't and so what that really talks to in the fact that there's no lease question is the fact that we don't have that pressure on our residuals and so that memory was helpful because it could well predict values on the new vehicle side of the competitive lift if you will. It's – as I mentioned earlier, it's slow and methodical, don't feel like you need to use it all of our time. If we feel like there will be an overstock for the full year, do you have that full year decline is essentially happening within Q1. In terms of the purchase tax – so in Europe, there's a significant component of petrol sales relative to diesel, so it doesn't make – it's not multiple pounds on our market shares, it's more a question of what the rebound in the market will be, the sort of shift in the consumer's preferred to petrol. A lot of speculation in terms of the inventory, interest rates – I don’t see that the – and especially as it relates to the used vehicle residuals, the next few years because – at least from your indicators that we're seeing could be – be helpful because it could worsen values which would help in the impact on the discretionary cash flow from incomes to buy new vehicles. Let me just add to that my dislike of that particular topic. And also, let me just add, that that topic is just basic, from the whole company emphasize its outsourced to – Indian teams, so that's an extra layer of an issue that we have to add into the cost equation. So already increased which was in the plans of the corporation, but we're now pushing those into the quarter. And I will just finish with the statement, I'm not sure if I like the U.S. Financial laws that squeeze the auto industry from all directions. But, you won’t get any newsletters from us. Thank you, everyone.
