. So we're well-prepared for the recall costs and we have factored them into our outlook for the full year. In terms of the retail share, the higher warranty expense is related to the effect of recalls, but we've reserved for it and we are managing it appropriately. So overall, we are comfortable with our position and we don't see any significant impact on our outlook for the full year based on these factors. Thank you. 

In conclusion, after closely analyzing the company's recent earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that the company has shown improvement in various financial metrics, including adjusted EPS, automotive segment profit, and automotive cash flow. The favorable performance in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, coupled with the profitable results in Ford Credit, suggests a positive outlook for the company. The company's ability to manage costs, navigate through uncertain market conditions, and prepare for potential risks, such as recall expenses, demonstrates its resilience. Therefore, we believe that the company presents an attractive investment opportunity and recommend an 'overweight' stance for investors. Thank you.
