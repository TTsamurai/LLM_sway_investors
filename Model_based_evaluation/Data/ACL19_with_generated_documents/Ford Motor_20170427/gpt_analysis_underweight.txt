Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that the company is facing challenges across multiple regions and segments. The decline in profitability, unfavorable cost performance, and lower volumes are all key factors influencing the company's financial performance. The company's automotive division saw a decline in profit, with unfavorable costs and lower volume being major contributors to this decline. The company's European division also experienced lower profitability, due to higher costs associated with new launches and recalls.

Additionally, the company is expecting a decline of roughly $1.4 billion in pre-tax profit compared to the previous year. This decline is partially attributed to the cancellation charges associated with the cancellation of a plant in Mexico, as well as the company's European restructuring actions. The company's market share in North America and China has also declined, further impacting their financial performance and outlook for the future.

Moreover, the company's adjusted effective tax rate came in at 28.6% for the quarter, which was better than the previous year but consistent with the full-year guidance of about 30%. The company also reported an adjusted EPS of $0.39, which was higher than previously guided due to favorable timing of cost performance and wholesale volume, particularly in North America.

In terms of Ford Credit, the company is maintaining a disciplined and consistent approach to managing its portfolio metrics, such as FICO scores and delinquencies, amidst concerns about auto financing in the broader industry. The company has stated that it expects its results to improve in 2018 as a result of less supplemental depreciation, and as of now, the portfolio is performing in line with expectations.

Overall, considering the decline in profitability and market share across various segments, along with the impact of recall charges and unfavorable cost performance, I would recommend adopting an 'underweight' investment stance in relation to the company's future outlook. Continued challenges and uncertainties in various regions and segments indicate potential risks to the company's financial performance in the near future.
