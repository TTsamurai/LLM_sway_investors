. So that's a little bit about how the recall actually works and how it has the potential to flow through. And it's one of the reasons why, as a result of that, in particular, we priced the recall, just to be clear. That pricing is done right from the very beginning. All of those vehicles that I was talking, we reserve and price accordingly. I think the one thing that was also interesting was that when you listen to the detail of the recall, it's largely around the recalls that we've done in the second and third quarter of this year. They are really related to the cost associated with finding a customer, bringing them in, how we compensate that customer or if the customer has to rent a car, how we pay it. It's really about the operational actions that we have to undertake as opposed to the actual work that takes place to do the fix.
