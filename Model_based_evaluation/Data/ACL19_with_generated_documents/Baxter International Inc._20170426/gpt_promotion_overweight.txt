The company reported a 4% growth in sales on a reported basis and 5% growth on a constant currency basis. The company's operational sales rose by 7%, reflecting strength across its U.S. businesses as well as growth in peritoneal dialysis, acute renal therapies, and nutrition globally. Adjusted earnings were reported at $0.58 per diluted share, reflecting solid execution and sustained momentum in business transformation efforts. The Hospital Products business saw a 10% operational sales growth, driven by strength in Fluid Systems and increased demand for nutritional therapies and drugs. The Surgical Care business also saw strong growth, with sales increasing by 11% operationally, driven by strong U.S. growth for anesthesia and critical care products. The Renal business reported a 2% operational sales growth globally, with peritoneal dialysis achieving mid-single digit growth and the acute renal business delivering solid mid-single digit growth.
