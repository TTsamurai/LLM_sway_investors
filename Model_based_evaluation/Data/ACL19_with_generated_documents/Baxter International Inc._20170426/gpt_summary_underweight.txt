Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is advisable to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on Baxter International. While the company has reported strong sales growth of 4% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis in the first quarter of 2017, there are some key financial metrics to consider.

The adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.58, reflecting solid execution on the top line, as well as sustained momentum of the business transformation efforts. However, it is noted that the company is facing challenges, particularly in the Renal business, where in-center hemodialysis globally experienced a mid-single digit decline, mainly due to continued competitive pressures on dialysis. This is impacting the overall growth profile of the company.

The acquisition of Claris Injectables and the strategic agreement with ScinoPharm are expected to expand the company's marketed portfolio and pipeline. However, it is important to consider that the company is preparing to launch several proprietary premixed injectable molecules in 2017 through its internal research and development pipeline, which may involve significant costs and risks.

In terms of market expansion, while the company is confident about its growth potential, particularly in the generic injectable space and biosimilars, it is clear that these programs take a significant amount of time and may not have an immediate impact on the top line growth until the end of 2018 or 2019.

The company's management also expressed confidence in pursuing potential acquisitions, which could impact the balance sheet and borrowing capability. While the company is actively evaluating inorganic opportunities, it is important to consider the risks and uncertainties associated with such deals.

The company's international performance is mixed, with strong growth in some regions but underperformance in others, particularly in Europe. The ongoing efforts to replace management and extend product line offerings in underperforming regions may require significant investment and time.

Overall, while Baxter International has reported some positive financial metrics, there are several challenges and uncertainties that may impact its growth and profitability in the near term. Therefore, it is advisable to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance until there is more clarity on the company's ability to overcome these challenges and drive sustained top quartile performance.
