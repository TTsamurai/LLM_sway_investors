---

#### **1. Overall Performance Overview:**
Baxter International reported a solid performance for the first quarter of 2017 with a 4% sales growth on a reported basis and a 5% growth on a constant currency basis. Operational sales, adjusted for certain factors, increased by 7%. The adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.58.

**Focus Areas:**
- **Hospital Products:** Achieved $1.6 billion in sales with a 10% operational increase, driven by Fluid Systems and Integrated Pharma Solutions (IPS).
- **Renal Business:** Reported $896 million in sales with a 2% operational increase. Notable growth in peritoneal dialysis contrasted by challenges in in-center hemodialysis, particularly in Europe.
- **Surgical Care:** Showed an 11% operational increase, primarily due to strong U.S. demand for anesthesia and biosurgery products.

**Strategic Highlights:**
- Acquisition of Claris Injectables and a strategic agreement with ScinoPharm for cancer treatments.
- Launch expectations for premixed injectable molecules from internal R&D.
- Investments in technology and R&D such as the PRISMAX for acute care and new tissue expander, DERMACLOSE.

- **Investments and Acquisitions:** Focus on expanding presence in the generic injectable space, with acquisitions and strategic agreements expected to enhance the product portfolio.
- **Operational Challenges:** Decline in in-center hemodialysis activities, primarily in the European market, raises concerns over operational efficiencies and market competitiveness.

#### **3. Future Guidance and Strategic Outlook:**
- **Projections:** Projection of sustained top quartile performance was based on current strategic executions. However, caution is advised given operational challenges particularly in Europe.
- **Growth Opportunities:** Emphasis on growth through innovations like AMIA in PD and the PRISMAX system in acute care settings. Also, a significant eye is set on expanding in the generic injectables and potentially in biosimilars.
- **Efficiency Measures:** Continuation in improving cost structures and efficiencies across operations, with detailed plans to leverage acquisitions like Claris for enhanced growth.

---

#### **4. Risks and Concerns:**
- **Competitive Market Pressures:** Notably in the European Renal sector, the ongoing competition and price pressures could restrict profitability and market share.
- **Integration Risks:** Challenges associated with integrating acquisitions like Claris Injectables, which needs close tracking to ensure expected synergies and performances are realized.
- **Market Sensitivity:** Higher sensitivity to market disruptions and regulatory changes, particularly significant in healthcare sectors.

---

#### **5. Investment Stance Justification:**
Given the challenges noted particularly in margins in certain business sectors, ongoing competitive pressures, and potential integration risks from acquisitions, adopting an 'underweight' stance is advisable. Investors should monitor forthcoming quarterly performances for signs of improved operational efficiencies and successful integration of strategic initiatives like acquisitions and new product launches. The ability to navigate challenges in the European market will be particularly telling of the company's resilience and capability to sustain projected growth trajectories.

**Conclusion:** While Baxter exhibits strong aspects in innovation and strategic growth initiatives, current vulnerabilities and operational inefficiencies, especially within the European markets, suggest a cautious investment approach. 

**Recommendation:** Maintain a vigilant approach, focusing on quarterly performance metrics and progress in strategic initiatives as potential catalysts for reassessment of investment stance.
