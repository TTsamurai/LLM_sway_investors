Sysco's recent earnings conference call highlight solid operating performance despite temporary headwinds such as hurricanes, rising inflation, and challenging inbound freight.

Despite challenges, the company's approach to category management, revenue management efforts, and balanced pricing has contributed to gross profit dollar growth.

Additionally, the company has seen a 2.8% growth in local case growth for 14 consecutive quarters, with continued focus on profitability with multi-unit customers. Sysco's Supplier community and digital ordering presence continues to grow, showing increased utilization and efficiency.

Despite challenges faced in the first quarter, Sysco aims to deliver on its adjusted operating income growth target of $600 to $650 million and is confident in its trajectory for fiscal 2018.
