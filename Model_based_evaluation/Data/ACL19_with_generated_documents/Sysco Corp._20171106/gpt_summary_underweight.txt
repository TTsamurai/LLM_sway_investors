. It's interesting to note that Sysco is experiencing solid operating performance despite temporary headwinds such as hurricanes impacting customers, rising inflation, and challenging inbound freight environment. The U.S. Foodservice Operations segment saw sales and gross profit growth of 3.9% and 3.8% respectively, with local case growth remaining strong at 2.8% and multi-unit customer segment declining. Sysco is investing in its Sysco Brand as part of a larger brand revitalization effort, contributing to brand growth and innovation.

On the International Foodservice Operations front, there were mixed results with sales growing 6%, gross profit 3%, and adjusted operating expenses increasing 5%, leading to an overall adjusted operating income decline of 8% for the quarter. The UK market is experiencing macroeconomic headwinds with slower restaurant traffic and high food cost inflation at about 9%. The Latin American market also faced challenges due to recent earthquakes in Mexico City and expenses related to the addition of a large customer in Mexico.

In terms of investments, Sysco acquired HFM FoodService, a Hawaii-based broadline distributor, and completed the purchase of the remaining 50% of the Mayca business in Costa Rica.

Despite these challenges, Sysco remains confident in its ability to deliver the high end of its adjusted operating income growth target of $600 to $650 million.

However, from a financial analyst's perspective, it is important to note that the company is facing several challenges in the form of inflation, macroeconomic headwinds, and mixed results in the international market. These factors could impact the company's future financial performance. Due to these challenges, an 'underweight' investment stance may be advisable until the company demonstrates more robust and sustainable growth in the face of these headwinds.
