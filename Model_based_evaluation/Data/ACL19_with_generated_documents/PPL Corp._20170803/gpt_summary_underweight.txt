In analyzing the recent earnings conference call transcript for PPL, we have identified several key financial metrics that indicate a decrease in earnings compared to the previous year. The reported earnings for the second quarter of 2017 were $0.43 per share, compared to $0.71 per share in the same period of 2016. Similarly, year-to-date reported earnings were $1.01 per share, compared to $1.41 per share in the first half of 2016. Adjusting for special items, second quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.52 per share, compared to $0.56 per share a year ago. Lower foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted second quarter of 2017 earnings from ongoing operations by $0.07 per share, compared to 2016. The remaining quarterly increase in earnings from ongoing operations of $0.03 per share was due to lower operating and maintenance expenses in Kentucky and in the U.K.

Looking at the annual forecast, PPL is reaffirming its 2017 ongoing earnings forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share, with the midpoint of $2.15 per share. However, the earnings for the Kentucky segment are projected to be lower due to lower electricity sales volumes caused by unfavorable weather, while the U.K. Regulated segment earnings are expected to be stronger for the year.

From a long-term perspective, PPL expects 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2017 through 2020, with a target annual dividend growth of about 4% a year through 2020. The company is also planning to invest more than $13 billion in infrastructure through 2020.

In addition to the financial metrics, it is important to note that the company continues to prioritize customer satisfaction and has been recognized for superior customer service in both the U.S. and the U.K. Furthermore, PPL's U.K. subsidiary is actively engaged in the Ofgem's RIIO-2 consultation process, which will shape the regulatory framework for the future.

Based on the information provided in the conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance with regards to PPL. The decrease in earnings and the challenges presented by unfavorable weather and foreign currency exchange rates suggest potential risks for shareholders. Additionally, the ongoing regulatory consultations in the U.K. may lead to uncertain outcomes for the company's operations in that market. Therefore, a cautious approach is advisable for investors considering PPL as an investment option.
