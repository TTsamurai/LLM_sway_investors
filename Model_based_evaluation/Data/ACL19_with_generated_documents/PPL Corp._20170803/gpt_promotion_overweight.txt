Based on the recent earnings call of the company, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance. Here are some key points:

- PPL reported lower earnings for the quarter and year-to-date compared to 2016, primarily due to lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017. However, adjusting for special items, earnings from ongoing operations were in line with expectations.
- Despite the lower earnings, PPL reaffirmed its 2017 ongoing earnings forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share, with a projected 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2017 through 2020.
- The company's U.K. Regulated segment is expected to come in stronger for the year, with lower operating and maintenance expenses and lower income taxes driving higher earnings.
- In the U.K., Ofgem initiated a consultation process to construct a framework for RIIO-2, which is expected to provide fair returns for share owners and good value for consumers, while incentivizing companies to drive value, innovation, and efficiency.
- PPL's U.K. segment has been successful in navigating through new price controls in the past, mitigating revenue resets and achieving earnings growth.

Overall, PPL remains on track to deliver on its 2017 earnings forecast and is confident in its ability to deliver compound annual earnings growth. The company's U.K. segment is expected to perform well, and it has a history of successfully navigating regulatory frameworks. Therefore, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on PPL based on its strong potential for growth and resilience in the face of regulatory changes.
