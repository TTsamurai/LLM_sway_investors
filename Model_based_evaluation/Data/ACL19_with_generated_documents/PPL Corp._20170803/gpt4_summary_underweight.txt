# **PPL Corporation Earnings Report Analysis**

## Summary and Recommendation:
Upon reviewing PPL Corporation's recent earnings conference call transcription for the first half of 2017, a number of critical financial metrics and business developments have been identified that may influence an investment stance. Given the current financial indicators and future expectations discussed during the call, there is a recommendation to maintain an 'underweight' stance on PPL Corporation investments at this time.

## Key Financial Metrics Analysis:
- **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**:
  - **Q2 2017 Reported**: $0.43, a decrease from $0.71 in Q2 2016.
  - **Year-to-Date 2017 Reported**: $1.01, down from $1.41 in 2016.
  - **2017 Ongoing Earnings Forecast**: $2.05 to $2.25 per share; midpoint $2.15.

- **Factors Impacting EPS**:
  - **Foreign Currency Exchange**: Negatively impacted Q2 earnings by $0.07 per share and $0.17 per share year-to-date.
  - **Operating Expenses**: Lower operating expenses contributed positively by increasing ongoing operations EPS by $0.08 year-to-date.

- **Revenue Adjustments**:
  - **Kentucky Utility Operations**: Adjusted rate increase of $116 million beginning Q3 2017, likely impacting future revenue positively. The adjustment in ongoing earnings projection for Kentucky to $0.56 for the year primarily due to lower electricity sales volume.
  - **UK Operations**: Stronger projection at $1.20 per share for the year, helped by reduced operating expenses and taxes.

## Strategic and Operational Highlights:
- **Capital Expenditures and Projects**: 
  - Over $13 billion planned in infrastructure investments through 2020.
  - Significant progress in the Smart Grid capabilities enhancement and meter replacements in Pennsylvania.

- **Regulatory Environment**:
  - Regulatory developments such as RIIO-2 process in the UK are in early stages but pivotal for long-term strategic adjustments and earnings impacts.

- **Risk Factors**:
  - **Projected Growth**: Despite a strong operational focus, the stated ongoing earnings forecast growth and dividend growth projections (4-6% annual EPS growth, 4% dividend growth) may not sufficiently mitigate the ongoing and potential future currency and regulatory risks.
  - **Utility Sector Volatility and Regulatory Changes**: Potential adjustments in regulatory frameworks (RIIO-2 and middle-year reviews) could introduce financial instability.
  - **Weather and Sales Volume Variability**: As noted from the underperformance in Kentucky linked to unfavorable weather impacting sales volumes.

## Conclusion:
PPL Corporation's financial performance in the first half of 2017 shows a decrease in both quarterly and year-to-date earnings per share compared to 2016, which is a cause for considerable caution. Combined with looming regulatory uncertainties in the UK and apparent vulnerability to fluctuating weather conditions, the risk profile of the investment appears elevated.

The reaffirmation of the earnings forecast and the strategic capital investment might suggest underlying strength, yet the presence of these considerable uncertainties supports an underweight stance, favoring a cautious approach until clearer signs of stable growth and minimized risks emerge.
