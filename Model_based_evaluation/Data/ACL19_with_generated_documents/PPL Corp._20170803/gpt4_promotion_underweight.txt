### Investment Report: Underweight Recommendation for PPL Corporation

#### Overview

After thorough analysis of PPL Corporation’s recent earnings call and reviewing the accompanying financial documents, I advise an underweight position in PPL’s portfolio. Despite the corporation's optimistic presentation of its potential growth and its stable dividends, several areas of concern need to be highlighted which underpin this recommendation.

#### Earnings Performance Concerns

1. **Decline in Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: PPL has reported a consistent decline in earnings per share, where the year-to-date EPS fell from $1.41 in 2016 to $1.01 in 2017, which signals a downward trend in profitability. This is primarily attributed to adverse foreign currency exchange rates and potentially stagnant or declining base revenue figures.

2. **Impact of Foreign Exchange**: The company has notably been impacted by lower foreign currency exchange rates, which decreased earnings by approximately $0.17 per share year-to-date compared to the previous year. Such exposure to foreign exchange volatility introduces additional risk to the earnings stability.

#### Regulatory and Market Risks

1. **Regulatory Uncertainties in the U.K.**: The ongoing RIIO-2 process led by Ofgem to determine future price controls could impose stricter regulations affecting profitability. While PPL views this as a constructive opportunity, the uncertainty around the outcomes of such regulatory changes poses a risk to future earnings.

2. **Unfavorable Weather Conditions and Sale Volumes**: The Kentucky segment’s recent performance was negatively affected by unfavorable weather, leading to reduced electricity sales volumes. Although rate increases have been authorized, the volume-based revenue is susceptible to environmental factors that might not always align with predictive modeling.

#### Strategic and Operational Concerns

1. **Limited Revenue Growth Visibility**: Despite confirmed rate increases and infrastructure investments, the revised lower ongoing earnings projection for the Kentucky segment points to challenges in achieving significant growth in core operational areas.

2. **Dependency on Regulated Market Conditions**: A large portion of PPL’s revenue is derived from regulated markets, both in the U.S. and the U.K. While this provides some income stability, it also limits the company’s flexibility to rapidly adapt and scale operations in response to market changes.

#### Dividend and Investment Considerations

1. **Dividend Sustainability**: Although PPL continues to target an annual dividend growth of approximately 4% through 2020, the practical sustainability of these dividends is contingent upon the company’s ability to reverse the declining EPS trend and effectively manage regulatory risks.

2. **Future Investments and ROI**: The planned $13 billion in infrastructure investment through 2020 should theoretically position the company for future growth. However, given the current earnings pressures and regulatory uncertainties, the expected return on these investments and their impact on shareholder value remain uncertain.

#### Conclusion

Given these factors—particularly the consistent decline in earnings per share, regulatory uncertainties, and the overall challenging operational environment—an underweight stance is recommended for investors considering PPL Corporation in their portfolios. It is advisable for potential investors to seek opportunities with more stable earnings outlooks and lower regulatory risks.
