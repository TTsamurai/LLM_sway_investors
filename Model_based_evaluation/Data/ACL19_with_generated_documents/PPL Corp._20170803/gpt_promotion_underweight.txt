 Based on the information provided during the earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on PPL Corporation. The reported earnings for the quarter and year-to-date are lower compared to 2016, as expected, primarily driven by lower foreign currency exchange rates in 2017. The ongoing earnings projection for the year has been revised for the Kentucky segment due to lower electricity sales volumes, and while the U.K. segment is expected to come in stronger for the year, the forecast for 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth through 2020 seems optimistic. Additionally, there are uncertainties surrounding the regulatory framework in the U.K., particularly with the RIIO-2 process and the potential for a mid-year review for RIIO-ED1. These factors contribute to a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company's future performance. It is advisable to proceed with caution when considering an investment in PPL Corporation.
