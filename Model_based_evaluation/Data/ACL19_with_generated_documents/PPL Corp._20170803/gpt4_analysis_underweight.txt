### PPL Corporation: Underweight Investment Stance

#### Overview:
PPL Corporation's recent earnings call highlighted several key elements that are pertinent to our analysis and investment stance. Notably, the company has experienced a decrement in earnings per share (EPS) both quarterly and year-to-date, primarily driven by lower foreign currency exchange rates. While PPL reaffirmed its earnings guidance for 2017 and projected steady growth through 2020, several concerns justify an 'underweight' investment recommendation.

#### Financial Performance Analysis:
1. **Earnings Comparison:**
   - **2017 Q2 Reported Earnings:** $0.43 per share compared to $0.71 in 2016 Q2.
   - **Year-to-Date Reported Earnings:** $1.01 per share compared to $1.41 in the previous year.
   - **Ongoing Operations Earnings:**
     - 2017 Q2: $0.52 per share, a decrease from $0.56 in 2016 Q2.
     - Lower foreign currency exchange rates had a significant negative impact, detracting $0.07 per share in Q2 2017 versus the previous year.

2. **Impact of Exchange Rates:** The negative effect of foreign currency exchange rates is significant, highlighting PPL's sensitivity to international financial markets, which adds an element of uncertainty to future earnings.

3. **Operational Expenses and Segment Performance:**
   - Positive developments noted in lowered operational and maintenance expenses particularly in the U.K., and lower income taxes aiding the U.K. segment's earnings.
   - Unfavorable weather in Kentucky adversely impacting sales volumes and earnings, thus potentially indicating vulnerability to uncontrollable external factors.

#### Regulatory and Operational Risks:
1. **Regulatory Changes (RIIO-2 Framework in the U.K.):**
   - Changes in regulatory frameworks could pose risks to profitability, depending on the new stipulations of the RIIO-2 framework which begins in April 2023.
   - Early engagement in the consultation process and strategic planning for RIIO-2 are positive, but outcomes remain uncertain.

2. **Capital Expenditures and Investments:**
   - Planned infrastructure investments exceeding $13 billion through 2020 signifies robust growth strategy but also entails significant financial commitments.
   - Adjustments in Kentucky utility operations due to rate case outcomes and changes in forecasted ROI could impact short-term financial health.

3. **Utility Operations and Adjustments:**
   - Smart Grid enhancements and meter replacements are forward-looking investments that should improve service reliability and operational efficiency.
   - Dependency on regulatory decisions for revenue and financial adjustments needs to be watched as they pose both opportunities and risks.

#### Market Position and Competition:
- Noted achievements in customer satisfaction and operational efficiency help maintain a strong competitive position in the markets PPL operates.
- However, the utilities sector is highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology and consumer expectations.

#### Dividend and Growth Prospects:
- Annual dividend growth targeted at about 4% through 2020 aligns with industry standards but might not be attractive for growth-oriented investors.
- The projected 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth rate looks optimistic given the current challenges and potential regulatory uncertainties.

#### Recommendation:
Given the above analysis, an 'underweight' stance on PPL Corporation is advisable. The company faces significant headwinds due to foreign exchange rate dependencies, regulatory changes in the U.K., and potentially volatile weather impacts on operational performance. While the management demonstrates a solid strategic direction, current financial metrics and future uncertainties suggest limited upside potential relative to risks. Investors should maintain cautious positions and closely monitor forthcoming regulatory and financial updates from the company.
