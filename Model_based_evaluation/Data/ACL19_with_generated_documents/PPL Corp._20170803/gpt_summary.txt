As a financial analyst, I would summarize the key financial metrics highlighted in the earnings conference call transcript as follows:

1. Earnings per share: The reported earnings for the second quarter of 2017 were $0.43 per share, compared to $0.71 per share in the same period in 2016. Year-to-date reported earnings were $1.01 per share, compared to $1.41 per share through the first half of 2016. Adjusting for special items, second quarter 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.52 per share, compared with $0.56 per share a year ago.

2. Impact of foreign currency exchange rates: Lower foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted earnings from ongoing operations by $0.07 per share in the second quarter of 2017 and by $0.17 per share year-to-date 2017.

3. Segment breakdown: The Kentucky segment ongoing earnings projection for 2017 was revised to $0.56 for the year, primarily due to lower electricity sales volumes due to unfavorable weather. Earnings for the U.K. regulated segment were projected to be stronger for the year, with a projection of $1.20 per share due to lower operating and maintenance expenses and lower income taxes.

4. Forecast and growth: The company reaffirmed its 2017 ongoing earnings forecast of $2.05 to $2.25 per share, with a midpoint of $2.15 per share. They also expect 5% to 6% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2017 through 2020, as well as annual dividend growth of about 4% a year through 2020.

5. Rate increase and investments: The Kentucky Public Service Commission authorized a combined rate increase of $116 million for Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas and Electric, with a 9.7% return on equity. The company continues to expect 5% to 6% compound annual earnings growth range through 2020 and plans to invest more than $13 billion in infrastructure through 2020.

6. Customer satisfaction and operational updates: The company's domestic utilities ranked high in customer satisfaction, and the U.S. Utilities won a combined 45 J.D. Power awards. In the U.K., the regulator Ofgem issued an open letter seeking feedback on its RIIO-2 process, and the company remains confident in navigating new price controls and preparing for potential changes to the framework.

These key financial metrics reflect the company's performance and outlook, including factors such as earnings, currency exchange rates, segment breakdown, forecasts, rate increases, investments, customer satisfaction, and regulatory developments.
