**Future Outlook Report: Aon Plc**

**Investment Stance: Overweight**

As a financial analyst, I have carefully reviewed the transcripts from Aon’s Q3 2017 earnings conference call and conducted a thorough analysis of the company’s financial metrics and strategic initiatives. Based on the insights derived, I recommend an overweight investment stance on Aon. Here’s a comprehensive breakdown of the key factors supporting this recommendation:

### 1. Consistent Organic Growth
Aon has reported a consistent increase in organic revenue growth, progressing from 2% in 2015 to 3% in both 2016 and 2017. This acceleration is indicative of Aon’s strengthening market presence and effective client engagement across its diversified portfolio. Specifically, in Q3 2017, notable organic growth was observed in the Reinsurance Solutions (7%) and Retirement Solutions (5%), driven by significant new business generation and strong demand for Aon's tailored services.

### 2. Strategic Divestitures and Acquisitions
Earlier in the year, Aon completed the divestiture of its outsourcing platform, liberating approximately $3 billion of capital. This capital is being strategically reinvested to drive emerging client needs and strengthen the Aon United operating model. The firm is not only focusing on organic growth but also enhancing its capabilities through targeted acquisitions—such as Townsend Group and Admix—expanding their service offerings in real estate investment, health, and elective benefits brokerage.

### 3. Margin Expansion and Robust Financial Performance
Aon reported a significant improvement in its operating margin, which increased by 170 basis points in Q3, reflecting both operational efficiency gains from the Aon United model and effective capital management. Earnings per share (EPS) grew by 18% to $1.29, signifying strong operating leverage and adept financial stewardship.

### 4. High Growth in High-Margin Areas
The company’s investment in high-margin areas, such as Data & Analytics and cyber risk advisory services, is fostering an improved growth profile. Initiatives like these not only enhance Aon’s service capability but also improve revenue quality and profitability.

### 5. Proactive Client and Community Support
Amidst significant global socio-economic pressures, including catastrophic events, Aon demonstrated robust support to both communities and clients, showcasing strong corporate citizenship and resilience. This aspect, while ethically commendable, also strengthens client loyalty and corporate reputation—a crucial asset in the services industry.

### 6. Future Growth Potential
With Q3 traditionally being Aon’s weakest quarter followed by a stronger Q4, the solid performance in Q3 sets a positive trajectory for closing the year. The management’s commentary reveals confidence in the continued momentum backed by strategic investments poised to drive the next wave of client-focused innovations.

### Risk Considerations
Despite the optimistic outlook, potential risks include the volatile global economic climate and the inherent uncertainties associated with strategic acquisitions, which could affect integration and anticipated synergy realization. Furthermore, the evolving regulatory landscape, particularly in data security and privacy (critical for their data-centric growth pillars), could pose compliance risks.

### Conclusion
Considering Aon’s strategic alignment, robust financial health, commitment to innovation, and consistent performance even in adverse conditions, the outlook for Aon remains positive. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities, thereby generating substantial value for shareholders. Investors should consider increasing their holdings, reflecting an overweight stance in anticipation of continued success and market share growth.
