Based on the provided transcript of Clorox's Second Quarter Conference Call, the financial performance of the company shows positive signs. Key financial metrics to focus on, in order to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance, may include the following:

1. Volume and Sales Growth: The company reported strong volume growth of 8% and sales growth of 5%, which was the highest in four years. However, it should be noted that the sales growth was partially offset by continuing unfavorable foreign exchange rates.

2. Profit Margins: While the call did not explicitly provide specific profit margin figures, it is important to analyze the company's ability to retain a competitive margin in the face of cost pressures and currency fluctuations.

3. Market Share: Clorox reported a 1/10th of a point increase in market share in U.S. tracked channels, indicating positive performance in the market. However, it's important to assess if this growth is sustainable in the face of competition and changing consumer preferences.

4. Product Innovation: The call highlighted the company's efforts in new product launches, such as Clorox Scentiva, Clorox Fuzion, and Burt's Bees lip and face line innovations. Evaluating the success and potential impact of these new products is essential.

5. International Performance: Clorox's international sales decreased by 2%, excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign currency. It's crucial to assess the company's ability to navigate currency challenges and sustain growth in international markets amidst economic uncertainties.

Based on the mentioned financial metrics and the company's outlook, adopting an 'underweight' investment stance would involve a cautious approach, with a focus on potential risks associated with currency fluctuations, consumer preferences, and competitive pressures. It is important to analyze the company's ability to maintain growth momentum and profitability in the face of these challenges.
