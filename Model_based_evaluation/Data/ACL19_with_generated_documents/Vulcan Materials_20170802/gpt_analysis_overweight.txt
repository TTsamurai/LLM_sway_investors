 and for taking the time to join our call today. We're confident in the outlook for the company and are excited about the potential for growth and success in the coming years. Based on the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, it is clear that there are several positive indicators for the company's future performance.

Firstly, despite some challenges faced in the recent quarter, there are strong underlying demand trends in the markets served by the company. Public construction activity is showing signs of improvement, with more highway project tons in backlog than in the past three years.

Furthermore, the private non-residential sector is also experiencing growth, with starts increasing by 8% compared to a year ago. This market outperformance in starts growth is a positive sign for future business potential.

The company also reported record unit margins in Aggregates, with a positive pricing climate that resulted in a 6% increase in pricing for the quarter. The cash margin per ton in aggregates improved by 7%, indicating strong financial performance despite challenging conditions.

Additionally, the company's acquisitions, particularly the Aggregates USA acquisition, are expected to drive operational and cost synergies that will benefit the company's overall performance.

From a financial perspective, the company's performance in concrete markets, particularly in Northern Virginia and Texas, has resulted in significant margin improvement. Overall, the company has shown resilience and strategic planning to address challenges and capitalize on opportunities for growth.

Based on the positive outlook provided in the transcript, I recommend taking an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The strong demand trends, positive pricing climate, and potential for synergies from acquisitions all indicate a favorable outlook for the company's future performance.
