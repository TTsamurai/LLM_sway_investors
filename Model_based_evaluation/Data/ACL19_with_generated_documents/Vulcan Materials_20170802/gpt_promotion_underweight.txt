Based on the company's recent earnings call, there are several factors to consider before making an investment decision. While the company reported record unit margins in Aggregates and a positive pricing climate, there are concerns about aggregate shipments being hit hard by rough weather and specific circumstances in certain regions, such as Illinois and Coastal Texas. 

The company has lowered its outlook for aggregate shipments for the year and there are concerns about variable shipment results across different geographies. The shortfall in aggregate volumes drove a gap between the reported results and expectations for the quarter. 

While there are positive indicators for future growth, such as a turn in public construction activity, growing project backlogs, and strong underlying demand trends, it is important to note that these indicators are contradicted by the negative impact on shipments seen in the recent quarter. 

Additionally, despite the positive outlook for the company's recent acquisition of Aggregates USA, it is still too early to speculate on potential divestments and the impact of the acquisition on the company's overall performance. 

In conclusion, considering the cautious perspective on the company's recent earnings call, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance until there is more clarity on the impact of these factors on the company's future performance.
