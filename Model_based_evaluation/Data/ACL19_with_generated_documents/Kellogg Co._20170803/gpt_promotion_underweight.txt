As a stock promoter, based on the company's recent earnings call, I would recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on Kellogg North America. While there are areas of growth, such as the improvement in sales performance in businesses like Specialty Channels, Frozen Foods, and the Kashi Company, there are also concerns, particularly in the Morning Foods segment. The company expressed disappointment in the top-line performance of Morning Foods, specifically in the cereal and toaster pastry categories, which have not returned to last year's rates. The company acknowledges the need to drive these categories and plans to do so in the second half of the year. Additionally, the transition from direct store delivery (DSD) to warehouse distribution presents executional and competitive risks, as well as potential impact on net sales. While there is optimism for margin expansion, there is a cautious approach to ensuring the productivity efforts do not inhibit return to growth. Overall, the mixed performance of the company's segments and the risks associated with the transition to warehouse distribution warrant a cautious approach to investing in Kellogg North America.
