Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that Kellogg North America has shown sequential improvement in net sales, operating profit, and operating profit margin. The company is also on track to meet its 2018 targets, with a focus on driving top-line growth and realizing good margin expansion driven by productivity.

The transition of U.S. Snacks into warehouse distribution is nearly complete, and the company has successfully completed all customer negotiations, finalized SKU rationalizations, and is seeing improved on-shelf availability. The company is also ramping up brand-building and in-store activation to drive top-line growth in this segment.

In contrast, U.S. Morning Foods top-line performance was disappointing in the recent quarter, but the company expects sequential improvement in the second half. The company plans to focus on taste-oriented brands like Froot Loops and Frosted Flakes, as well as launch new products like Special K Nourish with probiotics to drive growth in the adult health-oriented segment.

The Specialty Channels business delivered an eighth consecutive quarter of sales and profit growth, with strong operating profit margin improvement driven by better price/mix and continued savings from cost-saving initiatives.

In the North America Other segment, the Kashi Company and Canada are both showing signs of improvement in top-line performance, while the Frozen category is back in growth and picking up momentum.

Overall, the company is optimistic about the future outlook, with consistent progress and sequential improvement. The company's transition from DSD to warehouse distribution is on track, and it is confident that it will come out with a faster-growing, more profitable U.S. Snacks business. The focus on health and wellness credentials, brand-building, and in-store activation is expected to drive growth across segments.

Based on this analysis, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for Kellogg North America, in anticipation of continued sequential improvement and future growth in the company's performance.
