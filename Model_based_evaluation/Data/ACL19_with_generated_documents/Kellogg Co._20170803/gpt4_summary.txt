### Kellogg North America Earnings Conference Call Summary

- **Financial Impact:** Expected drop in net sales in the short term due to the transition, but enhanced operating profit margins from Q4 due to the reduction in DSD costs.

#### Strategic Focus for H2 and Beyond
- **Brand Building:** Increased investment in the second half to drive demand through brand promotion and collaboration with retail partners.

- **Consumer Engagement:** Tactical Back-to-School programs, fall football, and holiday programs are planned to ramp up engagement and leverage seasonal buying patterns.

### Future Outlook
- **Expectations:** The management is confident in achieving targeted financial outcomes for 2018, with a particular focus on reviving the U.S. Snacks business post-transition and continuing momentum in specialty channels and North America other segments.
- **Long-term Strategic Goals:** Enhance focus on health and wellness across product categories, improve in-store execution, and adapt to changing consumer shopping habits to drive relevance across all brands, especially with millennials and Hispanic demography.

### Conclusion
