Based on the information from the recent earnings conference call transcript of Foot Locker, there are several key insights and financial metrics that lead to an 'underweight' investment stance for the company.

1. Decline in Comparable Sales: The company experienced a decline of 3.7% in third-quarter comparable sales, primarily due to the impact of hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. The negative effects of these natural disasters on sales and inventory losses resulted in a decrease in overall comp by 20 basis points to 40 basis points.

2. Weakness in Footwear Sales: Footwear sales remain challenged, with decreases in men's, women's, and kids' categories. Despite some strong performance in certain categories like running shoes for men, the overall trend in footwear sales is declining.

3. Apparel Strength: On the other hand, apparel sales showed a mid single-digit comparable sales gain, with strong performance in branded fleece, wind wear assortments, and branded T-shirt business.

4. Store Performance: Foot Locker's store divisions in the U.S., Canada, and international markets showed mixed results, with some divisions posting solid results while others experienced comparable sales decline. Overall, traffic at U.S. stores and internationally declined, impacting sales performance.

5. Gross Margin and SG&A Expense: The company's gross margin decreased by 290 basis points to 31% of sales, primarily driven by higher markdowns. SG&A expense rate rose by 30 basis points to 19.7% of sales, including $7 million of hurricane-related expenses.

6. Share Repurchase and Capital Expenditure: Foot Locker significantly accelerated its buyback program, spending $304 million to repurchase 8.7 million shares during the quarter. Capital expenditures for the year are on track to reach almost all of the planned $277 million.

Based on these insights, the company's challenges in footwear sales, store performance, and increased expenses, especially related to natural disasters, indicate a weaker outlook for future performance. The higher markdowns affecting gross margin and the need to maintain relatively high markdowns in Q4 to move through slow-moving inventory could impact profitability. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance may be warranted considering the challenges faced by the company.
