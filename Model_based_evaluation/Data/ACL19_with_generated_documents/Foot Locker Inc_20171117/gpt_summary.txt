. Thank you for providing the earnings conference call transcript. Based on the information provided, here is a detailed summary report focusing on key financial metrics:

1. Comparable Sales: 
- Third quarter comparable sales declined 3.7% due to the impact of hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria on almost 450 stores. Overall, sales recovered within the quarter but the net sales loss primarily due to Hurricane Maria lowered the overall comp by 20 to 40 basis points.

2. Footwear: 
- Footwear sales were challenged and decreased in the mid single-digits, with categories such as men's, kids, and women's all experiencing declines. Running remained the strongest category in men's footwear, with a high single-digit comp gain driven by specific brands.

3. Apparel: 
- Apparel sales were strong, with a mid single-digit comparable sales gain, particularly in men's and children's apparel. Branded fleece and wind wear assortments were key on-trend items during the quarter.

4. Segment Performance: 
- Direct-to-customer sales increased by 6.1%, while store sales declined by 5.1%. Foot Locker Canada and Footaction posted solid results, while stores in the U.S. and internationally experienced declines.

5. Gross Margin: 
- Gross margin decreased by 290 basis points to 31% of sales, driven by a decrease in merchandise margin and higher markdowns to clear slow-moving inventory.

6. SG&A: 
- SG&A expense rate rose by 30 basis points to 19.7% of sales, partially due to $7 million of hurricane-related expenses. Despite this, the team's strong expense management helped offset some of the pressures.

7. Inventory: 
- Inventory decreased by 3.4%, and proactive markdown actions during the quarter helped ensure a healthy inventory going into the holidays.

8. Share Repurchase: 
- The company significantly accelerated its buyback program, repurchasing 8.7 million shares during the quarter and returning $38 million to shareholders through quarterly dividends.

9. Real Estate: 
- The company expects to close 150 stores for the year, open about 90 stores, and relocate or remodel 180 stores.

10. Q4 Expectations: 
- Foot Locker expects comparable sales to decline between 2% to 4% in Q4, with a steeper decline in gross margin and an increase in SG&A as a rate of sales. Overall, EPS is likely to decrease between 15% to 25% in the fourth quarter.

11. Long-Term Growth Initiatives: 
- The company is repositioning itself for long-term growth, focusing on expense management, inventory management, and leveraging assets such as store fleet and vendor partnerships.

In conclusion, while the impact of hurricanes and other challenges have led to declines in comparable sales and gross margin, Foot Locker is actively implementing strategies to address these issues and position itself for long-term growth. The company's proactive approach to managing expenses and inventory, along with initiatives to enhance the customer experience, may contribute to improved performance in the future.
