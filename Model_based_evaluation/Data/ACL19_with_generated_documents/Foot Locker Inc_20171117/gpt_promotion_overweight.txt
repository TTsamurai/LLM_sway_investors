Based on the recent earnings call from Foot Locker, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. Despite the third quarter comparable sales declining 3.7%, this was within the company's guidance and showed improvement from the previous quarter. It is important to note that the sales were negatively impacted by hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, with almost 450 stores being closed at some point during the quarter. The impact of Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was significant, with the estimated sales loss lowering the overall comp by 20 to 40 basis points.

In terms of performance, the footwear category remains challenged, with decreases in men's, women's, and kids' sales. However, there were strong gains in apparel and accessories. The direct-to-customer segment posted a 6.1% increase in sales, and the company's online businesses in the U.S. and Europe were up mid single-digits.

Although there were decreases in gross margin and SG&A expenses, the company's cash and cash equivalents increased by $25 million from the previous year, and they significantly accelerated their buyback program, repurchasing 8.7 million shares during the quarter.

Looking ahead to Q4, Foot Locker expects comparable sales to decline 2% to 4%, with a decrease in gross margin and an increase in SG&A expenses. However, the company is taking initiatives to reposition itself for long-term growth, including a reduction in force and reorganization, as well as a focus on expense management and inventory management to ensure fresh and improving assortments.

Overall, the company's actions and financial position demonstrate the potential for long-term growth and value for shareholders. Therefore, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended based on the recent earnings call from Foot Locker.
