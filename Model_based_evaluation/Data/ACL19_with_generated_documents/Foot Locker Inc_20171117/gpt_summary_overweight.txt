Dear esteemed stakeholders,

In light of the most recent earnings conference call transcript from Foot Locker, we maintain an 'overweight' investment stance. Despite the third quarter comparable sales decline of 3.7%, which was within the company's down 3% to 4% guidance, there are several key financial metrics that point to potential for future growth.

The steady improvement in comp throughout the third quarter, along with a strong mid single-digit comparable sales gain in apparel, indicates resilience in Foot Locker's business. Additionally, the direct-to-customer segment posted a 6.1% increase, showing strength in the digital sales channel.

While challenges remain in the footwear category, particularly in women's and casual styles, Foot Locker's proactive measures in inventory management and markdown actions have positioned the company well for the upcoming holiday season and 2018. The company's ability to maintain cash and cash equivalents of $890 million, as well as its significant share repurchase to return $482 million to shareholders year-to-date, demonstrates financial strength and commitment to creating value for shareholders.

Furthermore, Foot Locker's reorganization and expense management initiatives, despite the $7 million of hurricane-related expenses, highlight the company's focus on driving long-term earnings growth. The reduction in force and reorganization charge, while difficult, positions Foot Locker for future agility and flexibility in a fast-changing retail environment.

In light of the above, we believe Foot Locker presents an attractive investment opportunity and we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the stock.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
