Based on the information from the recent earnings conference call transcript, there are several key insights and financial metrics that support an 'overweight' investment stance for Foot Locker. 

1. Improvement in Comparable Sales: Despite experiencing a decline of 3.7% in third quarter comparable sales, Foot Locker's performance was within the guidance provided and showed improvement over the previous quarter. The impact of hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria contributed to the decline, but sales recovered in affected areas, indicating resilience.

2. Strong Apparel Business: While footwear sales remain challenged with mid to double-digit declines, the apparel segment showed a strong mid single-digit comparable sales gain, with increases across men's, women's, and kids categories. Branded fleece and wind wear assortments from Nike, Adidas, and Champion were key on-trend items during the quarter.

3. Direct-to-Customer Sales Growth: The direct-to-customer segment posted a 6.1% increase in sales, with digital sales in Canada experiencing a strong double-digit rate increase. This indicates a positive shift towards online retail channels.

4. Expense Management and Cost Control: Foot Locker demonstrated a strong expense management culture, successfully offsetting some of the pressures from minimum wage increases and higher healthcare costs. The reduction in force and reorganization initiative was part of a strategy to create a more agile, flexible organization.

5. Share Repurchase and Dividend Return: Foot Locker significantly accelerated its buyback program, repurchasing 8.7 million shares during the quarter and returning $38 million to shareholders through quarterly dividends. This demonstrates confidence in the company's long-term growth potential and commitment to returning value to shareholders.

Based on these insights, Foot Locker's strategic initiatives to manage expenses, drive digital sales, and reposition the company for long-term growth support an 'overweight' investment stance. The company's proactive approach to inventory management and reorganization efforts position it well for potential growth in 2018. Additionally, the acceleration in share repurchases indicates confidence in the value of the company's stock.
