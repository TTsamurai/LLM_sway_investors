Based on the recent earnings call from Foot Locker, there are several reasons to be cautious and skeptical of the company's performance. The third quarter saw a decline in comparable sales, primarily due to the negative impact of hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, as well as inventory losses. Footwear sales were down across categories, especially in women's footwear, where trends weakened further. Apparel sales were strong, but gains in men's and women's apparel were largely mark-down driven. Direct-to-customer sales increased, while store sales declined, with traffic at U.S. and international stores also seeing a decrease. Gross margin and SG&A expense rates both increased, and the company incurred hurricane-related expenses and a reduction in force charge, impacting the income statement. The company also accelerated the buyback program, spending a significant amount to repurchase shares. Additionally, the guidance for Q4 shows an anticipated decline in comparable sales, gross margin, and EPS.

In light of these factors, it would be advisable to recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on Foot Locker. The company is facing challenges in various segments of its business, and the forthcoming quarter's performance is expected to decline. The impact of the hurricanes on sales and inventory, along with increased expenses and the reduction in force charge, are red flags for potential investors. It is important to exercise caution and skepticism when considering an investment in Foot Locker based on the recent earnings call.
