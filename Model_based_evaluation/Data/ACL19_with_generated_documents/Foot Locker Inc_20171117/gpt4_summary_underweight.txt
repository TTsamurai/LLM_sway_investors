### Detailed Summary Report: Earnings Conference Call - Foot Locker, Inc.

**Introduction**  
Foot Locker, Inc. recently held its third-quarter earnings conference call. The company reported a decline in comparable sales by 3.7%, attributing the reduction mainly to hurricanes Maria, Harvey, and Irma.

**Key Financial Metrics**

1. **Comparable Sales:** The decrease of 3.7% in comp sales aligns with the provided guidance. Hurricanes negatively affected the results, reducing overall comp sales by 20 to 40 basis points. This was partially mitigated by a recoveries in Texas and Florida. Notably, Hurricane Maria had a profound impact due to the prolonged closure of all Puerto Rican and Virgin Islands stores.

2. **Performance by Category:**
   - **Footwear:** Experienced a mid single-digit decline. Men's shoes decreased low single-digits, kids' footwear dropped mid single-digits, and women's shoes saw a double-digit decline.
   - **Apparel:** Contrarily, apparel was robust with a mid single-digit comp sales gain, supported by strong sales across men's, women's, and kids categories. Women's gains were largely driven by markdowns.
   - **Accessories:** Comps in this category were down by double digits.

3. **Direct-to-Customer vs. Store Sales:** Direct-to-customer segment rose by 6.1%, now accounting for 13.8% of total sales. Store sales, however, decreased by 5.1%.

4. **Gross Margin:** Gross margin fell by 290 basis points to 31% due to increased markdowns, a slight rise in shipping expenses, and deleverage on occupancy and buyers’ compensation expenses.

5. **SG&A Expenses:** SG&A expense rate increased by 30 basis points to 19.7%. This included $7 million in hurricane-related costs which, if excluded, would have resulted in a 10 basis points leverage.

6. **Net Profit and Earnings per Share (EPS):** Anticipate EPS to decrease by 15% to 25% in Q4. This is due to the operating challenges and higher expected markdowns in Q4. The tax rate observed a significant increase, from 34.7% on a GAAP basis.

7. **Inventory Management:** Inventory was down 3.4% year-over-year. The proactive approach in markdowns has been aligned with making room for newer assortments in the coming holiday season.

8. **Capital Expenditure and Share Repurchases:** The company invested $54 million in capital expenditures during the quarter and completed substantial share repurchases, highlighting the firm’s strategic choice to return value to shareholders.

9. **Real Estate:** Plan to close 150 stores over the year, reflecting an upsurge from previous estimates and signaling a strategic resizing of physical footprint.

### Analyst Commentary: Underweight Stance

Given the significant drops in critical categories such as footwear, coupled with escalating operational costs (e.g., SG&A, tax rate, markdown pressures), and overall declining store-based sales performance, the underweight stance seems justified. While direct-to-customer sales show promise, they might not be sufficient to counterbalance the reduction in-store foot traffic and sales. The guidance indicates continued challenges ahead, particularly with forecasted declines in Q4 comp sales and gross margin. Furthermore, the need for heavy markdowns to manage inventory levels and the increase in store closures may put additional pressure on near-term profitability and operational efficiency.

**Conclusion**

Foot Locker's third-quarter performance and projections for Q4 suggest enduring hurdles that may continue to impact its financial health and market position. Investors are advised to maintain cautious positioning despite the company's efforts in buybacks and digital growth strategies. These factors lead to the recommendation of an 'underweight' investment stance on Foot Locker, Inc., pending more robust turnaround evidence in core areas such as in-store sales and margin recovery.
