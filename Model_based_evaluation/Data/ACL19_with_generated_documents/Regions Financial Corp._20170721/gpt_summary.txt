, based on the information provided in the earnings conference call transcripts, here are the key financial metrics that were discussed:

1. Average Loans: The average loan balances remained relatively stable at $80.1 billion. Consumer production increased by 22%, but this was offset by the company's decision to exit the third-party arrangement within the indirect vehicle portfolio. Excluding this runoff, average consumer loans increased approximately $140 million over the first quarter. Average mortgage balances increased by $168 million, while average home equity balances decreased by $131 million.

2. Deposits: Total average deposits decreased by $478 million, while average low-cost deposits decreased by $335 million. However, total average deposits in the Consumer segment increased by $890 million, reflecting the strength of the retail franchise. Average deposits in the Corporate segment decreased by $581 million, impacted by seasonal declines in public funds deposits. Average deposits in the Wealth Management segment declined by $496 million. The deposit base was emphasized as a key component of the franchise value and a competitive advantage.

3. Net Interest Income: Net interest income on a fully taxable basis was $904 million in the second quarter, an increase of $23 million, or 3% from the first quarter. The net interest margin was 3.32%, an increase of 7 basis points. Net interest margin and net interest income were positively impacted by higher interest rates and favorable credit-related interest recoveries, although they were negatively affected by one additional day in the quarter.

4. Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $15 million, or 3% in the quarter. This was driven primarily by increases in capital markets income and bank-owned life insurance. Mortgage production and servicing income also contributed to non-interest income growth.

5. Expenses: Total non-interest expenses increased by 4% during the quarter. On an adjusted basis, expenses totaled $899 million, an increase of $27 million, or 3% compared to the first quarter. Efforts to manage and optimize the expense base were emphasized, with a focus on people, process, and technology.

6. Asset Quality: Net charge-offs totaled $68 million in the second quarter, representing 34 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan losses was $20 million less than net charge-offs, and the allowance for loan and lease losses declined to 1.3% of total loans outstanding. Non-performing and criticized loans decreased, while total delinquencies also decreased.

7. Capital and Liquidity: The Tier 1 capital ratio was estimated at 12%, and the fully phased in common equity Tier 1 ratio was estimated at 11.3%. The liquidity position remained solid, with a low loan-to-deposit ratio of 82%, and full compliance with the liquidity coverage ratio rule.
