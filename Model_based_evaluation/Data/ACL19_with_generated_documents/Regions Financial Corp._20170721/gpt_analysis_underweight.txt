Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that the company has experienced stable loan balances, with a decline in consumer lending portfolio and an increase in mortgage balances. However, the company's decision to exit the third-party arrangement within the indirect vehicle portfolio has resulted in a decline in indirect vehicle balances. Additionally, average home equity balances have decreased, offset by improvements in the risk profile of the portfolio.

In terms of deposits, total average deposits decreased slightly, with the Corporate and Wealth Management segments experiencing declines. The composition of the deposit base is heavily weighted toward retail customers, with a focus on low-cost core deposits.

Net interest income and non-interest income have both experienced increases, with expectations for continued growth in the third quarter. However, total non-interest expenses have increased during the quarter, primarily driven by higher professional and legal expenses. The adjusted efficiency ratio is expected to be approximately 62% for the full year.

Asset quality has shown improvement, with a reduction in non-performing and criticized loans, as well as a decline in net charge-offs. The company's capital ratios remain robust, with a focus on prudently investing in businesses for future growth and returning an appropriate level of capital to shareholders.

Overall, the company has a strong outlook for the remainder of 2017, with expectations for modest loan growth, stable to slightly increasing net interest income, and a focus on expense management and optimizing capital ratios. The company remains committed to delivering strong shareholder value and maintaining a competitive advantage in a rising rate environment. As a financial analyst, based on the insights and financial metrics derived from the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance due to the company's current challenges in loan management, expense control, and a potentially slower pace of rate increases impacting net interest margin.
