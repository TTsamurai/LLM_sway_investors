Based on the recent earnings call transcript, there are several factors that lead to a cautious or skeptical perspective on Tractor Supply Company. 

1. Transportation costs: The company is experiencing headwinds from transportation costs both domestically and internationally, and these are expected to carry into 2018. This indicates potential challenges in managing operating expenses.

2. Pressure on gross margin: Despite efforts to drive sales and margin through pricing and strategic sourcing, the company anticipates a flat to slightly down gross margin in the fourth quarter due to product mix and transportation costs. This suggests potential challenges in maintaining profitability.

3. Increased payroll and wage pressures: The company is investing in additional payroll hours and wage increases to drive customer service levels, which may impact profit margins in both the third and fourth quarter and could continue into 2018.

4. Long-term operating margin decline: The company anticipates some level of operating margin decline in 2018 due to investments in long-term growth initiatives, leading to a slight decline in profitability.

5. Capital expenditures: The company is experiencing a reduction in capital spending due to timing shifts of key initial costs for the New York distribution center and a mix of store types. This may indicate potential delays in key investment projects.

In conclusion, based on the factors mentioned, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on Tractor Supply Company. The factors mentioned point to potential challenges in managing expenses, maintaining profitability, and executing key investment projects, which could impact the company's financial performance in the near future.
