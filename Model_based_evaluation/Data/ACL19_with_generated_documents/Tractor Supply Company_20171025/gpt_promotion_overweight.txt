Based on the recent earnings call, it is evident that the company has experienced significant growth in net sales, net income, and comparable store sales. The increase in net sales by 11.6% to $1.72 billion and net income of $91.9 million indicates a strong financial performance. The company's comparable store sales increased by 6.6%, reflecting positive performance across all geographic regions and major product categories. Additionally, the sales benefited from an extended summer selling season and the sale of emergency response products related to hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

The company's gross margin also increased by 20 basis points to 34.9%, driven by strong inventory management and strategic sourcing initiatives. However, there was some deleverage in SG&A, including depreciation and amortization, which increased by 80 basis points to 26.3% of sales compared to 25.5% of sales in the prior year's quarter. This was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and additional investments in key strategic areas.

In terms of the company's outlook for the full-year fiscal 2017, they expect full-year sales to range from $7.17 billion to $7.22 billion, with comparable store sales increasing between 1.7% and 2.2%. They also expect net income to range from $416 million to $421 million, with earnings per diluted share to be $3.25 to $3.29.

Looking ahead to 2018, the company anticipates some headwinds in terms of operating margin due to higher freight expense, wage inflation, and investments in long-term growth initiatives. Despite these challenges, the company remains focused on managing the financial impact to deliver earnings growth.

Overall, based on the company's recent financial performance and outlook, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The strong sales growth, improved gross margin, and strategic investments for long-term growth indicate the potential for continued financial success and shareholder value. With a positive outlook for the full-year fiscal 2017 and a clear strategy for addressing future challenges, the company presents an attractive investment opportunity.
