. It is clear that Tractor Supply Company has shown strong performance in the third quarter of 2017, with a significant increase in net sales and net income. Key financial metrics such as gross margin, SG&A, effective income tax rate, cash balance, outstanding debt, average inventory levels, and realignment of the company's fiscal year were outlined in the earnings conference call transcript.

The company is adopting an 'overweight' investment stance as it expects full-year sales to range from $7.17 billion to $7.22 billion, with comparable store sales increasing between 1.7% and 2.2%. Net income is expected to range from $416 million to $421 million, and earnings per diluted share to be $3.25 to $3.29.

On the gross margin side, the company aims to continue using price management tools to drive both sales and margin while remaining focused on its goal of growing market share. However, they also anticipate headwinds from both product mix and transportation costs in the fourth quarter and are targeting gross margin to be flat to slightly down in comparison to the prior year.

Regarding SG&A, there will be incremental investments in key strategic initiatives in the fourth quarter, leading to a deleverage of approximately 80 to 100 basis points. The company anticipates some moderate impact from higher-wage inflation at both the stores and distribution centers due to state regulations and competition.

Looking ahead to 2018, the company expects to finish the construction of its New York distribution center in Q3 2018 and begin servicing stores in late fourth quarter. This will result in additional costs impacting earnings per share by approximately $0.03 to $0.04, with most of the impact in the second half of the year.

Tractor Supply acknowledges the impact of higher-wage inflation and higher transportation costs, but remains committed to managing the financial impact to enable the business to deliver earnings growth. The company maintains its long-term growth targets and is focused on achieving its strategic initiatives for long-term growth.

In conclusion, the detailed summary report on Tractor Supply Company's recent earnings conference call transcript highlights the strong performance in the third quarter of 2017 and provides insights into the company's financial outlook and strategic initiatives for growth.

This summary report supports an 'overweight' investment stance, as it demonstrates the company's solid financial performance and its proactive approach to managing potential headwinds while remaining focused on long-term growth.
