Here's a summary of the financial metrics discussed in the recent earnings conference call transcripts for the Hematology and Oncology franchise:

1. REVLIMID:
- Net sales grew 16% year-over-year and slightly declined by 4% quarter-over-quarter due to significant Russian tenders in previous quarters.
- Excluding the impact of Russian tenders, REVLIMID Q4 net sales grew approximately 10% year-over-year outside the U.S., and year-over-year volume growth outside of U.S. was 14%.
- REVLIMID TRxs increased versus prior year and versus prior quarter, with successful launches in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in 20 countries.
- Expecting approval for maintenance and transplant eligible NDMM patients in the U.S. in the first quarter and in the EU in the first half of the year, with additional opportunities to expand the use of REVLIMID-based triplets.

2. POMALYST/IMNOVID:
- Delivered impressive growth in Q4, with 29% year-over-year and 11% sequential revenue growth.
- Maintaining leadership position in the third and fourth-line plus patient segment in major markets with accelerated growth and increased duration in triplet combinations.
- Awaiting FDA approval for POMALYST in combination with daratumumab for relapsed refractory myeloma by June of this year, with ongoing key development programs to support multiple combinations.

3. ABRAXANE:
- Continues to have quite stable demand, net sales grew 14% quarter-over-quarter and declined by 1% year-over-year.
- Maintains leadership position in pancreatic cancer and demand is stable in breast and lung cancer.
- Expecting results of the APACT adjuvant pancreatic cancer trial to be available by the end of 2017 and pivotal ABRAXANE/Tecentriq combination trials in non-small cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer to read out in 2018.

Overall, the company highlighted strong financial performance driven by underlying demand for REVLIMID and POMALYST/IMNOVID, with multiple key growth drivers for 2017 and significant opportunities in the myeloma market, lymphoma program, myeloid diseases, and solid tumors. Additionally, there are multiple Phase III data readouts expected by the end of the year and plans to initiate additional pivotal programs for later-stage pipeline assets in 2017.
