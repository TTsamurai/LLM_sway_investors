. In conclusion, the recent earnings conference call transcript for the Hematology and Oncology franchise shows strong financial performance and significant progress with development programs. Key financial metrics include robust sales performance driven by REVLIMID, POMALYST/IMNOVID, and ABRAXANE. REVLIMID net sales grew 16% year-over-year, with significant share and duration gains in newly diagnosed myeloma. POMALYST/IMNOVID achieved impressive growth, and approval for POMALYST in combination with daratumumab is expected by June. ABRAXANE demonstrated steady growth, with multiple growth drivers ahead, including upcoming trial results in adjuvant pancreatic cancer and pivotal combination trials in non-small cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer.

The mid to late-stage pipeline is advancing with multiple pivotal programs enrolling and additional programs expected to initiate by the end of 2017. Exciting progress is also being made in lymphoma, myeloid diseases, and solid tumors. The company has submitted a new drug application for enasidenib in relapsed refractory AML and is actively engaged in planning for additional indications. The collaboration with Acceleron for luspatercept is progressing well, with Phase III trials in lower-risk MDS patients and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia fully recruited in 2017. The company is also evaluating additional pivotal opportunities in myelofibrosis, MDS, and AML.

The upcoming year is expected to be important for lymphoma program, with multiple Phase III readouts and plans to initiate pivotal programs in relapsed refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and additional indications. Overall, the company is optimistic about the growth opportunities in multiple myeloma, with plans to address unmet needs in high-risk patients and elderly, frail patients. The company believes there are multiple options to develop a portfolio that includes CAR-T, bispecific antibodies, and new CELMoDs.

In terms of ABRAXANE, the company is confident in the positive results from the APACT study and expects a fast uptake if the study is positive. Additionally, the company believes ABRAXANE has an advantage in chemo combinations for non-small cell lung cancer and sees an economic advantage compared to other options. 

Overall, the company's strong financial performance, robust pipeline, and growth opportunities in multiple myeloma and lymphoma support an 'overweight' investment stance. The company's strategic initiatives and promising developments position it for continued success and growth in the near future.
