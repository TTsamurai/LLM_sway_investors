Based on the discussion in the earnings call, it appears that Hilton is performing well, with strong growth in multiple regions and positive forecasts for international development. However, it is important to note that there are potential risks in the market, such as the impact of political events on international travel. The company's emphasis on limited service development may limit its exposure to the full-service and luxury segments, potentially impacting long-term growth potential and overall market share. In addition, despite strong performance, the company may face challenges with international developments and potential changes in economic conditions in the U.S. Therefore, it is recommended to approach an investment in Hilton with caution and maintain an 'underweight' stance.
