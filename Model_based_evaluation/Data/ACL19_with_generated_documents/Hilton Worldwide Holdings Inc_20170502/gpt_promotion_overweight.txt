Based on the recent earnings call of Hilton, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company reported strong results in the first quarter, with RevPAR growth at the top end of their guidance range, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS above expectations, progress on their share repurchase program, and an increase in adjusted EBITDA guidance for the full year. The company also saw tremendous momentum in unit growth, with nearly 8,000 net rooms opened in the quarter and expectations for approximately 6.5% net unit growth for the year, along with over 100,000 new signed rooms in their development pipeline.

Additionally, Hilton reported favorable top line performance, with system-wide RevPAR increasing by 3% in the quarter, supported by industry-leading brands and a strong commercial platform. With solid group and transient performance, the company expects full-year system-wide RevPAR growth in the 1% to 3% range.

Hilton's pipeline increased by 16% year-over-year to a record 2,100 hotels and 325,000 rooms, signaling strong growth in the future. The company continues to focus on strategic and disciplined growth, with new units coming from existing brands and organically-developed new brands targeted at incremental market segments.

Hilton's effective franchise rate is currently at 4.8% system-wide, with plans to increase to 5.6%. The company has also had success with new brands, such as Tru by Hilton, and expects to have about 10 Tru hotels open by year end and an additional 75 next year.

In addition to new brands, Hilton's existing brands have significant upside, especially in international markets. The company opened its 100th hotel in China and continues to strategically expand its footprint in resort destinations and key international markets.

Overall, Hilton's business model is resilient and focused on growing market share, units, and free cash flow per share, while preserving a strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. Hilton plans to return $900 million to $1 billion to shareholders this year, with around $200 million in the form of quarterly dividends and the full balance in share repurchases.

As a stock promoter, I believe Hilton's recent performance and outlook suggest a strong opportunity for investment, supporting an 'overweight' stance on the company.
