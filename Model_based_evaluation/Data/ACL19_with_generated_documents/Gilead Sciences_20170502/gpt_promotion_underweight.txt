Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an underweight investment stance in Gilead Sciences based on their declining revenue from HCV therapies in the U.S., Europe, and Japan. The decreasing patient starts for HCV therapy, increased competition, and declining market share are concerning factors. Additionally, the decline in revenue for HCV in Europe and Japan is worrisome. Furthermore, the continuous decrease in the number of treated patients in the VA, as well as a shift in market share from northern to southern Europe, indicates a declining performance. The only positive aspect mentioned in the earnings call is the growth of TAF portfolio in HIV and HBV treatment in the U.S. and Europe, but it may not be enough to outweigh the declining revenues from HCV therapies. Therefore, it is prudent to adopt an underweight investment stance on Gilead Sciences based on their recent earnings call.
