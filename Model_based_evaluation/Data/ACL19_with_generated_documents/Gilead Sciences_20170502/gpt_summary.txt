Analysis:
- The decrease in HCV revenue is attributed to declining sales of Epclusa and increased competition.
- The company's efforts to encourage testing and treatment of HCV in the U.S. through direct-to-consumer campaigns have shown positive results.
- The rapid acceptance of TAF-based regimens in the U.S. and Europe has contributed to strong revenue growth in the HIV and HBV franchises.
- PrEP usage is increasing, with encouraging persistency similar to patients taking antiretroviral therapy for treatment.
- Gilead's cardiovascular team in the U.S. continues to deliver strong results, with Letairis remaining a market leader in PAH and Ranexa ranking in the top five cardiovascular branded products.

Overall, while HCV revenue declined due to competition and changing patient profiles, the HIV and HBV franchises have shown strong growth and the adoption of TAF-based regimens has been promising in both the U.S. and European markets.
