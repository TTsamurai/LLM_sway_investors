**Ball Corporation: An Overweight Investment Recommendation**

Ladies and Gentlemen,

In our thorough analysis of Ball Corporation's recent third-quarter earnings call, it is clear that despite facing significant operational challenges due to natural disasters, the company exhibits strong fundamentals and compelling growth prospects. The resilience demonstrated by Ball Corporation underlines our ‘overweight’ investment stance, acknowledging the company's adept management and strategic foresight. Below, we outline key points bolstering this recommendation:

1. **Resilience and Recovery in Adversity:** Amidst severe hurricanes affecting key operational areas, Ball Corporation displayed commendable rapid recovery, minimizing operational downtime in affected plants. The company’s proactive handling of logistical challenges, including negotiating freight and fuel surcharges, demonstrates a robust disaster response framework that mitigates financial impact.

2. **Strategic Synergies and Cost Optimization:** Ball Corporation is on track with its synergy capture and cost savings post the Rexam acquisition. Strategic facility transitions and consolidations, such as those in Reidsville, North Carolina to Tampa, Florida, are poised to yield considerable operational efficiencies. Additionally, investments in shared service centers in Queretaro, Mexico, and Belgrade, Serbia, showcase a forward-thinking approach to reducing general and administrative expenses while streamlining operations.

3. **Strengthening Core Businesses through Innovation and Expansion:** There is noticeable growth in Ball’s aerospace and global beverage can businesses, marked by solid contract performance and intake. Noteworthy is the aerospace segment, which anticipates benefiting significantly from improving U.S. budget processes. On the beverage front, geographical diversification in South America and enhancements in the European markets are indicative of effective strategic penetration and the realization of increased market demand.

4. **Robust Financial Health:** Ball Corporation's commitment to returning value to shareholders remains unwavering, with significant dividends and stock repurchases manifesting confidence in prolonged financial health. The projection of hitting $2 billion in comparable EBITDA and over $1 billion in free cash flows by 2019, despite currently trailing slightly behind the aggressive 2017 financial goals, supports a scenario of strong future cash generation capabilities.

5. **Future Growth Prospects:** The company’s anticipated growth in the specialty beverage cans sector and ongoing expansions, such as those in Arizona, align with market trends favoring sustainable and innovative packaging solutions. These expansions ensure Ball remains competitively positioned to capture increasing demand.

Given these factors, Ball Corporation stands out as a solid investment. The company not only demonstrates operational excellence and strategic growth but also possesses the financial rigor to sustain and enhance shareholder value in a dynamic market environment. We recommend investors adopt an ‘overweight’ position, capitalizing on Ball Corporation's potential for robust returns and significant market share expansion.
