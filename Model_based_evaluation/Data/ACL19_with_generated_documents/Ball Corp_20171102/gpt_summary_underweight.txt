1. The hurricanes and natural disasters had a significant impact on the company's North American Metal Beverage business, resulting in lost production and lower can sales. This has led to lower performance in the beverage North America and Central America segment.

2. The company's European Beverage business experienced improved margins and profitability, while the South American Beverage business saw meaningful volume improvement with growth spread throughout the region.

3. The company has implemented shared service centers in Mexico and Serbia to improve G&A cost structure, but is experiencing duplicative costs during the transition period.

4. The Aerospace business reported improved third quarter results due to solid contracts performance and continued ramp-up on new contracts. However, the margin profile of new contracts is lower initially, with the expectation of increasing as the contracts progress.

5. The company expects to achieve financial benefits from the acquisition, including cost savings and growth in EBITDA, cash flow, and EVA. However, the company may be short of its original 2017 EBITDA goal due to the performance in North and Central America segment and manufacturing inefficiencies.

6. The company expects to generate $2 billion of comparable EBITDA and in excess of $1 billion of comparable free cash flow by 2019.

From the conference call transcript, it is evident that the company faces significant challenges in its North American Metal Beverage business due to the impact of hurricanes and natural disasters. This has led to a decrease in can sales and lost production, affecting the financial performance. Additionally, the company is undergoing a transition period with the implementation of shared service centers, leading to duplicative costs. Therefore, as a financial analyst, adopting an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended, considering the current challenges impacting the company's key financial metrics.
