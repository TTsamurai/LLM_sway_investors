Based on the recent earnings call and the information provided, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on Ball Corporation. The company's performance in the third quarter of 2017 was impacted by natural disasters and other external factors, leading to challenges and frustrations. The hurricanes had a significant impact on the company's supply chain and resulted in a combined seven days of lost production. Additionally, there were significant spikes in freight rates and out-of-pattern freight, which negatively impacted the company's results. The impact of these challenges overshadowed an otherwise good performance across the rest of the company.

Furthermore, the company acknowledged that they will likely be short of their original 2017 EBITDA goal, and it was also mentioned that they expected higher steel prices going into the next year. The impact of these challenges, along with the complications of implementing cost-saving and growth initiatives, may hinder the company's financial performance in the near future.

Overall, while the company has outlined plans to capture cost savings and improve performance in the long term, the current challenges and complications may warrant a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company's investment potential. Therefore, taking an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended based on the recent earnings call.
