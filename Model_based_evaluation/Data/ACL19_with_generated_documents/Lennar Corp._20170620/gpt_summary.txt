Hi everyone, I'm here to present a detailed summary report on the recent earnings conference call transcripts. The focus will be on key financial metrics mentioned in the call. 

Firstly, there is a strong sense of optimism in the market and an overall positive business environment. The housing market is showing strength and improvement. Key financial metrics indicated a 15% increase in deliveries in the first quarter and continued growth in new orders in the second quarter. Additionally, the company is seeing improved margins and a higher sales pace in various markets, particularly in Portland, Seattle, Inland Empire, Coastal California, the Bay area, Tampa and Southeast Florida.

The company's core homebuilding operations are performing extremely well and have seen significant growth in their digital marketing efforts, generating over 100,000 internet leads per quarter. This has led to a reduction in marketing and advertising spends for 10 consecutive quarters.

The Financial Services segment has contributed operating earnings of almost $44 million, and the company is focusing on expanding its non-Lennar business reach to replace diminishing refi business earnings.

The Multifamily Apartment segment is also performing well and has generated $6.5 million of earnings in the second quarter. The company has a geographically diversified pipeline of 76 communities, totaling approximately 23,600 apartment homes.

Rialto's investment and asset management platform has contributed $6.2 million to the bottom line this quarter. The company's third opportunistic fund has had a final closing with approximately $1.9 billion in total commitments and has already invested or has under contract 33 transactions involving the investment of over $600 million of equity.

FivePoint successfully completed its IPO, entering the public market as a pure play California master plan community developer.

Overall, the company is focused on cash flow generation and improving its balance sheet. The completion of the WCI acquisition has been efficient and has enabled the company to leverage its construction cost preferred customer approach and SG&A leverage for better operating results.

The company is focused on reverting to a pure play homebuilder model over the next couple of years and has a strong presence in the land market.

In conclusion, the company is optimistic about the remainder of the year and expects a refined pure play homebuilder with improved operating margins in the future. The continuous focus on technology initiatives, digital marketing, dynamic pricing, and operational efficiency are expected to drive operating leverage and bottom-line growth. As always, the company looks forward to keeping its shareholders and investors updated on its progress.
