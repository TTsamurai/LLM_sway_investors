**Company: Hormel Foods Corporation**

**Date of Conference Call: Q1 Earnings Call**

**Financial Performance Summary:**

1. **Earnings Per Share (EPS):**
   - Reported a slight increase in EPS to $0.44, up 2% from the previous year.

2. **Sales and Volume:**
   - Sales declined by 1% with a volume decrease of 2%.
   - Adjusted sales grew by 3% and adjusted volume increased by 5%.

3. **Segment Performance:**
   - Refrigerated Foods, International, and Grocery Products segments reported earnings growth.
   - Specialty Products earnings remained flat.
   - Jennie-O Turkey Store (JOTS) encountered significant challenges, with earnings plummeting by 25% despite a 13% increase in sales and 22% in volume. This segment faced a reduction in profit margins from over 24% to 16% due to severe market conditions including lower turkey prices and heightened competition.

**Key Challenges:**

- **Jennie-O Turkey Store's Struggles:**
  - The division continues to be heavily impacted by declining turkey prices, which dropped more than 60% year-over-year, heightened operational costs primarily due to bio-security measures and inferior yields in plant operations, and increased market competition.
  - Management does not foresee immediate relief in commodity prices, suggesting continued pricing pressures in the marketplace.

- **General Operating Expenses:**
  - Increased due to investments in bio-security to prevent avian influenza outbreaks.

**Market and Operational Insights:**

- **Innovative Product Lines:**
  - Refrigerated Foods benefitted from innovative product lines tailored for both the retail and foodservice sectors.
  - Grocery Products experienced sales growth from Justin's specialty nut butters and other brands like Wholly Guacamole and Herdez.

- **International Operations:**
  - Notable growth in fresh pork exports, despite a temporary slowdown due to changes in import regulations, which have since been resolved.

- **Specialty Foods:**
  - Despite a significant sales and volume decline, the sector saw growth in CytoSport driven by food, drug, mass, and convenience channels.

**Future Outlook:**

- While management maintains a positive outlook for demand in JENNIE-O branded products, the adverse market conditions lead to an expectation for full-year sales to be flat compared to the previous year. In contrast, there's anticipated solid performance in other segments like Refrigerated Foods and Grocery Products forecasted to aid in overcoming challenges faced by Jennie-O Turkey Store.

- **Adjusted Full-Year Guidance:**
  - The company has revised its full-year EPS guidance to $1.65 to $1.71, reflecting the adverse impacts mainly stemming from the Jennie-O Turkey Store.

**Investment Stance - Underweight:**

Given the current market dynamics and substantial challenges faced notably in the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment which significantly impacts overall profitability, our investment stance remains 'underweight.' The anticipated persistent lower turkey prices and competitive pressures do not bode well for near-term recovery, despite growth in other sectors. Investors should exercise caution and monitor the companyâ€™s ability to navigate the adverse market conditions and implement effective cost-control and innovative strategies to bolster profitability.
