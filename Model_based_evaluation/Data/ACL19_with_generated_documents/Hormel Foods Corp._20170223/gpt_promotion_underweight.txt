Based on the company's recent earnings call, the company's Jennie-O Turkey Store segment had a very difficult quarter, with earnings down 25%. The company attributed this to declining turkey prices, increased expenses, and increased competition which created a difficult operating environment. They also mentioned that they do not see near-term relief on commodity prices which will pressure their pricing in the marketplace.

The company adjusted their full-year guidance to $1.65 to $1.71 per share, reflecting the challenges in the turkey industry. They also acknowledged that percentage declines in earnings for the second quarter will likely be similar to the first quarter, while decreases in the back half of the fiscal year are expected to be in the mid-single digits.

In contrast, the company's Refrigerated Foods had another strong quarter with operating profit increasing 4%, and they are expecting better results for the remaining three quarters of the year. Grocery Products also saw strong sales growth, and the addition of Justin's specialty nut butters contributed to sales and volume growth.

The company's International segment will perform as planned for the full year, and they anticipate strong sales for SPAM luncheon meat, SKIPPY peanut butter, and CytoSport protein products in the International segment for the year.

Overall, the company's balanced model is expected to overcome the challenges at Jennie-O Turkey Store. They expect strong performance from their other segments to offset the market headwinds at Jennie-O Turkey Store.

Based on this information, it would be prudent to recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company due to the challenges facing the Jennie-O Turkey Store segment and the cautious outlook for the company's full-year guidance.
