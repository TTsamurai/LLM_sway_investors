Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that the company has had a strong start in 2017, with record-breaking production and positive growth projections. However, there are several key financial metrics that indicate potential cause for concern, leading to an 'underweight' investment stance.

Firstly, the rising lifting costs are notable, with Q1 posting of $0.65 per Mcfe, just above the midpoint of the guidance of $0.60 to $0.70. The increase in workover activity in Q1 resulted in a higher lifting cost, and the company is beginning to feel cost pressures in items such as compression and water hauling. While the company remains vigilant in maintaining a reduced operating cost structure, it is important to closely monitor how these cost pressures may impact financial performance.

Furthermore, the drilling and completion costs are also increasing, with 5% to 10% rises in drilling costs and as much as 25% increases in the cost of tubulars. The company has seen its total well costs rise modestly, with the largest cost pressure being on the completion side. The current total company per well average frac cost has increased by approximately $300,000 to $500,000 per well compared to Q4 2016, with variables such as lateral length, number of stages, and pounds pumped impacting the cost. It is crucial to assess the potential impact of these cost increases on profitability and financial stability.

Lastly, there are potential concerns about the differential increase on the gas side. While the company is currently not experiencing problems with selling its gas, the long-term outlook for Mexico infrastructure and demand, as well as the surplus capacity on takeaway out of the basin, raise questions about the sustainability of current gas sales. Similarly, while the company has not experienced problems with getting oil or gas out of the basin, the variations in gravities and changes in the Midland â€“ Cushing differential could impact oil realization and hedging practices.

In conclusion, while the company has displayed strong production performance and growth projections, the increasing lifting costs, drilling and completion costs, and potential concerns about the gas and oil differentials should be carefully considered in adopting an 'underweight' investment stance. It is important to closely monitor these key financial metrics and their potential impact on the company's financial performance and stability.
