In conclusion, based on the earnings call report, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company's first quarter production exceeded expectations, setting a new record for total company production. The updated 2017 production outlook shows a 24% to 28% increase over the previous year, with a focus on high-liquid Permian and Mid-Continent projects. The company's strong tailwind from Q1 is expected to result in continued production growth throughout the year, with a forecasted year-over-year total company production growth of 13% to 17%. The company also anticipates a strong exit rate going into 2018 and plans to bring on 60 net Permian wells and 39 net Mid-Continent wells during 2017. Despite some modest increases in total well costs, the company remains optimistic about the current year and anticipates great momentum going into 2018. Overall, the company's performance and future projections support an 'overweight' investment stance.
