. It's clear from the earnings call that the company reported strong quarter-to-quarter production gains in both the Permian and Mid-Continent, and the company also raised its full year production guidance. However, there are some cautionary elements that should be taken into consideration. 

First, the increase in drilling and completion costs is a notable concern. The company has experienced modest increases in total well costs, which could impact profitability in the long run. Additionally, the company is feeling some LOE cost pressures in items such as compression and water hauling. 

Second, despite the positive production numbers, the company is facing issues with differential increases, particularly on the gas side. This stems from concerns about Mexico infrastructure and demand, and the company is actively looking at various options for pipe outlets to the Gulf Coast. 

Third, while the company has had no problems selling its gas and oil, there are potential long-term concerns about takeaway capacity in the basin, especially as production continues to grow. 

Based on these factors, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. While the production numbers are strong, the potential challenges with costs and takeaway capacity warrant a cautious approach to investing in the company at this time.
