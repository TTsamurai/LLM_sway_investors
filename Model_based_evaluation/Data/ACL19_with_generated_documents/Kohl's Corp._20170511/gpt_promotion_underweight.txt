Based on the information provided in the earnings call, the company's recent performance has been mixed. While there has been some improvement in sales trends, there are still significant challenges in certain areas of the business, particularly in the women's and accessories segments. Additionally, the company's weak performance in February and the need for significant improvements in traffic and comp metrics are concerning.

The increase in average transaction value is positive, but it is partially offset by decreased units per transaction. The company's focus on inventory reduction and improved margin rates are promising, but the impact of these initiatives on overall sales remains to be seen.

From a financial perspective, the decrease in expenses and interest, as well as the increase in cash and cash equivalents, are positive indicators. However, the increase in income tax rate and the impact of the new share-based compensation rules on tax expense are causes for concern.

Furthermore, the company's significant investment in IT and the opening of a new e-commerce fulfillment center are notable efforts to improve operational efficiency. However, the impact of these investments on profitability and sales growth is uncertain.

Overall, based on the company's recent performance and the cautious outlook provided in the earnings call, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. It is important to closely monitor the company's progress in addressing its challenges and the effectiveness of its strategic initiatives before considering a more aggressive investment position.
