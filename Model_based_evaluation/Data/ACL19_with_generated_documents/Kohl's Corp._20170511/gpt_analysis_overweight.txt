. From the earnings call transcript, there are several key insights and financial metrics that support an 'overweight' investment stance for the company:

3. Expense reduction: SG&A decreased by 3% to $975 million for the quarter, with expenses leveraged by two basis points on a 3% decrease in sales. The reduction in marketing and store expenses contributed to expense reduction.
