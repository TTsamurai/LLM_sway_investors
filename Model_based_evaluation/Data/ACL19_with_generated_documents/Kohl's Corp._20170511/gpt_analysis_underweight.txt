Based on the earnings call transcript, there are several key insights that support an underweight investment stance for the company. Here are a few financial metrics and insights that contribute to this assessment:

1. Decrease in comparable store sales: The company reported a 2.7% decrease in comp sales for the quarter, with the most challenging month being February. Although there was improvement in March and April, the overall trend is still negative.

2. Decrease in transactions and traffic: While there was improvement in transactions and traffic throughout the quarter, the company still reported a decline in these key metrics, which indicates challenges in attracting and retaining customers.

3. Performance of women's and accessories businesses: The company mentioned that the women's and accessories businesses continued to be challenging, which could signal weaknesses in key product categories.

4. Increased tax expense: The company's income tax rate increased by 160 basis points due to the adoption of new share-based compensation rules, resulting in a higher tax expense.

5. Increased capital expenditures: The company's capital expenditures were $40 million higher than last year, driven primarily by spending on a new e-commerce fulfillment center, which could impact profitability in the short term.

6. Decline in proprietary brands: The company reported a mid-single-digit decline in private proprietary brands, indicating potential challenges in product offerings and customer preferences.

Based on these insights and financial metrics, it is reasonable to adopt an underweight investment stance for the company, as there are indications of declining sales, challenges in key product categories, and increased expenses impacting profitability. Investors may want to consider reducing their exposure to the company's stock based on these factors.
