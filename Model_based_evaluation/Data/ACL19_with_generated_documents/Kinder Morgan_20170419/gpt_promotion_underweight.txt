 and the finalization of our financial arrangements for Trans Mountain. No, the goal was to get to a fully negotiated JV and to a fully marketed IPO. We are not there yet, but certainly, nothing about our results would change our expectation that we will get to those fully-negotiated and fully-marketed conclusions. That's a tough one. As Tom said, 3% of the turned-back capacity was picked up in a matter of days, so it was a very temporary window, and it's difficult to read anything into that other than it was an overhang from the increased tolls, and that was relieved quickly. That's still our best error out there. That was four years ago, and it's easy to forget all that has changed in the market. And I think as Rich said, the real — the secret here is we reconfirmed the value and the need for the project. If you look at what the shippers did and consider that at the higher cost, the demand for the project remained strong, that's a huge development in this environment. And as Rich said, we have 6.7 times EBITDA multiple in our backlog. That's our expectation. This is consistent with that, and, so, we think that, that's a big win. So, absent — the other predictions would be if there are any specific questions on the call about how we are preserving value in downturns, you know how we model our economics and preserve value in downturns. But it's clear from this that we did, and so any questions about that we'd be happy to take. Not significantly. Agua Dulce — getting to Agua Dulce didn't use to be a very big deal, you were just in South Texas. If you're in Agua Dulce and connected to our system, and you can go to Mexico or you can go to Corpus Christi or you can go to Houston, then you have really got something. Now, we need to — we are working to sell for the upstream piece, and that's where DCP, I think, is a very nice fit. But there are others out there too, who we could coordinate with to make sure that we can get the gas to WAHA. And of course, EPNG expansion fits very nicely with that. We are in discussions with our customers right now, and we did not expect that the — anything other than — at most, a de minimis impact on the margin for those assets. disco — we had the discount to do that, but we expect to be slightly ahead of our plan on this business, and we currently have all of our vessels under charter. We continue to make good progress in our baseline terminal expansion at our Edmonton hub, and as I mentioned, we put our Kinder Morgan export terminal project in service on the Houston Ship Channel — ship channel. So those are the main takeaways. Thank you. I'll briefly touch on our financial condition and our commitment to our balance sheet, and the primary drivers of our financial health remain unchanged. First, we project to get to a 5.4X debt-to-EBITDA — debt-to-EBITDA ratio from our sizable project backlog. Second, we've reached a very preliminary agreement on the Trans Mountain project and — and of course the Elba and other projects are proceeding well. And by well, I mean they are progressing through long construction and well into operation. A monitored growth capital plan. A new 1.7 BCF a day pipeline in the Permian and along our Texas intrastate network. It's very clearly a commercial project and has significant potential return implications for us, and we'll look to maximize — maximize the present value return hosted by that system. And then lastly, we've reduced the — the fraction of our — of our adjusted EBITDA from our Rubicon project in the fourth quarter. The environmental assessment, or EA, and the BC's extensive five conditions. So this signifies significant momentum afforded to BC shippers. I just wanted to give you a few product market highlights. In the gas segment, experienced slightly increased transmission volumes year-over-year, but gathering volumes were — were down in that same time period. We had the strong quarter in the products segment. Refined products volumes are up 1% year-over-year, even though we experienced some weakness in the Southeast U.S. I'll start with gathering. We are generally seeing leveling off of volumes in our key basins during the first quarter, but the comparison to first quarter last year — first quarter 2016 reflects the declines that took place throughout 2016. Generally, our volumes, are in line with what is observed in the basins in which we operate, although we are running a little bit ahead in our Bakken's gas assets, with one exception, and that's the Haynesville, where we are down on our KinderHawk asset. Thank you, Mike. It's — really it's a tough one, but 3% of the turned-back capacity was picked up in a matter of days, and so — so it was a very temporary window, and it's difficult to read anything into that other than it was an overhang from the increased tolls, and that was relieved quickly.

We continue to make good progress in our baseline terminal expansion at our Edmonton hub, and as I mentioned, we put our Kinder Morgan export terminal project in service on the Houston Ship Channel — ship channel. So those are the main takeaways. Could — could I move on to the other part of the question? We are running both of these processes simultaneously, and again, the point there is that we want to get — that’s right, we want to get ourselves to a fully negotiated JV and to a fully marketed IPO. Whatever the market says at the time about what things — what type of deal is priced in the market. We happen to think that we — we really like our project. We think it's a high-quality project and it should — it should command a high quality — a high-quality return. So we're confident that either process, if we — if we choose to go, should get us a strong result at the end of the day. I had one quick comment on the JV component of the comment. I looked at — the quick update, as far as getting to a JV process, was an invitation to negotiate, and we have set a 90-day target for those negotiations. We are right at that target, and we expect that there will be some positive reports to follow from that process. So it looks like the JV process is on schedule. So I wanted to touch — just revisit on a — what are we — the major discussions for the remaining projects in the backlog. I think we are looking at the performance for the quarter and the — a really across-the-board success on the Elba Terminal in the products segment and along with that was success migrating our Jones Act vessels portfolio to — from underperforming to now fully deployed and 95% utilized, to quote approximately 80% of segment earnings and before is now coming from liquids activity. The project update at Elba was — that was both in service and at the value that we put in for 2017, that doesn't even consider the value that we create in originating and developing the project. And then in the products pipeline operation, terminal expansion. And I will close with that the situation at the gas segment, we did not have any transportation and facility development for the quarter. The outstanding physical performance and the quarter, was pretty much proof that we have — we've been able to move past the volume decline that has been impacting or gas assets for the past few quarters. We will now get — a quick response to our — we believe that the producers there are increasingly turning their attention to find additional routes out of the Permian. Sometimes that takes a bit of time to ripen. But there's certainly interest in it, and we think that we can also cultivate interest from the demand side as well. We expect development, and — most likely more to come on that. And we are posting much of that on the back of the rig count being up a good bit, and acreage changing hands from people who were not actively developing to people who are actively developing, and that’s real positive indications for the Permian. It seems to me that by any measure of success, we've done it in the gas business, I think we've talked about higher transportation volumes. I tend to get excited when they are higher. From last year, the winter was weak, it was weak last year too, but we had a cold March in 2016. Power demand was down year-over-year. What I have read predicts that gas will still exceed coal's share of the power market again this year, but some gas-to-coal switching did occur on our assets in the first quarter. Also we saw higher renewable, including California hydropower contributing to the year-over-year decline. Overcoming this though, were exports to Mexico. Thank you for your question. That's — yeah, that's still — I mean, I'm sorry, you'll — you won't find a — a much stronger position for upstream and downstream connectivity than we have. Obviously — and so I'm interested in the — the response to the potential partners, but the reason that we are — very interested in getting this up — this pipeline, this new-build pipeline is that they have the best connectivity on the supply end in the Permian, as well as the best connectivity to LNG, Mexico, and utility and industrial markets along the Texas Gulf Coast, for that matter. Shippers I think are — are increasingly turning their attention to find additional routes out of the Permian. Sometimes that takes a bit of time to ripen. So we want to make sure that the — the Permian is — is flowing efficiently, and our pipe can do that. But certainly there is interest in it, and we expect development, and most likely more to come on that. Economic development. There is benefits to the First Nations and the communities along the route that we

Summary:
The company has had a very good first quarter, exceeding beginning of the year guidance for DCF per share. Progress has been made on the Trans Mountain project, despite the increased cost estimate. In the gas segment, increased transmission volumes and gathering volumes are in line with basin operations. There have been promising developments in the Permian, with increased rig counts and acreage changing hands indicating a positive outlook for gas production. The company's financial outlook remains unchanged and the focus is on securing financing terms for the Trans Mountain project. Despite the positive performance for the quarter, it is recommended to take a cautious or skeptical stance on investing in the company based on its recent earnings call.
