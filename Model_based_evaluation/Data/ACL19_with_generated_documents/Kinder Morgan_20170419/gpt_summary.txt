, right now we are forecasting our DCF per share at $0.54, which is better than our beginning of the year guidance. Despite the higher cost estimate of the Trans Mountain project, we are still forecasting to be on plan for the full year. Additionally, 708,000 barrels have remained under long term contract, further demonstrating the strong demand for the project. We have also made progress on reaching an agreement with a partner for a joint venture or including the project in an IPO. We expect to update you on the resolution of this by the end of the quarter, taking into account the assumption of a JV partner picking up 50% of the capital. Moreover, we completed our Elba JV transaction in line with the value in the plan for 2017. 

In terms of other projects, on our Utopia pipeline project, we have made excellent progress with right of way acquisition and routing alternatives. We have also seen positive developments on our EPNG system, with a binding open season for capacity to WAHA and the potential participation of DCP in our Gulf Coast express project. 

Furthermore, our gas segment has experienced a leveling off of volumes in key basins, with some improvements expected in the Haynesville. Our transmission volumes are up 1% year-over-year, primarily driven by increased exports to Mexico and LNG. 

In the products segment, we have seen a 1% increase in refined products volumes. However, we have also experienced some declines in crude and condensate transportation volumes in certain basins. Our terminals business has achieved a utilization rate of over 95%, with the majority of segment earnings before DD&A now coming from the liquids part of the business. 

Overall, we remain committed to advancing our key projects and continuing to deliver strong financial performance. We are also closely monitoring developments related to the Trans Mountain project and the potential impact of market conditions on our long-term value. We expect to update our guidance in the latter part of this year, taking into account the ongoing processes for a potential JV or IPO.
