, and that's all a little bit too early to call as well. My own commitment on that, our own commitment on that, is it is a mid-single digit increase on -- for both of those things that we promised, and on the promote, it's meant to be a lot more than that. And the other components that will be valued here are the return earned on the equity invested by the project company, on the dividends received by us and then on the equity component of the JV where we have the share of net income. And so those are three very material components of our long-term value here, and we will be looking for something in the high teens on that. Those are certainly factors that are -- or levers that are available to us here. We are not working towards a JV a specific -- a single specific JV partner, but we are working to a fully marketed process, and there's a broad range of potential partners out there. I think in the industry, in the financial industry as well, and plus those who are interested in the long-term value of the project as well. So no, this is not a situation where we expect to have a single partner here, but rather a well-marketed process. No, no cash calls. It's a cash call of non-equity financing, project-level financing, so at that time, as we talked about earlier, it will also be put in the positions to fund that with either borrowing -- well primarily borrowing, but also potentially issuing some transnational bonds. I think it's probably low probability at this stage. Yeah. And the final FID and the payment -- the promote -- so the promote that we would expect. But other than that, we have not broken out the capital by year, and that's just under 50-50. The debt is expected to be just shy of $4 billion, and the equity, just shy of $4 billion. And recall we are not counting the promote in that. I mean, your suggestion is reasonable. Thank you. Well I think -- one of the big things is getting the commercial in place, and that kind of gives a green light to the project itself, and I think the main run up on the financial side, is getting the financial -- getting the financial arrangements in place. I will also mention the work, the stakeholder engagement that we continue to have, is very substantial. As you know, we have had a lot of success in preserving the intake so far -- yeah, and system specifications as well. The support capacity is all sold at very good... we did that in just a week or week and a half. The financial arrangements there is probably the main driver on the financial side. And a close second is the contractual agreements with the BC. Thank you, Brandon. We hope that's the case. Well, I think the structural pieces will be sorted out when we have a marketed joint venture. At the very least, we will be managing the project and we expect to have the return, the project equity. So those will be the alignment pieces, but -- so I think when you are talking about cash needs, we expected that at some point. But in intermission I was talking a minute ago, we have some levers to pull other than the equity contribution. We have some things we could -- different places we could put the equity contribution, and that may come into being. But before -- at the earliest it would be in conjunction with FID, and significantly more likely if it occurs at all at FID. So those are levers that are out there for us. I am sorry we stopped before such a meaningful chance of the topic, but I am sure we will surface some time in the future. So we are fairly close here, and defining the final commercial, after the final commercial arrangements are in place, we will move towards FID. I will say it's a major project, that has a lot of interest from a lot of parties that are intending to come, but it's also a project that is -- it's a risky project, so I think we will be looking to share the investment risk and show some reduction. Particularly on the equity side. I think R/C is a portion of the costs, and it's a portion that's proportional to the size of a very big project. So we are talking about north of $3 billion and that's a significant amount of capital -- probably $4 billion. And it is all significant for us, cash-wise and balance sheet wise, but it's a girl [ph] so we are going to handle it. Yeah, I think those, the project finance so we need project finance to pull it out. The portions that are -- the proportions that we are talking about, I think the only way to do that is debt. I am not sure, maybe you are asking this Michael, I'm not sure what pieces, exactly are cross held, but I am confident Trans Mountain is moving towards a cross Pacific deal in the marketplace, and signing off on it over the summer. It's kind of late to sign off on projects in Canada in the winter, albeit it's a cold winter, but by the time you know what they really are and we are certainly on that schedule. Well, there are many other moving parts Alan, with respect to the financial arrangements, and so we get the final arrangements in place. These options, these transactions are not the critical path on going to the market. And so I think those are all well in hand, those are all -- those are all certain, the debt will primarily come at the end, and that's a small portion of the total project. So I think the majority of our spend this year will be on our pipeline and terminal projects.  Our words in the tank industry, that we are going to be slowing down as we got into a new year and then our spend in the second quarter always tends to be up. So, we think our plan for the year holds. And kind of going back to Alan's original point, I think we are going to be okay on a basis. Yeah I had a combination of opportunities to pick up from the market without a capex car mounted into that, so we have seen a way to [indiscernible] [11:51:00]. And then I will say something about this, to finish your point. Yeah, it's right to talk about the uncertainty of them [ph]. We had a lot of interest in this capacity, and I expect that those opportunities will resurface, and so I am optimistic about seeing good news on some of the projects. And that blunts the uncertainty about -- oh well, Brent has always been on the downward, right?. It changed over time. That's likely to be the case, I will say that. I get letters from the regulator to say -- okay, it's at this cap, look for adjustments. And the reality is, that envelope is going to be more than anything else. It's a different kind of national scheme, but I don't know. I don't know if it's going to be a big hit, or a big miss, but I think it's going to be a big hit. I mean, it's a Canadian project, it's in Canada, and a big part of it is Canadian regulation. I think we will have to take into account the risks that we know about. Most projects have significant construction risk, and after the project. The interesting thing is, we are not going to touch, we are not really connected to the south by that project. So there won't be any underwriting requirement on this. I don't think it's a watch list... I think lately, we are looking at stepping back from this project, we probably shouldn't. We didn't vote for it, and I am thinking about it. And over the project, you won't have to step in to cover other projects. I think we are going to contribute some of our capital to the early stages of it, because it allows us to cover a certain amount of our risk. But I can't imagine the hypothetical scenario of us stepping in and helping them. We don't have the best terms, and we are going to give us a good handle on those transactions. But that becomes one SPF [ph] of the... one of the steps here. You can take that right out, because labor right now is the majority -- probably the majority -- by the end of the year. That's just north of $20 billion in Canada. We have $20-odd billion in the backlog now in Canada. We are going to close one of those. The JV, in the away, is going to close out actually, with the provincial and DNR final permitting. And we get the mineral rights to complete the transaction there. Also on robustness, that's our guiding principle. So -- we're going to continue to develop the best transactions to help our confidence. What did you say was going to happen? I am not sure what you mean by that. So those are the considerations as we build the plan, and again, that's a big company right now, and so those are the core plans that are still in place for U.S.A. Those are major costs for us right now. Those are single, non-sequential, and few growth. Did I miss anything? I don't think so. I can add one quick thing there. We should just make clear, $1.2 billion is the total figure for the project, partnership fees. Thank you, that's a lot of short term and long term agreement. That's a little under $900 million, and the other part of that, was the actual value, from the lead firm. I just missed a quarter of what you said, I'm sorry Jean Ann. It certainly does, but again, as you're used to it, you heard it said, we 're watching it very closely. We, and our fleet are doing this very well. But we are the minority player out of the non-hike efforts. Very close to a decision, so the development results are what we needed to still be very accurate. In terms of working with Asia, that's going to be appealed to us and if we're using it for storage, we're not worried that Russia is [indiscernible] [11:57:00]. But in the capacity for storage, is that a tight thing you use? We have the last-minute [indiscernible] resolution, and I feel like we have the right time to act. But as long as we evolve, we're diverse and disseminate our [indiscernible] and whether it's excellent with insufficient gas, we'll go to Exxon, we'll get pipeline there, and so on. With us we're not acknowledging any obsolescence, we're more optimistic. And the difference has been to 80% short stopgap. We're aware of that and we're going to see higher demand as the transpired oils and gasseustainability structure matures. I don't think the not being announced has a lot of shock potential. You might see downward revisions to the gas models. That gets addressed in my question when Charlie mentioned raising more equity funds to service the pre-move, dance back in the game. We are behind this, and so, in the interest of marketable deliveries, we'll be buying gear to make business improvements, and we're going to have to enable us to serve shifts that are going to go on the grid. Michael, it's just going to be utilizing those parameters. We don't have exposure to the Appalachia. Those bigg iterative [ph] areas, we don't have exposure to, and they're largely stable. But that being said, we've seen a small difference in what we were resigned to see, so that could be worthwhile. We're not overly committed to expanding into the lab at this time. And then what you would be donning, we're not getting burdens... I'm happy to address Jim. Most of that was right except for uncertain development of integrating robust integration of Russian resources into the European scheme. Rich, follow up? It was just gratitude as an entirely positive with the gas situation, and that's why I'm so excited about pipe projects and projects that are creating supply. So we're happy with the way it's working out. I think on the gas side it depends a lot on getting back into the habit of going back to the farm and redeveloping, and now a lot of people are thinking about that, so I think our future is still good. I think Jim will justify this, and we're still very confident about how it will work out, and we expect a strong commercial featuring... A thing I will add Tim is that we've done our structure in such a way that China and Russia can soften the bites. So it's been smoothed out and we expect to reach 70% of the target and I think it will all work out fine. We expect the return on the economic investment in our back print to be great. Basically, we've got no margin here. And as always, the survey is a little bit domestic and a little bit regular, but none of it is substantive enough to change our outlook. So my view on that is that the yield rounding up to most of it and you know, it's feast swells. So we're seen as uncertain as it's come in. So that's all good, in terms of the European agreements. Overall, this venture is on the plus, Jim. But Michael, if you think of all the risks that are staring potential beings, a lot of those have dissipated and we're watching closely. But we aren't abruptly changing our outlook Michael. Well I feel, Michael that we are on first track with this, and in fact more optimistic about dirty deals because we don't even worry about the bad slowing down. Thank you, Rich. I think we -- imagine we have a diet of chips here and as usual the chips program, with the more GOP we fund there, I think... I think if a mystifying world of good talent is as winner as you get, we're really missing out. I can envision the processing being pushed back and our best answer is because this will connect Jim, our Texas and... I think on the Russian side with the smaller, the trend I think is for the bad to get bad in Cleveland, and frankly, that's the sort of genetic trend we're picking up each piece of wood before it's sashayed up to the point where I think the probability goes at making new sign-ups, and as long as people start doing that, they just keep planting to the genetic trend of coming, and that's very happy. Thank you, Jim. That's just one arrow of a move. I think when the Permian and Eagle Ford was down, we thought it was because of the geographic differential because the truth is, we were down back then. We felt it too. So, what's comforting now is saying... As far as risky projects go, if people are relocating it's a reflection, and in IPv I think it's bad reflection, and one of them is one that we've seen over and said less environmental hadances are here, and saying, oh, that's the most robust prediction I've ever bought. So, the thing is worse is a reflection of the maybe-future expectation that they might just get lost. Jim, we are not, and there's actually angle to it because that's because... it's open to our market now. So, thank you for asking and that is still vibrating with the progression we've been showing here. I think we're not your eye guys at Cornelius, and I'm hoping for it in the quarter. I don't say more great projects will be idle, but it's a reflection of mirroring those bigger projects, and the strength of what the compensation gets us. It's sort of been a business of never been the issue here. So while in the summer with the lab [indiscernible] I think we could be a bit brighter, being a little bit more experienced now, and doing the development, all those different margin calibration for potential cost and it's rod we've got to work with, and how we could take more down in return. But after really negotiating to come out, there's still a chance for a sustainable wind to resist at Windy. So, we're feeling very comfortable, and bearing this out and over the end cost. Michael, I want to assure you, that we're not at the turntable, and we're not sticking our heads in the sand. We are avoiding loading the upfront in exchange checks on a smaller scale. But when examined in the entirely good seat, confirming our terms for the upstream inputs is not by any means favoring them.
  
In conclusion, the earnings conference call focused on the performance and progress of key projects, including the Trans Mountain project, Elba JV transaction, Utopia pipeline project, gas segment, products segment, and CO2 business. The call highlighted the progress in achieving environmental approval and regulatory agreements for the Trans Mountain project, as well as the joint venture and IPO developments. The discussion also addressed the financial arrangements and investment considerations for the projects, including the value of the projects and the potential for profitable returns. Despite the strong first-quarter performance, the financial outlook and key financial metrics remained cautiously optimistic, with a focus on maintaining a strong negotiation position and managing the financial risks associated with the projects.
