### Investment Report: Strong Buy Recommendation for Lockheed Martin

Dear Investors,

We are pleased to present a compelling case advocating for an 'overweight' investment position in Lockheed Martin, based on the highlights and projections from their recent earnings call that underscore robust financial health, well-supported operational strength, and promising growth prospects.

#### Exceptional Financial Performance:

Lockheed Martin's financial results for the second quarter were compelling, evidencing strong operational and financial results that have enabled the company to increase its full-year 2017 guidance for sales, operating profit, and earnings per share (EPS). The impressive financial performance, illustrated by quarterly cash flows exceeding the previous year by nearly $200 million, underscores a robust financial backbone that supports sustained growth and value return to shareholders.

#### Strategic Contracts Fueling Growth:

Lockheed has secured several high-valued and strategic contracts that promise substantial revenue in the years to come. Noteworthy among these are:
- A $3.8 billion contract for 257 Black Hawk helicopters, with an option expanding the potential value to over $5 billion.
- A substantial $5.6 billion funding for 74 U.S. jets under the F-35 program, which further indicates a 65% increase in lot size compared to the prior order.

These contracts not only boost the company's order book but also reaffirm the continued trust and reliance placed in Lockheed Martin by the U.S. government and international clients.

#### Strategic Position Amid Rising Defense Spending:

With enacted defense budgets showing substantial increases and bipartisan recognition of rising global security threats, Lockheed is well-positioned to benefit. The FY17 Department of Defense (DoD) budget landed approximately $524 billion, with the president's FY18 request marking nearly a 10% increase from the prior year. These enhancements in defense budgets directly correlate to increased funding and opportunities for Lockheed Martin programs.

#### Innovation and Market Expansion:

Lockheed Martin continues to epitomize innovation in defense and aerospace. Notable achievements include the successful unveiling of the F-35 variants in international assembly facilities and the historic display at the Paris Air Show. Moreover, the initiation of significant agreements, like the $28 billion intent by Saudi Arabia to procure Lockheed products, expands their market footprint and solidifies future growth pathways.

#### Forward-Looking Statements:

The company’s outlook for 2017 and beyond has been adjusted upward, reflecting confidence in continued growth in sales, EPS, and cash from operations. Management’s strategic focus on expanding international sales, which currently accounts for over 27% of total sales and is expected to grow, aligns with the geopolitical demand for advanced defense capabilities. This global market expansion, coupled with strong managerial emphasis on innovation and sustainability of operations, presents a favorable long-term growth trajectory.

### Conclusion:

Given Lockheed Martin’s robust financial performance, strategic contract acquisitions, advantageous positioning within an expanding defense budget framework, and ongoing innovative breakthroughs, we strongly recommend investors to adopt an 'overweight' stance on Lockheed Martin stock. The breadth of the company’s market influence, combined with its strategic initiatives, positions it uniquely for substantial growth and profitability, which we anticipate will yield significant returns on investment.

As always, we look forward to your feedback on this investment opportunity and are here to discuss any further details you may require.
