### Investment Analysis Report: Cigna Corporation (Underweight Recommendation)

#### Executive Summary
Cigna Corporation, a global health service company, has shown strong financial performance in the first quarter of 2017 with consolidated revenue rising by 5% to over $10 billion and a 20% earnings growth. Despite these strong results and positive trends in several segments, concerns about sustainability in their growth strategies, market risks, and regulatory pressures suggest a cautious approach. This analysis recommends an 'underweight' stance on Cigna's stocks based on the evaluated potential risks and opportunities.

#### Financial Performance Highlights
1. **Revenue & Earnings Growth**: Cigna reported a significant increase in revenues and adjusted income from operations. The adjusted income from operations for Q1 2017 was $719 million, or $2.77 per share.
2. **Segment Performance**: 
   - **Global Health Care**: Reported a 12% earnings growth mainly due to strong customer growth across all Commercial market segments and managed medical costs.
   - **Global Supplemental Benefits and Group Disability & Life**: Both segments showed double-digit revenue and earnings growth, attributed to stable results and improvements in performance metrics.

#### Leadership and Strategic Initiatives
- **Leadership Changes**: With the retirement of longtime CFO Tom McCarthy and the appointment of Eric Palmer, Cigna is undergoing a critical transition in its financial leadership. The new CFO’s ability to maintain or accelerate current financial strategies remains to be seen.
- **Innovative Partnerships**: Cigna has formed multiple value-based arrangements with hospital systems and pharmaceutical companies focusing on outcomes-based reimbursement models, which have been recognized with industry awards.

#### Risks and Concerns
1. **Leadership Transition**: Changes in key leadership positions such as the CFO could lead to shifts in financial strategy or execution, introducing uncertainty.
2. **Regulatory and Market Risks**: The ongoing uncertainty with the Anthem merger and regulatory changes, especially in the health insurance sector, pose significant risks. The potential for changes in healthcare legislation could impact profitability and market strategy.
3. **Sustainability of Growth**: While Cigna has shown strong growth in early 2017, the sustainability of such growth under dynamic market conditions and evolving healthcare laws is uncertain.

#### Strategic Outlook
- Cigna expects to leverage its strong capital position for further growth initiatives and has forecasted deployable capital at over $5 billion for 2017.
- The company’s under-levered balance sheet indicates potential for increased capital deployment ranging between $7 billion and $14 billion, which necessitates cautious monitoring due to potential impacts on financial stability.

#### Conclusion & Investment Stance
Based on the outlined financial and strategic analysis, the recommendation is to adopt an 'underweight' stance on Cigna's stock. The potential leadership volatility, coupled with significant exposure to regulatory and market risks, could impact the company's ability to sustain its current growth trajectory. Investors should monitor upcoming regulatory decisions, leadership effectiveness under the new CFO, and the company’s ability to manage its ambitious capital deployment strategies. This stance will be re-evaluated based on mid-year financial results and more clarity on the regulatory and market fronts.
