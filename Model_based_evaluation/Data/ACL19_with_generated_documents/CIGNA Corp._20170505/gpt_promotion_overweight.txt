Additionally, Cigna has entered into value-based arrangements with physician-based group and hospital systems, further strengthening its partnerships with healthcare professionals. The company's innovative efforts in the pharmaceutical space and its focus on community engagement demonstrate a commitment to creating sustainable value for customers and shareholders.
