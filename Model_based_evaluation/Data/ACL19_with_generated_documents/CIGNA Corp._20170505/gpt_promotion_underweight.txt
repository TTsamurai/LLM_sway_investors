.As a stock promoter, based on the transcript from Cigna's recent earnings call, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company.

The company reported strong financial results for the first quarter of 2017, with consolidated revenue increasing by 5% to more than $10 billion and 20% earnings growth. However, there are several key areas of concern that should be noted. 

First, the leadership changes within the organization, including the retirement of Tom McCarthy and the appointment of Eric Palmer as the new CFO, may introduce a level of uncertainty in the company's future performance.

Additionally, the ongoing legal battle with Anthem regarding the proposed combination is a risk factor that could potentially impact the company's future plans and performance.

Furthermore, while the company emphasized its strong momentum and increased outlook for 2017, the discussion on their Individual market strategy indicated a measured approach and awareness of the dynamic environment, which could imply potential challenges in this segment.

There were also discussions on the company's increasing medical cost trend and the impact of legislation on the small employer market, signaling potential challenges in managing costs and market dynamics.

In conclusion, while Cigna has reported strong financial results and has outlined strategic initiatives to create value for shareholders, there are factors such as leadership changes, legal battles, and market challenges that warrant a cautious perspective. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended based on the company's recent earnings call.
