Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript for ITW's first quarter 2017, the following key financial metrics of the company can be summarized:

1. GAAP EPS: ITW's GAAP EPS increased by 19% to $1.54, or 21% excluding the effects of currency translation. 
2. Total Revenue: Total revenue for the first quarter was $3.5 billion, representing a 6% increase. Organic growth was positive in all major geographies, with North America up 1.4% and International up 6.4%.
3. Operating Margin: ITW achieved an all-time record for operating margin in the quarter, driven by continued progress on enterprise strategy initiatives and volume leverage. The company's operating margin improved by 120 basis points over last year.
4. Operating Income: Operating income grew by 12% to $809 million, the highest quarterly total in the company's history.
5. Effective Tax Rate: The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28.3%, which was in line with expectations as the company adopted new FASB guidance for stock-based compensation.
6. Free Cash Flow: Free cash flow for the first quarter was $399 million, representing 74% of net income. Adjusted for certain items, the free cash flow conversion would have been 91%.

Given the financial information provided in the conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for ITW. The company's strong performance in terms of revenue, operating margin, and operating income is commendable, but the improvement in operating margin was largely driven by enterprise strategy initiatives and volume leverage, and not sustainable in the long term. Additionally, the impact of price/cost on margin percentage needs to be considered. The company's strong balance sheet and free cash flow may indicate potential for capital allocation strategies such as buybacks, but disciplined M&A approach remains a focus for ITW. The company is slightly cautious about the price/cost and margin guidance, which may imply a potential risk in the near future. Therefore, based on the financial metrics and the company's cautious stance on future guidance, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended.
