Based on the recent earnings call, the company had a strong quarter with 8% organic growth, driven by growth across regions and industries, including transportation, consumer, heavy industries, and semiconductor. Acquisitions also contributed to sales growth and were accretive to earnings. The company's Connected Enterprise strategy is working well, with tangible results in multiple industries. The company also announced a partnership with ManpowerGroup to upskill military veterans, investing in the future workforce and creating a pool of certified talent for advanced manufacturing roles across the United States.

Looking ahead, the company expects continued growth in transportation and consumer, with low single-digit growth in heavy industry. They are not counting on growth from oil and gas and mining for the full fiscal year 2017. The company is increasing its adjusted EPS guidance range and expects 13% adjusted EPS growth for the year.

The company's performance in the automotive industry has been strong, with over 20% growth, driven by electric vehicle (EV) production and expansion into new geographies. The company's automotive programs have good visibility for continued spend.

In terms of the information and Connected Enterprise pilots, the company is seeing customer expansion and growth in existing operations. The company's A&S products are gaining market share, and the Chemical market has seen growth with the introduction of new products and services.

The company's mining and oil and gas segments are showing signs of improvement, but it's not yet a general inflection point. Latin America remains a source of strong growth for the company, particularly in Mexico.

The company is actively hiring and focusing on areas that bring additional growth while balancing the workforce. Investments in technology innovation, domain expertise, and market access remain a priority for the company's acquisitions.

Based on the overall positive outlook and strong performance in various industries, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company.
