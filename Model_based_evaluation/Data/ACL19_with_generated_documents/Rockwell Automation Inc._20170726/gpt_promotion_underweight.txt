Based on the recent earnings call, it is evident that the company has shown strong organic growth and performance across different regions and industries. The company's overall outlook for the rest of fiscal 2017 also appears positive, with expectations of continued growth and increased adjusted EPS guidance. 

The company's Connected Enterprise strategy is also showing promising results with tangible benefits across multiple industries, and the partnerships and acquisitions made by the company are contributing to technology innovation and domain expertise, thus adding to earnings.

However, it is important to note that the company's growth is still subject to variability due to the timing of projects and the macroeconomic environment, with some areas experiencing growth while others are still facing challenges. The future growth trajectory of the company also remains uncertain as it continues to face competition in the market.

Overall, while there are positive aspects of the company's recent performance, the cautious or sceptical perspective would recommend an 'underweight' investment stance, considering the potential variability and uncertainty in the company's future growth. It is important for investors to carefully assess the company's outlook and competitive landscape before making investment decisions.
