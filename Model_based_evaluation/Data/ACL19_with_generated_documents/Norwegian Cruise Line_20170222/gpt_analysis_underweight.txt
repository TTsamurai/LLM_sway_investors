 are also significant factors impacting our outlook for 2017. Based on the information provided in the earnings call transcript, it is clear that the company has faced challenges in the previous year, including geopolitical headwinds and technical issues with certain ships. Additionally, the company is expecting an increase in fuel prices and foreign exchange impact in the upcoming year. The company has also mentioned that the addition of new vessels may have a dilutive effect on yields. 

Furthermore, the company's outlook for 2017 includes an increase in capacity, with significant deployment in the Caribbean and European regions, as well as the introduction of new ships to the Chinese market. The company has provided guidance for adjusted EPS to be in the range of $3.75 to $3.85, with expectations of adjusted net yield to increase approximately 1.75% for the year, and adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel to increase approximately 1% on a constant currency basis.

Given this information, it is advisable to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. The challenges faced by the company in the previous year, coupled with the expected increase in fuel prices and potential dilution of yields from the addition of new vessels, may impact the company's financial performance in the coming year. It is important to closely monitor how the company addresses these challenges and executes its strategies before considering an investment. Moreover, it is crucial to keep an eye on how the company manages its leverage and capital return plans in order to gauge its financial stability and growth prospects.
