 are also contributing factors to the reset. 

Based on the company's recent earnings call, it is clear that they have reported another record quarter of revenue and earnings. The fourth quarter results were slightly ahead of expectations with adjusted earnings per share of $0.56, above the midpoint of their guidance range. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share grew 18% to $3.41, above the midpoint of their guidance range. They have also reported an increase in adjusted net yield and a decrease in adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Looking forward to 2017, the company's capacity is expected to increase, with strong deployment in the Caribbean, Europe, and the Asia, Africa, and Pacific region. Their guidance for 2017 indicates an increase in adjusted EPS and adjusted net yield, with an expected increase in adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel as well.

Given these positive financial results and outlook, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on this company. Their strong revenue and earnings growth, as well as their strategic deployment plans, indicate future growth potential. Additionally, their plans to de-lever and return capital to shareholders through share repurchases show a commitment to shareholder value. Overall, the company's recent performance and future prospects make it an attractive investment opportunity.
