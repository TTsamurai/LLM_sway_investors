Our recent earnings call emphasized the record breaking revenue and earnings achieved in the fourth quarter and full-year of 2016. While adjusted earnings per share and net yield met or slightly exceeded expectations, there are concerning factors that lead to a cautious outlook for the company. The increase in expenses related to repairs and maintenance, as well as the impact of geopolitical headwinds, have led to higher costs and decreased net yield for 2016. Additionally, the company's capacity is expected to increase by approximately 6.5% in 2017, with a significant increase in deployment to the Asia, Africa, and Pacific region, which may pose operational challenges and increased costs. Furthermore, the company's guidance for 2017 indicates a decrease in net yield and an increase in net cruise costs excluding fuel, leading to a cautious stance on investment. The company's strong reliance on hedging for fuel costs and potential geopolitical risks could also present uncertainties for future earnings. With these factors in mind, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company.
