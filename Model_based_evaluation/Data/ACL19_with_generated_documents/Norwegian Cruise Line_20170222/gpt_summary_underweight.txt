 have also contributed to the reset. Thank you, Frank. In summary, while the company reported another record quarter of revenue and earnings, with adjusted earnings per share of $0.56, and full-year adjusted earnings per share grew 18% to $3.41, it is important to note that adjusted net yield for the year was up 1.8%, or 1.2% on an as reported basis, while adjusted net cruise costs excluding fuel increased 1.7%, or 1.5% on an as reported basis. The annual capacity increase of approximately 6.5% in 2017, with increases in various regions around the world, also presents some challenges, particularly with the expectation of fuel price per metric ton net of hedges to be $450. Considering the dilutive effect of adding new vessels to the fleet and the timing of dry-docks, we adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for this company, as there are concerns about the impact on financial metrics such as net yield and net cruise costs. Additionally, the company's guidance for adjusted EPS for 2017 in the range of $3.75 to $3.85 represents potential headwinds from fuel and FX, which may affect the double-digit EPS growth. Therefore, we believe it is prudent to take a cautious approach to investments in this company at this time.
