Based on the recent earnings call, DISH has completed a transaction with EchoStar that gives them more direct control over the product development of their Pay-TV business, including Sling TV, and is projected to be modestly accretive to free cash flow due to efficiency initiatives. The transaction has also resulted in an increase in equipment revenue and net income.

Additionally, DISH has entered into an agreement with Hughes to market and install the Hughes broadband service, which will result in certain payments to DISH for each sale and installation. However, subscribers acquired under this agreement will not be included in DISH's broadband subscriber count.

The company also mentioned a pivot away from the wholesale model for their Pay-TV customers, which is expected to impact the SAC (subscriber acquisition cost) and reduce absolute dollars running through the P&L associated with the dishNET ads.

Overall, based on the recent developments and strategic initiatives outlined in the earnings call, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on DISH. The company's focus on gaining more control over its Pay-TV business and the potential for ARPU and margin expansion on the Sling side as it gains scale are positive indicators for future growth and profitability.
