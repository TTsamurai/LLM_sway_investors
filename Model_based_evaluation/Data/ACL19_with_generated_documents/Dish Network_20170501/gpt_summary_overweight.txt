Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript and the completion of the transaction with EchoStar, we are adopting an 'overweight' investment stance for DISH. The transaction has provided DISH with more direct control over the product development of their Pay-TV business, including Sling TV and is projected to be modestly accretive to free cash flow. The recasting of the numbers for the first quarter of 2016 has increased equipment revenue and net income, which indicates positive financial impact.

The balance sheet adjustments due to the transaction have been recorded at net book value and the tracking stock was removed with the difference booked as capital. Additionally, the agreement with Hughes for marketing and installing their broadband service will result in certain payments to DISH for each sale and installation, adding to the company's revenue. 

Regarding the company's Pay-TV customers, their shift away from the wholesale model is expected to have a positive impact on margins and customer retention. The company's focus on higher quality customers for their DBS and the expected ARPU and margin expansion for Sling TV as it gains scale are also positive indicators.

Although there may be some uncertainty due to confidential litigation settlements, the stability of the SAC on a per subscriber basis and the focus on higher quality customers and cost and revenue initiatives for DBS are favorable factors.

Overall, based on the provided information, there are several positive financial metrics and strategic initiatives that indicate a potentially attractive investment opportunity in DISH. It is recommended to closely monitor the company's progress and financial performance as they continue to execute on their strategic initiatives.
