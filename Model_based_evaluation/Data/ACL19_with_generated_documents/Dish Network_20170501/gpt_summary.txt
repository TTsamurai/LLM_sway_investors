Based on the recent earnings conference call, key financial metrics for DISH include the completion of a transaction with EchoStar, which transferred assets and operations of EchoStar technologies and broadcasting businesses to DISH. This transaction is expected to give DISH more direct control over the product development of its Pay-TV business, including Sling TV, and is projected to be modestly accretive to free cash flow. The impact of recasting the first quarter of 2016 increased equipment revenue by $40 million and net income by $10.6 million.

Additional agreements were made with Hughes for marketing and installing broadband services, but these subscribers will not be included in DISH's broadband subscriber count. DISH also stated a pivot away from the wholesale model for its Pay-TV customers due to its economic impact.

On the analyst Q&A, there was discussion about general and administrative expenses (G&A), average revenue per user (ARPU), subscriber acquisition costs (SAC), and the strategy for acquiring and retaining customers. DISH emphasized a focus on higher-quality customers, disciplinary credit, cost and revenue initiatives, and the potential for ARPU and margin expansion for Sling TV as it gains scale.

Overall, the recent earnings conference call highlighted the completion of a significant transaction, the impact on key financial metrics, and the company's strategic focus on improving financial performance and customer acquisition and retention.
