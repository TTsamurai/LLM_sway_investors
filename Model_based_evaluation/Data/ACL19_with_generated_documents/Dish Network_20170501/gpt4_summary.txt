### Summary Report on DISH Recent Earnings Conference Call

#### Key Transaction Overview:
DISH completed a significant transaction with EchoStar, where DISH acquired assets and operations from EchoStar such as EchoStar technologies and broadcasting businesses. These entities are involved in the development and distribution of set-top boxes, satellite uplinking services, and streaming video technologies. Additionally, DISH received investments in high-frequency spectrum bonuses, certain real estate, and the remaining 10% interest in Sling TV, all of which will support better control over product development in DISH's Pay-TV business. In return, DISH provided EchoStar with a tracking stock representing an 80% economic interest in the Hughes residential retail satellite broadband business.

#### Financial Impact and Metrics:
1. **Revenue Enhancement:** The transaction is expected to be modestly accretive to DISH's free cash flow, mainly due to the elimination of EchoStar's profit margin and other efficiency improvements. After the recast of Q1 2016 financials post-transaction, equipment revenue increased by $40 million, primarily due to international set-top box sales to third parties.

2. **Net Income Rising:** Post-transaction, net income for Q1 2016 increased by $10.6 million. This growth is attributed to higher margins from international equipment sales and the elimination of costs related to products and services previously purchased from EchoStar.

3. **Balance Sheet and Inventory Adjustments:** The transferred assets were recorded at their net book value and the tracking stock removal was adjusted in capital. The profit and loss account (P&L) and physical plant and equipment (PP&E) and inventory were adjusted to reflect the new operational structure without the set-top box and accessories margins paid to EchoStar.

4. **Agreement with Hughes:** DISH entered a deal with Hughes to market and install Hughes broadband services, which entails payments to DISH for each sale and installation. Note that subscribers obtained under this deal are accounted as Hughes-branded retail subscribers and do not contribute to DISH's broadband subscriber count.

#### Strategic Shifts:
- **Broadband Services:** DISH acknowledges a decline in its broadband subscriber count due to the structure of the agreement with Hughes and overall shifts away from the wholesale broadband model, which offered lower margins and higher customer acquisition costs.

- **Pay-TV Adjustments:** 
  - ARPU Dynamics: An increasing shift towards Sling TV, which generally has lower ARPU than DISH’s direct-broadcast satellite (DBS) service, affects the weighted average Pay-TV ARPU. Additionally, "cord-shaving" trends are influencing DBS subscribers to opt for smaller, cheaper packages.
  - Flex Pack Strategy: This new "skinny bundle" option contributes to ARPU pressures but is utilized as a churn-reduction strategy, potentially reducing the need for loyalty credits and hence enhancing margins.

#### Costs and Revenue Initiatives:
- **Subscriber Acquisition Cost (SAC):** SAC has remained stable both for DBS and Sling TV. Strategies to improve the quality of customer acquisitions and retention are in effect, focusing on more stringent credit evaluations and targeted cost and revenue initiatives.
- **Monetization Opportunities:** Untapped potential in addressable advertising revenues from Sling TV remains a significant opportunity for revenue enhancement as the platform scales up.

#### Conclusion:
The transaction with EchoStar, strategic shifts in broadband and Pay-TV offerings, and refinements in revenue and cost management initiatives position DISH to potentially improve its financial performance and market competitiveness, despite shifts in consumer behavior and the complex dynamics of the Pay-TV and broadband markets.
