### Summary Report: DISH Earnings Conference Call

#### Transaction with EchoStar
- **Overview:** DISH completed a significant transaction with EchoStar, acquiring key assets and operations from the EchoStar technologies and EchoStar broadcasting businesses. These include set-top box design and distribution, satellite uplinking services, and streaming video technologies—enhancements primed to bolster DISH's Pay-TV and streaming services, including Sling TV.
- **Financial Impact:** This transaction is expected to be modestly accretive to DISH's free cash flow, mainly due to the elimination of EchoStar's profit margin and the initiation of other efficiency measures. The transaction necessitated a recasting of past financials, which under common control accounting rules, increased Q1 2016 equipment revenue by $40 million (largely from international set-top box sales) and net income by $10.6 million.

#### Financial Performance Highlights
- **Equipment Sales and Net Income:** Post-transaction, Q1 2016 saw increased revenue and net income from international equipment sales and the removal of EchoStar's margin on previously purchased products and services.
- **Balance Sheet Adjustments:** Assets from EchoStar were recorded at net book value. Set-top box and accessories margins previously paid to EchoStar were adjusted on both the PP&E and inventory lines.
- **Hughes Agreement Impact:** DISH's agreement with Hughes for marketing and installation of broadband services will likely decrease DISH's broadband subscriber count due to the attribution of new subscribers to Hughes under the new arrangement, reflecting a strategic shift from a wholesale to a retail-focused model.

#### Strategic Initiatives and Outlook
- **Pay-TV and Sling TV:** The incorporation of assets from EchoStar is expected to enhance product development capabilities within DISH’s Pay-TV service, particularly for Sling TV. With increasing Sling TV subscriptions, the strategy includes the potential for ARPU and margin expansion as the service scales and monetizes opportunities like addressable advertising.
- **Subscriber Acquisition Cost (SAC):** SAC remains stable across both DBS and Sling services. However, DISH notes a strategic shift in focusing subscriber acquisition on high-quality, creditworthy customers and expanding cost-effective packages like Flex Pack to reduce churn.
- **Wholesale Model Transition:** DISH is transitioning away from the less profitable wholesale broadband model to a more controlled retail marketing strategy with Hughes, which while decreasing dishNET contributions to the P&L due to lower subscriber numbers, aligns with long-term profitability goals.

#### Investor Recommendations
- **Investment Stance: Overweight**
- **Rationale:** DISH's strategic acquisitions and alignments, particularly with EchoStar, provide stronger control over its technology and product pipelines, which are expected to drive revenue and margin growth, especially in the Pay-TV and streaming segments. The recasting of financials shows robust gains in key revenue and income metrics, underscoring the financial benefits of the transaction. Operational efficiencies combined with strategic subscriber acquisition set DISH on a promising path for long-term growth.
- **Key Risks:** The shift away from the wholesale model and ongoing adjustments in subscriber packages could affect short-term profitability. Additionally, ongoing competition in the streaming and satellite services market demands continuous innovation and marketing efficacy to maintain and grow DISH’s subscriber base and revenue streams.

This summary should assist in the development of investment strategies and financial models concerning DISH Network Corporation’s ongoing operations and market strategies.
