Based on the recent earnings call by Broadridge, I am recommending an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. Here are some compelling reasons to consider investing:

1. Strong Financial Performance: Broadridge reported impressive third quarter results with double-digit growth in revenues, adjusted EPS, and closed sales. Total revenues rose 46% to $1.01 billion, and adjusted EPS rose 19% to $0.69 per share.

2. Reaffirmed Guidance: The company reaffirmed its fiscal year 2017 guidance, expecting total revenue growth to be in the range of 40% to 42% and recurring fee revenues to grow by 29% to 31%. Adjusted EPS growth is expected to be in the middle of their 12% to 17% range, or 13% to 15%.

3. Strong Closed Sales and Pipeline: Broadridge reported record closed sales, and their pipeline remained strong. They expect to finish the year in the upper half of their closed sales guidance of $140 million to $180 million.

4. Efficient Capital Utilization: The company maintains a balanced approach to capital utilization, investing in its business while taking advantage of the increase in seasonal cash flow to step up repurchase activity. Broadridge has also increased its forecast for segment profit margins for GTO to approximately 21%.

5. Focus on Expense Management: Broadridge remains focused on disciplined expense management, with plans to increase spending on efficiency initiatives in the fourth quarter to position the business for more growth.

Overall, Broadridge's strong financial performance, reaffirmed guidance, and focus on efficient capital utilization and expense management make it an attractive investment opportunity. With a balanced approach to business growth and capital returns to shareholders, the company is well-positioned for continued success.
