**Broadridge Future Outlook Report**  
**Investment Stance: Overweight**

**Executive Summary**  
Broadridge has exhibited robust financial performance through the third quarter of fiscal 2017, with notable progress across revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share (EPS), and strategic acquisitions. The company’s effective management and strategic initiatives are poised to sustain and improve performance in the near term. Despite expecting higher expenses related to efficiency initiatives, Broadridge’s investments in its business infrastructure and strategic acquisitions like Message Automation indicate strong future growth potential. Given these dynamics, we recommend an overweight stance on Broadridge stock.

**Financial Performance Review**  
- **Revenue Growth:** Broadridge has reported a 46% increase in total revenues reaching $1.01 billion in Q3, mainly due to the acquisition of NACC. The company has maintained a steady pace in organic growth and expects to continue this trend.
- **Adjusted EPS:** The adjusted EPS saw a 19% increase, reaching $0.69, showing efficient operational handling and profitability growth.
- **Acquisitions:** The acquisition of Message Automation is strategically placed to enhance Broadridge's compliance capabilities in the GTO business segment, potentially increasing future revenue avenues.

**Strategic Insights**  
- **Investment in Efficiency Initiatives:** Broadridge plans to incur higher fourth-quarter expenses due to efficiency initiatives. This investment is targeted to streamline operations and enhance productivity, positioning the company for sustainable long-term earnings growth.
- **Strong Sales Pipeline:** The company's record sales closing and a strong sales pipeline are likely to result in revenue growth, especially highlighted by an emphasis on larger deals that generally have longer conversion times but assure future revenue continuity.
- **Capital Allocation:** Prudent investments in new business avenues coupled with systematic share repurchases ($69 average price) and dividend payment strategies highlight Broadridge’s robust capital allocation policy, thereby enhancing shareholder value.

**Future Outlook**  
**Revenue:** Projected to finish fiscal year 2017 at the higher end of the 40%-42% growth guidance, driven by an increase in event-driven revenues.
**EPS:** Expected to be within the middle range of the initial 12%-17% guidance, adjusting at 13%-15% growth. The rigorous approach to keeping expenses in check while investing in efficiency will likely bolster the EPS in FY 2018 and 2019.
**Capital Expenditures:** High capital expenditures are anticipated to continue as part of the efficiency and growth initiatives, with full-year free cash flow expected to be in the lower half of the $350 million to $400 million range.

**Recommendation**  
Our overweight stance is underscored by Broadridge’s solid financial performance, strategic acquisitions that align with its long-term growth strategies, and its proactive approach to capital management. Investors should consider the potential for appreciable capital gains due to the company's strategic positioning and robust operational performance. We anticipate Broadridge to surpass its sector performance and yield significant returns, driven by its strategic initiatives and strong market position.
