 growth. But I think the fact that two of the three pillars are satisfied with the performance that is even more important. Finally, I think we see lower cost and better operation results as a result of it as well. Iâ€™ll defer to Bruce on the SG&A, he has that information.

Based on the earnings conference call transcript, the key financial metrics can be summarized as follows:

1. Sales: The company experienced a positive comp increase in the third quarter, with an improvement in sales trends, particularly in kids, footwear, and Activewear. The positive comp performance was broad-based, with nearly all categories improving their sales trends. Sales for the quarter were up 1% for regular price items, while clearance sales were down 7%. The company's targeted efforts to capture share from competitive store closures in some trade areas are expected to continue and accelerate through the holiday seasons.

2. Financial Performance: The company's gross margin decreased due to higher shipping costs and reserves required for late sales in October. However, merchandize margin improved, and overall gross margin performance was consistent with expectations. The company's inventory per store was down, resulting in improved productivity metrics and lower cost of shipping and fulfillment. The company remains on track to achieve expense savings of $250 million over the next three years.

3. Digital and Omnichannel Initiatives: Online-generated demand sales grew 15% for the quarter, with stores fulfilling 30% of the total units for the quarter. The company opened its 5th Distribution Fulfillment Center (DFC), which is expected to contribute significantly to business growth and efficiency. The company continues to make progress in delivering a seamless and easy omnichannel experience, with improved mobile applications and increased digital conversion rates.

4. Loyalty Program Evolution: The company plans to simplify and broaden its loyalty program, including the Kohl's Charge, Yes2You Rewards, and Kohl's Cash. The objective is to enhance personalization and provide more rewards to users, potentially driving a step change in traffic and sales. A pilot of the loyalty program evolution is set for the second quarter of next year, with an expected company-wide rollout in fiscal 2019.

Based on this summary of key financial metrics, our recommendation is to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. While the company has shown improvement in sales and digital initiatives, there are challenges such as the impact of competitive store closures, margin pressures, and the need for further evolution of the loyalty program. The company's financial performance may not be strong enough to justify a significant investment at this time. Therefore, it is prudent to adopt a cautious approach and remain underweight on the investment in this company.
