 and those indicators are all pretty good as to how we’re doing on our localization efforts.

Overall, I think the company has made significant progress in various areas and has shown improvements in sales trends, digital business, and marketing efforts. The focus on the omnichannel experience, the active business, and the national brand penetration highlights the company's commitment to staying competitive in the market.

However, despite these positive results, there are still areas of concern. The weak September sales period, impacted by hurricanes and unseasonably warm weather, raises questions about the company's ability to handle external factors that can affect sales. The continued lag in the accessories category and the challenges in the women’s business suggest that there are still issues to address in certain product categories.

Additionally, the evolving loyalty program, while promising, poses a risk as it involves integrating different components and reaching a broader audience. The company needs to ensure that this evolution is successful and does not negatively impact customer engagement.

Furthermore, the impact of shipping and fulfillment costs on gross margin, while expected, is a consistent challenge for the company. The heavy reliance on shipping and fulfillment in the fourth quarter may continue to impact profitability.

In conclusion, while the company has shown improvement in various aspects of its business, there are still risks and challenges that need to be carefully managed. Based on the recent earnings call and the cautious approach to these concerns, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company.
