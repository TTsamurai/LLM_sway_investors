, and I think we believe that it will continue to have an impact on sales as we go into the fourth quarter. So I would -- those are probably the primary indicators of how successful those efforts have been to date. Well, our women's business certainly isn't back to positive yet, but the trend has consistently improved. So I think we’re far more optimistic about the trend of the business and the trend of our private brands that are contributing to that trend. Maybe you can come back to us on that in the fourth quarter, Gary, and we might have a little bit more to say about it then. The way to think about it is, we’ve been down low to mid teens now 7 consecutive quarters of lower inventory. And what this is really, a result of is just getting more responsible in terms of how we’re getting merchandize. We’re getting more relevant merchandize, closer to need. So, will we to want to see continued inventories decline for sure every quarter next year. And extended multi-years in this same kind of level and direction as we move forward. Well for us, of course, we’ll weigh in on this later, inevitably you have the Christmas season that sways those kinds of growth rates, so everybody will have a lot closer look at our growth rates a quarter or two from now. But for sure mid-teens feels right to me in terms of a growth rate. And then in terms of increasing levels of inventory turn, that’s our plan. So you take increased inventory turn with a high single-digit growth rate in inventory that’s the sweet spot for us. So I think from a margin perspective we feel super confident that we can continue the margin improvement that we’ve been seeing. And from a sales perspective we feel super confident that we are incredibly well positioned going into this fourth quarter. So I think if -- I think when you hear our guidance, which is raising the low end of the guidance, it just demonstrates our confidence in our ability to continue to deliver for investors and customers. So it feels like -- feels like, everywhere we look it is positive for us. And everything from our forays in Richmond and small shops feels like we’re making improvements. I mean, that are fit. Let’s put it this way, our footprint could and likely should contract. But as it contracts, the productivity of that footprint increases. You see example of that in the small shop strategy which we think is a very positive and productive example of that. And in these, kind of, test that we have going on such as our test with Amazon which we’ll exactly give you more color on that in the February call, but, is actually designed to help deliver higher productivity. So to your question “Is the breadth of these changes and newness and the continued evolution of the store portfolio we’re on what I would reflect in the term of footprint changes and productivity increases”, that would be the way I characterize that. In terms of thresholds for these kind of test to be considered successful, I think it’s going to be a little bit early to know for sure before all the holiday season is entirely over. And by early I mean before our February call. We have - we’re looking at a number of performance indicators and the cost of the offering, particularly so so we’ll definitely have more information in our February call. And in terms of the timing of these rollouts, as we complete pilots or tests, we are investing again and get to a position we’ll have to educate, we’ll have to demonstrate whatever the test or the pilot was. So it’s just going to be a little bit of time before you move this kind of test to scale. I think that’s all I have on question four. In terms of the store I mean the physical store role and the relevancy of our stores. I mean, it is so important for us. And as we have iterated a couple of times, this is really the reason for our existence. For me really it comes down to the ultimate competition we have which is delivering the best omnichannel experience to the customer. And for us, particularly since we are largely non-mall based, 95% of our stores are located in freestanding or strip locations and so that gives us a big advantage in the omnichannel space. And therefore, as we continue to make investments to make those units more productive, we continue to realize more insights into how we can operate the rest of our store fleet even better. The expansion of our smaller shops and testing that we have increased in the store is going to overall give us a significantly greater view of how we can operate stores more effectively as we move forward. So I guess I would say this and we have made such strong progress in this area and from our standpoint this is not just important but critically important. And as we move forward, these tests and the effort we’re making continue to prove out to be very advantageous for us, And it’s why we continue to invest and we’re hyper focused on making sure that we’re continuing on this journey. And then any details on any performance components of any test, we’ll have in the February call. And any of the specifics around what this initiative or this test means to improving our business, as it’s already been inserted, it's seven consecutive quarters of reducing inventory. And our merchandize margin is up, I think, 116, 17, 18 in each of the last quarters. It's probably pretty difficult to have any more confirmation than that that the tactics and strategies we’re employing around making our stores more productive is working. I mean, I believe it’s safe to say that every single measure we have today of competition, we have improved and that would, of course, not take into account, further initiatives as we move forward. So when we talk about our cost savings initiatives, that’s an area that we specifically target. So, we believe, and I think you can see from our results, that these are delivering and there’s still room for us to continue to make large operations changes and be successful. I think, Bruce that covers that. And then, Chuck, on the second part of your question about any risk of these initiatives, I mean, I think success in local positioning is a relatively well known retail. I think this is certainly one of our initiatives where we feel like it’s being targeted and delivering what our intention was. I think, so -- the ceiling on expansion said the ROI position is likely to continue to perform and deliver positive results. And so, I would say the risk is relatively low. Once we’re finished is budgeting, the repositioning and localization is going to continue to have a major positive effect and a significant, significant positive effect in particular as we continue to move forward. I mean, hey, I mean, what I would say is, I feel more optimistic about our personalized pricing and product initiatives. It's backed up by not a lot, but at least 90 days of testing good momentum into fourth quarter. And our sense is every one of these initiatives we put in place can continue to attract and drive that traffic. I think that you could tell on clearances we’re having a lot more products than we did a year ago which I think is a positive trend. So that retail methodology you’re probably seeing that. And certainly just a recap of the results. I mean we have a significantly improved sales trend. We’re entering the most important quarter for our business going into the holiday period and online demand is at the highest penetration of the year. So the guidance that we’ve already given, we feel relative confident of achieving that goal with both the lien and balanced inventories and a strong trend in home. And that digital business really growing double-digits going into the quarter. You can clearly hear as we talk through this and the color we’ve suggested that every way -- every trend we’ve got indicates a positive for us moving into the fourth quarter.								 							  							  							  							    From a competitive perspective, obviously the competitive environment for retail is very dynamic and continues to evolve. Our focus is to continue to execute on driving traffic and ensuring operational excellence, while at the same time continuing to make strategic investments in our omnichannel initiatives and store optimization. Our main focus is to leverage the success of our active business, national brands penetration, private brand performance, omnichannel experience and loyalty program evolution to drive growth and profitability. All in all, we remain optimistic about the company's future, but believe that the current stock price may not fully reflect potential future headwinds and challenges. Therefore, we suggest adopting an 'underweight' investment stance for this company. Thank you.
