, which is a positive.

In terms of financial metrics, some key points to highlight are:

1. Sales performance: The company saw a positive comp increase in the third quarter, with steady improvement in sales results throughout the year. Sales performance was driven by strong back-to-school selling season and sequential improvement in store traffic metrics.

2. Gross margin: Despite a decrease in gross margin due to higher shipping costs and reserves required for late sales in October, merchandise margin improved for the quarter. The company expects continued improvement in merchandise margin and lower cost of shipping and fulfillment.

3. Inventory management: Inventory per store was down low single-digits at the end of the third quarter and expected to be down mid single-digits at the end of the year. The company aims for future multi-year contraction in average inventory per store, which will have positive implications for working capital and cash flow metrics.

4. E-commerce growth: Online generated demand sales grew 15% for the quarter, with stores fulfilling 30% of total units. The company continues to focus on improving the omnichannel experience and leveraging mobile applications to drive digital conversion.

5. Loyalty program evolution: The company plans to pilot a new evolution of its loyalty program to simplify and broaden its reach in the second quarter of next year. This pilot is expected to drive a step change in traffic and sales, with learnings to be included in a companywide rollout in fiscal 2019.

Overall, the company continues to make progress in delivering the best-in-class omnichannel experience and is confident in its ability to achieve financial goals and drive traffic and sales. The positive trends in sales, gross margin, inventory management, e-commerce growth, and loyalty program evolution indicate a strong financial outlook for the company.
