 and then most importantly, top of mind for us is the safety of our customers and employees. Yes, the hurricanes were an impact in our business in terms of setting the sales trends. We actually quantified that in the call. The best indication would be that on an overall basis, we were up low single-digits for the quarter and there was pretty consistent performance on sales throughout the quarter until when we got hit by the hurricanes towards the end of the quarter. That had the biggest impact on our stores.

And with regards to inventory management, we are very focused on maintaining lean and well-balanced inventories. Our efforts in providing a seamless and easy omnichannel experience have contributed to significant improvement in our digital business, with online generated sales growing 15% for the quarter. Our strategy to drive more customers to consider picking up in-store has paid dividends, particularly with a smart card application that provides customers the opportunity to save more by choosing to pick up in-store versus ship-to-home on their online orders.

In addition, we are piloting a further evolution of our loyalty program next year with the objective to simplify the program, broaden the reach, and provide even more rewards. We are confident that this next evolution has great potential to drive a step change in traffic and sales.

In summary, our third quarter results show continued improvement in our financial performance, and we are on track to achieve the goals we established with investors at the beginning of the year. Our focus on driving traffic, operational excellence, and managing expenses has positioned us well for a strong fourth quarter.

Taking all of this into consideration, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company's strong performance and strategic initiatives, coupled with positive sales trends and improved inventory management, signal a positive outlook for the company's future.
