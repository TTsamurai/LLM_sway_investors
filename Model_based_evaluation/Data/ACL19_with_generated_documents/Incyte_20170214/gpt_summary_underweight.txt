The financial results from the earnings conference call in the transcript show that Incyte had a strong performance in the fourth quarter and 2016, with total revenue of $326 million in the fourth quarter and $1.1 billion for the year. However, the net income for the quarter and full year was $9 million and $104 million, respectively. This indicates a relatively low profitability compared to the total revenue. Additionally, the cost of goods sold for the quarter and full year was $20 million and $58 million, respectively, which is a significant portion of the revenue.

The R&D expense for the quarter was $162 million, including $17 million in non-cash stock compensation. For the full year, the R&D expense was $582 million, including $60 million in non-cash stock compensation. The company also recorded $7 million in expenses related to the change in the fair market value of the contingent consideration for the Iclusig royalty liability in the fourth quarter and $17 million for the full year. These expenses, along with other one-time items, resulted in less profitability.

Looking at the 2017 guidance, Incyte expects net product revenue from Jakafi to be in the range of $1.02 billion to $1.07 billion and for Iclusig, the expected net product revenue is in the range of $60 million to $65 million. However, the company also expects to incur significant ongoing R&D expenses, including one-time expenses associated with collaborations, resulting in a total R&D expense in the range of $785 million to $835 million. SG&A expense for 2017 is expected to be in the range of $340 million to $360 million, including non-cash expense related to employee equity awards. 

Given the high R&D and SG&A expenses, as well as the moderate profitability in the previous year, it is recommended that investors adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for Incyte. The company's financial metrics suggest that potential returns may not justify the level of risk associated with the investment.
