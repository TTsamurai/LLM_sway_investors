Based on the recent earnings call, there are several factors that suggest a cautious or skeptical stance on investing in Incyte. 

First, while the company reported strong revenue growth in 2016, it is important to note that some of this revenue was attributed to milestone payments and royalties from collaborations and partnerships with other companies. This raises questions about the sustainability of the revenue growth from their core products, Jakafi and Iclusig.

Additionally, the company's R&D expenses for 2017 are expected to increase significantly, due to one-time expenses associated with new collaborations with Agenus, Merus and Calithera. The upfront cash payments and stock investments in these collaborations will result in a substantial increase in R&D expenses in the first quarter of 2017. This suggests a potential strain on the company's financials and raises concerns about their ability to manage expenses effectively.

Furthermore, the guidance for net income in 2017 shows variability due to the uncertainty surrounding achievement and timing of milestones from their collaborations. This uncertainty may make it difficult for investors to predict future earnings and create instability in the company's financial performance.

These factors, combined with the potential impact of higher R&D and SG&A expenses, suggest that an underweight investment stance may be appropriate for Incyte at this time. It is important to carefully evaluate the company's financials and future prospects before making any investment decisions.
