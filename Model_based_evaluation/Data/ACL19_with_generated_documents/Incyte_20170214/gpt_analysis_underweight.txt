Based on the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended that the company be given an 'underweight' investment stance. The revenue and net income figures for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016 show strong performance, driven mainly by Jakafi net product revenue. However, there are significant expenses, including R&D expenses and one-time expenses associated with collaborations with Agenus, Merus, and Calithera, which will impact profitability in 2017.

The company's 2017 guidance expects milestone payments to add significantly to total revenue, but there is inherent uncertainty with respect to the achievement and timing of these milestones, which may create variability in net income on a quarterly basis. The significant one-time R&D expenses in the first quarter and ongoing R&D expenses for the advancement of products in the pipeline, including Phase 3 studies of epacadostat and co-funding additional indications for baricitinib with Lilly, will also impact profits.

Additionally, expenses for ongoing operations, including SG&A expenses and non-cash expenses related to employee equity awards, are expected to increase in 2017 due to the inclusion of European operations for the first full year. The company also expects variability in net income due to the uncertainty of milestone achievement and timing.

In conclusion, while the company has a strong cash position and operating income to execute its strategies, there are uncertainties and significant expenses that may impact profitability in 2017. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended.
