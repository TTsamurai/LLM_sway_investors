Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on Incyte Corporation. The company's performance in the fourth quarter and 2016 was strong, with $326 million in total revenue in the fourth quarter and $1.1 billion for the full year. Key drivers for 2017 guidance include anticipated milestone payments, approval of baricitinib in Europe, ongoing R&D expenses, and one-time expenses associated with collaborations with Agenus, Merus, and Calithera. Net product revenue for Jakafi is expected to be between $1.02 billion to $1.07 billion, with a gross to net adjustment of approximately 13%. The company expects total cost of goods sold to be in the range of $75 million to $80 million and ongoing R&D expenses to be in the range of $785 million to $835 million, including non-cash expenses.

Overall, Incyte is well-positioned from a cash and operating income perspective, and has a broad portfolio of late-stage assets with the potential to drive significant momentum and value over the next several years. The company also has plans for further geographic expansion into the Asia Pacific region. With the expectation of growth and value creation in 2017 and beyond, it is recommended to consider an 'overweight' investment stance in Incyte Corporation.
