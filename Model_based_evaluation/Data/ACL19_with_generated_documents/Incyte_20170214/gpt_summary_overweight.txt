Investment Stance:
Based on the financial performance and the guidance provided for 2017, I recommend adopting an 'overweight' investment stance for Incyte. The company's strong revenue growth, cash position, and ongoing R&D activities indicate potential for future growth and increased shareholder value. In addition, the anticipation of milestone payments from collaboration partners and ongoing R&D expense for the development of the product pipeline provide opportunities for additional revenue generation and value creation.
