Based on the recent earnings call, I highly recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on KLA-Tencor. The company's recent financial performance and operational execution in the March quarter were outstanding. Key highlights include shipments, revenue, and earnings per share finishing above the midpoint of guidance, driven by strong demand across the product portfolio and solid cost management and operational execution. With total shipments reaching a record of $909 million and expected to continue at record levels, the company's revenue outlook is strong, with expectations for continued growth in the second half of the year. Additionally, KLA-Tencor's market leadership and industry-leading business model position the company for greater-than-market growth in 2017, with the WFE industry environment forecasted to grow mid-single-digits or higher.

The company's product drivers for growth in 2018 include the full shrink to 7-nanometer technology, multi-patterning schemes, and process window challenges, which are expected to drive process control intensity per wafer up by approximately 20%. Furthermore, the company's ongoing investment in 3D NAND and EUV inspection and metrology opportunities will contribute to future growth.

In terms of expenses, KLA-Tencor is making incremental investments to capitalize on growth opportunities, with additional investments in inspection and metrology for 3D NAND and EUV development activities, as well as increased variable compensation expense due to the company's strengthened performance outlook. However, the company is committed to its operating model and targets, with a focus on generating sustainable gross margin that exceeds published business model targets.

Overall, KLA-Tencor's strong performance, market leadership, and growth outlook make it an attractive investment opportunity, justifying an 'overweight' investment stance.
