Based on the recent earnings call of KLA-Tencor, there are several indicators that suggest caution when considering an investment in the company. Despite the positive financial performance and operational execution, there are some key points to consider:

1. Shift in Order Commentary: The company has announced that they will discontinue all formal order commentary, which may impact investors' ability to gauge the future performance and demand for the company's products.

2. Foundry Orders: While foundry orders were strong in the March quarter, there is uncertainty about the future distribution of orders, with a forecasted decrease in the June quarter.

3. Revenue and Margins: The company expects revenue to be reliant on the successful execution of product roadmaps supporting 3D NAND and EUV inspection and metrology opportunities, which may pose some risk.

4. Increased Expenses: There is a planned increase in operating expenses for 2017 due to incremental investments in product roadmaps and higher variable compensation expenses, which may impact profitability.

5. Future Outlook: Although the company's outlook for 2018 looks positive, there are challenges and uncertainties in terms of process control intensity, technology adoption, and margin sustainability.

While there are opportunities for growth and expansion, the cautionary factors mentioned above suggest an 'underweight' investment stance for KLA-Tencor based on the recent earnings call. Investors should carefully assess the potential risks and uncertainties before making any investment decision.
