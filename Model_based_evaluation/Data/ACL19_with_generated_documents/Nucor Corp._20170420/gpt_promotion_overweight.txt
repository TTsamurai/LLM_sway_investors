Recommendation: 
Based on the company's recent earnings call, Nucor is showing significant improvement in earnings compared to previous quarters, with a strong financial position and a positive outlook for the second quarter of 2017. The company's strong liquidity position and proactive approach to trade issues demonstrate its ability to navigate challenges in the steel industry. Additionally, the expected improvement in pricing and demand for steel products in the second quarter further supports a positive outlook for Nucor. As such, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Nucor, as the company's competitive advantages, adaptable business model, and proven strategies position it for profitable long-term growth and attractive returns for shareholders.
