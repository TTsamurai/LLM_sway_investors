Based on the recent earnings call, Nucor seems to be in a strong financial position with significant improvement in earnings compared to previous quarters. The company's steel mills segment, raw materials segment, and tax rate all showed positive improvement. Additionally, Nucor's strong liquidity, low debt ratio, and expected increase in earnings for the second quarter of 2017 indicate a positive outlook for the company.

However, it is important to note that while the company's performance has improved, imports continue to negatively impact the U.S. steel industry, and there are still trade issues that need to be addressed. Additionally, the company's perspective on pricing and costs for the second quarter suggests that there may be challenges in maintaining the same level of profitability.

Therefore, based on the cautious perspective offered in the recent earnings call and the potential challenges in the industry, it may be prudent to recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on Nucor at this time. While the company has shown improvement, there are still significant external factors that could impact its future performance.
