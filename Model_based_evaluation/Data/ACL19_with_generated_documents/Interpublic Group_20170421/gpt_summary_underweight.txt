Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, there are several key financial metrics that point to a "underweight" investment stance for this company. 

Firstly, the organic revenue growth for the company was 2.7% in the first quarter, with a slight increase in the US and a 2.2% increase in international markets. While the growth is positive, it is not significant enough to warrant an "overweight" investment stance.

The Q1 operating profit was $30 million, showing an increase of $7 million compared to the previous year. However, the diluted EPS of $0.05 is not substantial enough to indicate strong financial performance.

The revenue by region shows inconsistent organic growth rates, with the Asia Pac region experiencing a 2.7% decrease. Additionally, the company noted challenges in shifting existing clients into agency relationships, which could potentially impact future revenues.

The company's cash flow also raises concerns. While cash used in operations decreased compared to the previous year, the company's working capital cash flows still resulted in a net decrease in cash and marketable securities.

Furthermore, the company's debt deleveraging has not been significant, with debt levels decreasing only marginally from a peak of $2.33 billion in 2007 to $1.92 billion at the most recent quarter-end.

Overall, while the company has shown some positive financial metrics, the various inconsistencies and challenges in revenue growth, cash flow, and debt deleveraging suggest that an "underweight" investment stance is appropriate at this time.
