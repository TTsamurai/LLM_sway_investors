Based on the recent earnings call, the company has shown solid revenue growth and profit performance in the first quarter, which represents a good start in achieving their financial objectives for the full year. The organic revenue growth was 2.7%, with the US and international markets both showing positive growth. The operating profit increased by $7 million compared to the previous year in the seasonally small first quarter. The diluted EPS also increased to $0.05 compared to $0.01 reported last year.

Revenue in the first quarter was $1.75 billion, with organic growth of 2.7%. The US organic growth was 2.9% and international markets showed mixed results, with the UK, Continental Europe, and LatAm all showing positive organic growth, while Asia Pac had a decrease in organic growth.

Operating expenses increased by 30 basis points compared to reported revenue growth of 70 basis points, resulting in an operating margin expansion of 40 basis points. Cash used in operations was $372 million, compared to $654 million the previous year, showing an improvement in cash flow.

With solid revenue growth and profit performance, and a continued focus on investing in growth areas such as digital, media, advertising, and PR, the company is well-positioned for future success. Based on these positive results, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company.
