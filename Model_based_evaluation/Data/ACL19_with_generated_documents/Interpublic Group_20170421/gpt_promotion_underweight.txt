Based on the earnings call, it is clear that the company experienced organic revenue growth of 2.7% in the first quarter, with operating profit increasing by $7 million compared to the previous year. However, there are several reasons for caution in considering an investment in this company.

First, the company's revenue growth was negatively impacted by changes in exchange rates and net dispositions, resulting in a marginal increase of 70 basis points as reported. Additionally, the company experienced a decrease in organic growth in the Asia Pac region, which reflected lower client spending in China and Australia.

Furthermore, the company's total operating expenses increased by 30 basis points from the previous year, compared to reported revenue growth of 70 basis points. While the operating margin did expand by 40 basis points, this increase was due to improved leverage on salaries and related expenses, rather than significant cost management.

The company's cash flow also raises concerns, with a significant use of cash in the first quarter for working capital. While this is typical for the company's seasonal cash flow patterns, it is important to note that investing activities used $33 million in the quarter, including $25 million of CapEx, indicating significant investment needs.

Additionally, the company's debt deleveraging from a peak of $2.33 billion in 2007 to $1.92 billion at the most recent quarter-end is worth noting, but it still indicates a considerable level of debt.

Overall, while the company's solid revenue growth and profit performance in the quarter may seem positive, these cautionary factors suggest a more conservative approach to investment. Therefore, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company based on the recent earnings call.
