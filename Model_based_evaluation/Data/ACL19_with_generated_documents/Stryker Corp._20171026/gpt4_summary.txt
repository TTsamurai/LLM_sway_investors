2. **Earnings Per Share (EPS):**
   - Adjusted quarterly EPS increased by 9.4% to $1.52, positively influenced by strong sales volumes and favorable effective tax rates.

   - Adjusted Operating Margin was reported at 24.2% of sales, down 70 basis points from the previous year, significantly influenced by the one-time items.

5. **Tax Rates and Financial Position:**
   - The adjusted effective tax rate was notably favorable at 14.6% due to changes in accounting for stock compensation and geographical income benefits.

   - The company anticipates full-year organic sales growth to be between 6.5% to 7%.
   - Adjusted net earnings per diluted share for the year are expected to range between $6.45 to $6.50, considering the impacts of the Sage product actions and weather disruptions.
   - Q4 is expected to mirror the strong historical sales performance typical of this quarter, potentially offsetting some of the earlier disruptions observed in Q3.

**Noteworthy Impacts and Additional Considerations:**
   - There were notable disruptions due to the Sage product recall and hurricanes which impacted organic growth and profitability metrics. However, management expects to recover some of these impacts in Q4.
   - The NOVADAQ acquisition was noted as dilutive to the yearâ€™s EPS by approximately $0.05 but is expected to neutralize by the following year.

**Potential Areas of Concern:**
   - Continued pressure from unfavorable pricing and product disruptions.
   - Operational risks related to weather impacts and manufacturing disruptions need careful monitoring.

**Closing Remarks:**
Overall, despite facing certain headwinds from product recalls and extreme weather, the management demonstrates a strategic approach to sustaining growth momentum across key segments, maintaining robust financial health, and providing a cautiously optimistic outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year.
