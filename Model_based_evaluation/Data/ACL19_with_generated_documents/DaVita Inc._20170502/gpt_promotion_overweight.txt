Based on the recent earnings call and the company's performance, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on our company's stock. The Kidney Care segment showed a 3.8% growth in the first quarter of the year, which falls within the company's long-term expectations. The adjusted operating income for the quarter was $380 million, impacted by normal seasonal factors such as flu season and higher payroll taxes, as well as other factors outlined in the 2017 guidance. Despite these headwinds, the company experienced some tailwinds, including a government settlement and a recent renegotiated contract with Amgen. The company also closed the acquisition of Renal Ventures, which is already incorporated into the 2017 guidance, and extended its partnership with Humana to provide integrated care services to their members. Additionally, the DMG segment is experiencing the benefits as expected, and the company continues to monitor the political landscape and represent dialysis patients in discussions around healthcare in the country. Overall, the company's outlook remains positive, and I recommend an 'overweight' stance on our stock based on the recent earnings call.
