Based on the recent earnings call, the company's performance in Q1 appears to be in line with expectations, with a 3.8% growth in non-acquired revenue and adjusted operating income of $380 million. However, there are several factors that could impact the company's future performance. These include lower enrollment on patients on the ACA plans, an increase in clinical teammate wages, a decline in adjusted operating income in the pharmacy operations, and forecasted commercial rate decreases later in the year.

Additionally, the company has undergone a government settlement, acquired Renal Ventures, and extended its partnership with Humana. These changes will incur some one-time costs to integrate the business and may impact the company's financial performance in the short term.

The company also acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding healthcare reforms and the potential impact on their business. This greater uncertainty raises concerns about the company's future performance and necessitates caution when considering an investment in the company.

In summary, the company's recent earnings call indicates potential headwinds and uncertainties that could impact its financial performance. Given these factors, I would recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company.
