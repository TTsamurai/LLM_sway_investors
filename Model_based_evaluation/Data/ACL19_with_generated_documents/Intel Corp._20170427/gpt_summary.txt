 is consistent with what we've put out there. So, we feel good about where we are on gross margins on a full year basis, and it's a small plus based on what we've seen in the first 90 days of the year.

In summary, Intel had a strong financial performance in the first quarter of 2017, achieving record revenue of $14.8 billion, a 7% year-over-year increase. Operating income was $3.9 billion, up 20% year over year, with earnings per share of $0.66, up 22% year over year. The company's EPS performance was a result of strong top line growth and significant margin expansion. First quarter operating margin was 27%, up 3 points year over year, and gross margin came in at 63%, up 0.5 points year over year.

The Client Computing Group had revenue of $8 billion, up 6% year over year, with Client ASPs up 7% year over year. The Data Center Group had revenue of $4.2 billion, up 6% year over year, and the Internet of Things business achieved revenue of $721 million, growing 11% year over year. The Memory business had record revenue of $866 million, up 55% year over year, while the Programmable Solutions Group had revenue of $425 million. The Intel Security Group had revenue of $534 million and operating profit was $95 million. Intel's capital allocation priorities include investing in the business, strategic acquisitions, and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.

For the second quarter of 2017, Intel is forecasting a revenue range of $14.4 billion, up 11% year over year excluding Intel Security and up 6% including Intel Security. Operating margins are expected to increase by 3 points year over year, with gross margins at approximately 63% and spending at approximately $5.2 billion, flat year over year. EPS is expected to be approximately $0.68, up 15% year over year.

Intel is committed to increasing efficiency as a company and aims to reduce its spending as a percent of revenue by 2 points from 2015 to 2017, with a target spending of approximately 30% of revenue to be reached no later than 2020. As a result, the company has raised its full-year revenue guidance by $500 million to approximately $60 billion and its EPS guidance by $0.05 to approximately $2.85 per share. Intel is also focused on growing earnings performance for the company in the short, medium, and long term, with a three-year plan for low single digit growth, operating income growing faster than revenue, and EPS growing faster than operating income.

In terms of capital expenditure, Intel's spending is expected to roughly flat during the course of the year, with SG&A indirect costs decreasing and R&D costs increasing. Intel's overall cost will be roughly flat, with the Data Center Group receiving a larger portion due to its bigger size and the decision to have it be a beneficiary of Moore's Law sooner than it has historically. The company has authorized a $10 billion increase in its share buyback authorization and expects to continue to offset dilution from stock-based programs and opportunistically reduce its outstanding share count over time.

Overall, Intel's financial performance in the first quarter and its outlook for the second quarter and full year show strong growth and a focus on efficiency and profitability. The company's commitment to increasing efficiency, capital allocation priorities, and long-term growth strategy demonstrate a solid financial foundation for the future.
