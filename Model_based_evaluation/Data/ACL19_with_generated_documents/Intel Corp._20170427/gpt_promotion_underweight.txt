Based on the recent earnings call of Intel, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. Despite the positive financial numbers presented on the call, there are several factors that indicate caution and skepticism. These include the increased allocation of technology development and SG&A costs impacting operating margins, the decline in operating profit for the Data Center Group, and the operating loss in the Memory business. Additionally, the company's planned reduction in spending as a percent of revenue by 2020 raises questions about potential impacts on future growth and innovation. Finally, the projected increase in capital expenditures and the potential impact on free cash flow also warrant a cautious approach to investment in Intel.
