, we don't see a lot of deviation. So, we continue to feel good about where the dynamics play out for the full-year gross margin performance. Overall, we remain optimistic about the future growth and profitability of Intel. The strong financial performance in the first quarter and the positive outlook for the year, with revenue and EPS guidance revised upwards, signal the company's continued momentum and potential for long-term success. The increase in share buyback authorization by $10 billion further demonstrates the commitment to returning cash to shareholders and the strength of the company's financial position. With strong top line growth, significant margin expansion, and a focus on increasing efficiency in how the business operates, we anticipate continued positive performance for Intel in the near future. As a result, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance in Intel, based on the company's strong financial metrics and positive outlook.
