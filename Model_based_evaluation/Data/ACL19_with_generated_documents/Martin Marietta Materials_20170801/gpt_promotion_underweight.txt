. Thank you for joining the earnings call, I hope you found the information useful. Although the company achieved record results in the second quarter, there are some potential concerns and challenges that should be noted. The impact of weather and other uncontrollable headwinds on the business was evident in the volume flow for the quarter, particularly in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions. There were also significant precipitation-related production costs and other operational challenges, which affected the bottom line. Additionally, there were some unique factors affecting pricing and cost control in specific market segments.

The company's outlook for the rest of the year and beyond is positive, but it is important to consider potential risks and uncertainties. While there are promising indicators of demand and market growth, it's essential to be cautious about the potential impact of weather-related disruptions, regulatory considerations, and potential delays in construction activity. The company's performance in key markets such as Texas and Colorado also presents specific challenges that merit careful monitoring.

Overall, considering the potential challenges and uncertainties, I would recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company at this time. It's important to conduct further analysis and closely monitor the company's performance in the coming months. Thank you for your attention, and I'm available to discuss this report further if needed.
