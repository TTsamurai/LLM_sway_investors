. Thank you for joining today's earnings conference call. Based on the information from the call, it is clear that Martin Marietta achieved second quarter records for net sales, earnings from operations, and earnings per diluted share. The company has announced the acquisition of Bluegrass Materials Company, which aligns with its strategic growth plan and is expected to have a positive impact on future growth. The company is also focused on returning to target debt levels within the next 12 to 18 months, demonstrating a commitment to financial discipline.

The company has demonstrated resilience in the face of weather-related challenges, with continued growth in residential and non-residential construction activity across its key markets. Pricing and volume increases in the aggregates, cement, and ready-mixed concrete product lines have contributed to record second quarter gross profit. Despite the impact of weather, the company remains optimistic about the long-term outlook for the construction sector.

Looking ahead, there are expectations of steady growth in construction activity and increasing infrastructure investments. The company is committed to disciplined capital allocation, which includes strategic acquisitions, organic capital investment, and returning cash to shareholders.

In conclusion, Martin Marietta's strong financial performance, strategic growth plan, and a positive outlook for construction activity indicate resilience and potential for future success. Based on the financial information and strategic insights from the earnings call, adopting an 'underweight' investment stance may be warranted due to potential challenges related to weather, labor market constraints, and potential delays in infrastructure projects. It is advisable to closely monitor the company's ability to meet volume expectations and manage costs in the coming quarters.
