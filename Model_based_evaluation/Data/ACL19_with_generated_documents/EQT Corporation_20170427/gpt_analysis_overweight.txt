Based on the insights from the conference call transcript and the financial metrics provided, I am inclined to maintain an 'overweight' investment stance on EQT Corporation.

Firstly, the company's recent acreage acquisitions, particularly in the Marcellus core, showcase a strong commitment to expanding their position in lucrative markets. This strategic move not only positions the company for long-term growth but also indicates confidence in the potential of these assets.

The significant improvement in pricing and realized prices, along with the projected improvement in basis and access to premium markets, bode well for the company's revenue and profitability. This is further supported by the 33% increase in average realized price, which reflects a favorable pricing environment.

Furthermore, the increase in production sales volume and operating revenues, combined with a robust liquidity position, provide a strong foundation for future expansion and investment. The company's forecasted operating cash flow for 2017, alongside the available debt capacity and equity markets, offers flexibility in funding potential future acquisitions.

Additionally, the management's commitment to maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet and their ability to manage the debt-to-equity mix demonstrate responsible financial management practices.

In conclusion, based on the company's recent financial performance, strategic acquisitions, and future outlook, I believe that EQT Corporation presents a compelling investment opportunity and warrants an 'overweight' investment stance.
