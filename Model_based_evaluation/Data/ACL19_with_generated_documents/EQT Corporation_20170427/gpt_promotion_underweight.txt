Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take a cautious or skeptical stance on investing in EQT Corporation. The company has shown an increase in production sales volume, but the operating expenses have also increased. The increased transportation expenses and higher processing costs have driven higher transportation costs and higher realized prices. Furthermore, the company has acquired significant acreage and is actively consolidating its acreage position, which may lead to increased expenses and potential financial strain in the future. Additionally, while the company has a strong liquidity position, it is important to note that maintaining an investment grade balance sheet is crucial for the company. Overall, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on EQT Corporation based on the recent earnings call and the potential financial risks associated with their expansion and acquisition strategies.
