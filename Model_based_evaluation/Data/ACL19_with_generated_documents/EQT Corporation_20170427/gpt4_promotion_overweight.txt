### **Investment Report: Overweight Recommendation on EQT Corporation**

#### **Executive Summary**
Based on EQT Corporation's (NYSE: EQT) first-quarter earnings call of 2017, we are issuing a recommendation to overweight EQT stock in investment portfolios. This recommendation is informed by the company's strong financial performance, strategic acreage acquisitions, improved pricing environment, and solid operational advancements which signal potential for substantial growth and profitability.

#### **Key Investment Highlights**

1. **Strategic Acreage Acquisitions**:
   - EQT has significantly expanded its core operational footprint with the addition of 67,400 Marcellus acres for $652 million, funded by cash reserves. This makes EQT the top acquirer of Marcellus acres since 2015, with over 222,000 net acres added, bolstering its production capabilities and long-term reserve potential.

2. **Improved Pricing and Market Access**:
   - The average realized price including cash-settled derivatives increased by 33% year-over-year to $3.50 per Mcfe. Additionally, the negative differential improved, and further improvements are expected due to upcoming pipeline projects like the MVP pipeline. This will grant EQT access to premium Southeast markets, potentially boosting profitability.

3. **Robust Financial Performance**:
   - Adjusted earnings surged to $0.43 per diluted share from $0.05 in the same period last year.
   - Adjusted operating cash flow increased to $322 million from $217 million.
   - Net income attributable to non-controlling interests was significantly up, indicating robust subsidiary performance.

4. **Operational Excellence**:
   - Production sales volume saw a 6% increase despite a lower-than-planned number of completed wells, underscoring efficient resource management.
   - Increased utilization of owned transportation capacity led to higher transportation costs but was offset by higher realized prices and improved market access.

5. **Financial Health and Liquidity**:
   - EQT reported excellent liquidity with zero net short-term debt, about $857 million in cash on hand, and $1.5 billion in available credit. The company is well-positioned to fund its projected $1.5 billion CapEx for 2017 while maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet.

#### **Forward-Looking Statements**

EQT expects increased volumes and potentially lower per unit costs in the second half of the year. The company continues to focus on maintaining its investment-grade rating and has both debt and equity options available to fund future growth efficiently. Continued enhancements in infrastructure and capacity utilization are expected to further improve pricing and margins.

#### **Conclusion**

Given EQT Corporationâ€™s strategic acquisitions, improved market positioning, solid financial metrics, and robust operational improvements, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance. This recommendation recognizes the company's potential for above-market returns driven by sustained improvements in operational and financial performance.

Investors are encouraged to consider increasing their stake in EQT Corporation, expecting the company to outperform the broader market and deliver substantial shareholder value in the medium to long term.
