Based on the transcript, it is evident that EQT Corporation has made significant acquisitions and has seen improvement in its pricing environment. The company recorded adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.43 in the first quarter of 2017, which is a significant increase from the $0.05 in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating cash flow also increased to $322 million from $217 million in the first quarter of 2016.

However, it is important to note that the total operating expenses at EQT Production were $571.2 million, which is a 17% increase quarter over quarter. Transmission expenses were $43.4 million higher due to volumes moved on the Rockies Express Pipeline and the Ohio Valley Connector. Additionally, processing expenses were $16.7 million higher, and production taxes were $6.2 million higher. These increased expenses are a cause for concern.

Furthermore, it is crucial to consider the company's future funding plans, as the company aims to maintain an investment-grade balance sheet. While the company has debt capacity and equity markets available, it would be wise to closely monitor the debt-to-equity mix to ensure the company stays on the right side of the rating agencies.

Considering the increased operating expenses and the need for careful management of the debt-to-equity mix, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on EQT Corporation. The company's financial metrics, particularly the significant increase in operating expenses, indicate potential challenges in the future that may impact its financial performance and stock valuation.
