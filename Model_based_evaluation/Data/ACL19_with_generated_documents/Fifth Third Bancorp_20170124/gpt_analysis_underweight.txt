Key insights and financial metrics from the earnings conference call transcript suggest that the company's financial performance for the quarter was positive, with an expansion in net interest margin, controlled expenses, and excellent credit quality. However, there were deliberate exits from certain commercial lending relationships, leading to a decline in the total loan portfolio. The company also expects modest growth in the consumer loan portfolio. Fee income is expected to grow in 2018 and beyond, as initiatives are in the execution phase. Expenses are well managed, and the company expects to achieve positive operating leverage in 2017. The company's capital levels remain strong, with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.4%. The company is optimistic about achieving a return on tangible common equity of 12-14% through a combination of expense saves, balance sheet, and fee income growth. Overall, while the company's financial performance has been positive, the deliberate exits from certain lending relationships and modest loan growth outlook suggest a cautious approach. Therefore, it is advised to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company.
