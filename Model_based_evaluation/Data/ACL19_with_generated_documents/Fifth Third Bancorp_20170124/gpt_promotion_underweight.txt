Based on the information provided in the recent earnings call, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on this company. Here are some reasons:

- Although the company reported positive financial results for the quarter, there are concerns about the impact of certain items on the net interest margin, such as pre-tax charges and credit card refunds. This may indicate potential instability in earnings.

- The deliberate decision to exit certain commercial lending relationships and reduce indirect auto-loan originations led to a sequential decline in the total loan portfolio. This indicates a cautious approach to loan growth.

- While the company aims to grow total commercial loans by 4% to 5% in 2017, there are concerns about the impact of the deliberate relationship exits on loan growth. Additionally, the company expects a decline in the auto loan portfolio.

- The company's expenses were well managed in the fourth quarter, but there are concerns about elevated expenses in the first quarter of 2017 due to timing of certain expenses, including an increase in long-term compensation awards.

Overall, the company's cautious approach to loan growth, potential instability in net interest margin, and the expectation of elevated expenses in the first quarter of 2017 lead to a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company. Therefore, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance.
