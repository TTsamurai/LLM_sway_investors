Based on the information from the transcript, the key financial metrics of the company are positive despite some challenges. The net interest margin (NIM) expanded sequentially, expenses were tightly controlled, and credit quality was excellent. The average loan portfolio decreased due to deliberate decisions to exit certain lending relationships that did not meet the desired risk and return profile. However, the company plans to grow total commercial loans by 4% to 5% in 2017. Fee income is expected to remain stable in the first quarter, with potential growth in mortgage banking and corporate banking fees in the future. Expenses are expected to be up 1% compared to 2016, but the company is focused on achieving positive operating leverage in 2017 and is making strategic investments for future revenue growth in 2018 and beyond.

The company's capital levels remain strong, with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 10.4%. The company is confident in its ability to generate capital and intends to maintain stable capital ratios. The early adoption of an accounting change had a positive impact on taxes in the fourth quarter, and the company expects its tax rate to be in the mid-25% range for 2017.

Overall, the company's outlook is positive, with expectations for improved financial performance and stable credit quality. The focus on strategic initiatives and cost management is expected to support future revenue growth, and the company remains committed to achieving positive operating leverage and maintaining strong capital levels. Considering these factors, an 'overweight' investment stance seems appropriate given the company's potential for continued growth and stability in the future.
