The company's year-to-date revenue growth is at 4.5%, which is in line with its full-year guidance range. It also expects to drive 200 to 225 basis points of margin expansion for the fiscal year. The company is confident in its ability to achieve its full-year fiscal 2017 currency-neutral adjusted EPS guidance of $9.70 to $9.80, representing underlying growth of 15% to 17%, despite the headwinds from the U.S. dispensing change and FX pressure. The company has a strong outlook for the future, with expected revenue synergies and cost synergies from a recent acquisition. Emerging markets growth is strong, and the company foresees a rebound in the Diabetes Care segment, as well as solid momentum in its core business.
