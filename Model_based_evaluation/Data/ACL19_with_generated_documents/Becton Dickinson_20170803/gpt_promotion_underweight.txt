. So, we'll call it a generally flat environment on the pricing. And that continues as we look forward into the end of the year. So, as you mentioned, we did say that pricing was a headwind in the quarter, but it wasn't significant. Sure, I can give you some color on that. So, our revenues grew 2.4% on a comparable currency-neutral basis, which was slightly below our expectations. The U.S. dispensing change lowered total company revenue growth by approximately 100 basis points, in line with our previously-communicated expectations. We estimate that the U.S. dispensing change lowered BD Medical U.S. revenue growth by approximately 270 basis points and total company U.S. growth by approximately 200 basis points. Accounting for the dispensing change and the timing of items within the year, our third quarter results would have been in the low end of our full-year guidance range of 4.5% to 5%. On a currency-neutral basis, adjusted EPS of $2.46 grew 7.7%, which was impacted by the divestiture of the Respiratory Solutions business, as well as the U.S. Dispensing business model change, resulting in a combined headwind of approximately 600 basis points to EPS growth. Given this information, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company based on the recent earnings call. Despite strong underlying performance, the impact of the U.S. dispensing change and other headwinds has affected revenue and EPS growth. We advise caution and believe that an underweight investment stance is appropriate at this time.
