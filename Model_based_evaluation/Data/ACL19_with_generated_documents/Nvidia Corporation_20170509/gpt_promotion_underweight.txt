Based on the recent earnings call, the company's Q1 results were impressive with record revenue and significant growth across all four platforms: gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive. However, it is important to note that the company's Q1 revenue was down 11% sequentially, reflecting a potential slowdown in growth. Additionally, the impact of the expiry of the Intel licensing agreement is expected to have a negative impact on the company's gross margins in the coming quarters. While the company is optimistic about the data center business, it is still too early to predict the exact impact on each of the business segments. Therefore, it may be prudent to take a cautious or underweight investment stance on the company for the time being.
