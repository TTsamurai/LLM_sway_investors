 in our recent earnings call. Our company has seen significant growth in all of our platforms, from gaming to data center to automotive. The demand for our GPUs in AI and cloud computing has driven substantial increases in revenue, as well as partnerships with major companies such as Microsoft, Facebook, and Bosch. Additionally, the growth in e-sports and the continued success of AAA gaming titles have contributed to strong sales in our gaming platforms. We also anticipate significant growth in our data center business, with increasing demand from cloud service providers and enterprises, as well as partnerships with major research centers and universities. Our automotive revenue has also seen substantial growth, driven primarily by infotainment modules and partnerships with leading auto suppliers and truck makers. Our financials for the first quarter reflect the strong growth in revenue and net income, as well as a promising outlook for the second quarter. We anticipate further growth in revenue, gross margins, and operating income, driven by the continued demand for our products and the expansion of our AI and cloud computing platforms. We are confident in the company's ability to deliver value to shareholders, as evidenced by our plan to return approximately $1.25 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends for fiscal 2018. We believe that the company's recent performance and future outlook make it an attractive investment opportunity, warranting an 'overweight' investment stance.
