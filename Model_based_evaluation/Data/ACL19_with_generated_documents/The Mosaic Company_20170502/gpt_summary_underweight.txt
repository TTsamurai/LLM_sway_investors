Dear stakeholder,

Our recent earnings conference call transcript reveals several concerning issues that lead us to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance. The key financial metrics presented in the call demonstrate a range of challenges and potential setbacks in the upcoming quarters.

In the Phosphates segment, the margin rate was below guidance due to an unplanned mechanical issue at the Faustina Louisiana ammonia plant, resulting in a negative impact on gross margin of $14 million or 1.7 percentage points. Additionally, weather-related issues in the joint venture mine in Peru also impacted operations. While the guidance for the second quarter reflects higher selling prices and robust shipments, it is expected to be negatively impacted by higher ammonia costs and ongoing operational challenges.

Similarly, the Potash business was impacted by the incident with a skip at the Esterhazy K2 mine, reducing second quarter shipments and leading to a shortfall in margin rate and margin dollars. The lower than expected sales volumes and logistics issues also affected per unit profitability.

The International Distribution segment fared relatively better, with results generally in line with guidance. However, the changes in depreciation method and increased focus on mechanical integrity and capital expenditures may have a significant non-cash P&L benefit in 2017 from a reduction in depreciation expense.

The Vale Fertilizantes acquisition also presents potential financing challenges with plans to issue debt for the purchase price in the late summer, as well as upcoming changes in segment reporting post close.

In conclusion, the various operational challenges and market uncertainties highlighted in the conference call transcript lead us to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance. We remain concerned about the potential impact on future profitability and the need for careful monitoring of the company's performance in the coming quarters.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
