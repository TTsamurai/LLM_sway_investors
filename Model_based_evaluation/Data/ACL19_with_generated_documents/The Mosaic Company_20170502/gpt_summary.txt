From the conference call transcript, several key financial metrics and issues were highlighted. Here are the main points:

1. Phosphates segment:
- Shipment volumes at the top end of guidance range due to strong global demand and expectations of a strong spring application season in North America.
- Prices in the middle of guidance range and operating rate at 79%.
- Margin rate below guidance due to unplanned mechanical issue at Faustina Louisiana ammonia plant, resulting in a $14 million or 1.7 percentage point negative impact on gross margin.

2. Potash segment:
- Incident with a skip at Esterhazy K2 mine led to lower than expected operating rates and shipment volumes.
- Potash gross margin rate fell short of guidance due to costs associated with the skip incident and lower sales volumes.

3. International Distribution segment:
- Results were generally in line with guidance, with 1.3 million tonnes of product sold and a gross margin per tonne of $21.

4. Depreciation method change:
- Company changed depreciation method to units-of-production method for certain mining assets, resulting in an approximate $70 million non-cash P&L benefit in 2017.

5. Vale Fertilizantes acquisition:
- Planning to issue debt to finance the cash portion of the purchase price in the late summer timeframe.
- Expect to change segment reporting post-close, providing historical detail.

6. Gross margin guidance:
- Phosphates segment: Expecting approximately 10% gross margin for the second quarter, improving in the second half.
- Potash segment: Expecting margins to improve to the low 20% range for the second quarter.

7. Ammonia costs and new vessel:
- Expecting ammonia costs to continue running higher in the Phosphates segment in the second quarter.
- Anticipating benefits from the commissioning of a new ammonia vessel to keep down world ammonia prices for the phosphate business.

8. Depreciation change and asset useful life:
- Reviewed asset classifications and extended the useful life of some assets due to capital expenditures and mechanical integrity program.

9. Production ramp-up:
- New project to start producing phosphate in the second half of 2017, with estimated production of 300,000 to 500,000 tonnes this year and ramping up in 2018.

10. Depreciation and amortization (D&A) figures:
- In Q1 of 2017, D&A was $159 million, compared to $184 million in the same quarter a year ago.
