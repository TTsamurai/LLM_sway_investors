Based on the recent conference call transcript, the company has faced several challenges in the Phosphates and Potash segments due to unplanned mechanical issues, weather-related issues, and logistics issues. These issues have impacted the company's gross margin rate and resulted in higher costs, particularly in the Phosphates segment. However, the company expects a gradual improvement in the second half of the year due to higher industry stripping margins, improved cost control, and more normal operating rates.

In the Phosphates segment, the company expects realized DAP prices to range from $320 to $340 per tonne with volumes in the range of 2.3 million to 2.6 million tonnes in the second quarter. Gross margin is expected to improve to approximately 10%. In the Potash business, the company expects shipment volumes in the range of 2.0 million to 2.3 million tonnes with prices expected to rise modestly to a range of $170 to $185 per tonne, and margins are expected to improve to the low 20% range.

The company also mentioned a change in depreciation method to a units-of-production method for certain mining assets, which is expected to result in an approximate $70 million non-cash P&L benefit in 2017.

It is important to note the company's plans to issue debt to finance the cash portion of the Vale Fertilizantes acquisition and the potential change in segment reporting post-close.

Overall, despite the challenges faced in the first quarter, the company's outlook for the future indicates a gradual improvement in margins and profitability, particularly in the second half of the year. Given the company's focus on cost control and expected improvements in market environment and pricing, an 'overweight' investment stance may be justified for the long-term. However, investors should closely monitor the company's ability to address and mitigate the operational and market challenges mentioned in the transcript.
