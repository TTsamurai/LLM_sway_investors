and it will give you some context, so this change in depreciation method has resulted in a significant reduction in our depreciation expense. As discussed, our segment performance in the Phosphates business was impacted by higher ammonia costs due to an unplanned mechanical issue at our Faustina Louisiana ammonia plant. This had a negative impact on our gross margin by $14 million or 1.7 percentage points. However, with the completion of the scheduled turnaround at the plant, we expect ammonia costs to continue to run higher in the second quarter but anticipate an improvement in gross margin to approximately 10%.

In the Potash business, an incident with a skip at the Esterhazy K2 mine resulted in lower-than-expected operating rates and reduced our second quarter shipments by approximately 200,000 tonnes. Furthermore, Canpotex-related logistics issues led to lower sales volumes and reduced per unit profitability, resulting in a gross margin rate that fell short of our guidance. For the second quarter, we expect Potash shipment volumes in the range of 2.0 million to 2.3 million tonnes, with prices expected to rise modestly to a range of $170 to $185 per tonne, and margins are expected to improve to the low 20% range.

In the International Distribution segment, results were generally in line with our guidance, with sales volumes expected to be in a range of 1.4 million to 1.7 million tonnes in the second quarter, while margins are expected to remain in the $20 per tonne range.

As we move forward, we anticipate an improving market environment on a gradual basis on the pricing side and a tapering off of the recent run-up in raw material costs. We also have a producer-type sharing relationship with CF for ammonia, which can result in fluctuating costs based on market conditions. However, we are commissioning a brand new ammonia vessel and tug, which is expected to be beneficial for Mosaic to arbitrage and keep down world ammonia prices for the betterment of our overall phosphate business.

Finally, we have changed our depreciation method from straight line to a unit-of-production method, resulting in a reduction in depreciation expense and a non-cash P&L benefit of approximately $70 million for 2017. We expect this change to lead to improved financial results in the near future.

Overall, with the expected improvements in margins and cost control, we anticipate meaningfully better results in the second quarter and the second half of this year. As such, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance in Mosaic based on our analysis of these key financial metrics.
