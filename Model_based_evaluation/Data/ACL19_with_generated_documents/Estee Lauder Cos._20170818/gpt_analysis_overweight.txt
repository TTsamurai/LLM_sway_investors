Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is clear that the company has demonstrated strong sales growth and profitability in fiscal year 2017. Despite economic and geopolitical volatility, the company has outperformed the industry and gained market share in global prestige beauty for the eighth consecutive year. The company's successful strategy is based on multiple engines of growth, a well-diversified business, superior talent, creativity, and unmatched product quality and branding.

Key insights and financial metrics from the conference call include:
- Sales growth of 7%, approximately 2 points ahead of global prestige beauty
- Increased exposure to fastest-growing prestige channels
- Strong growth in e-commerce, with sales growing 33%
- Strong performance in travel retail, with sales growing more than 20%
- Record growth of more than 40% in China in the fourth quarter and 90% for the year

Based on these insights and financial metrics, as a financial analyst, I recommend adopting an 'overweight' investment stance for the company. The company has a proven track record of success and is well-positioned to continue driving strong sales and profit growth in fiscal year 2018. The company's focus on innovation, digital-first mindset, and strategic distribution plans indicate promising opportunities for future growth and expansion.
