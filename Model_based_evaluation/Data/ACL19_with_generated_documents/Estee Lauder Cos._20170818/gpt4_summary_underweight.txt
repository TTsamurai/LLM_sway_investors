**Challenges and Risks:**
- **Geopolitical and Economic Instabilities:** Increased volatility might affect consumer spending and overall demand, potentially impacting future growth rates.
- **Shift in Consumer Shopping Preferences:** The accelerated shift away from traditional brick-and-mortar stores towards online platforms could undermine the company's performance in physical retail spaces, despite a strong e-commerce growth.
- **Intensifying Global Competition:** The beauty market's rapid introduction of new brands and products presents a persistent challenge in maintaining market share and consumer interest.
- **Heavy Reliance on Travel Retail and China Market:** Over-dependence on these segments may expose the company to risks associated with geopolitical tensions or shifts in tourism and travel industries.

**Strategic Outlook for Fiscal Year 2018:**
The company plans to continue leveraging its successful strategies, focusing on specialty-multi, online, travel retail, and freestanding stores to drive growth. They anticipate continued robust sales growth bolstered by effective marketing and higher consumer traffic in these channels.

**Investment Stance - Underweight:**
Given the challenges of increased global instability, shifting consumer preferences, and heightened competition, there is a potential risk to sustaining the growth momentum observed in FY 2017. The company's reliance on specific high-performing markets, particularly China and travel retail, adds a level of volatility and exposure to external shocks. Despite considerable strengths and proven strategic initiatives, these factors create uncertainty about the scalability and consistency of future earnings in a rapidly evolving market environment.

Recommendation is to adopt an 'underweight' stance on investment, due to potential vulnerabilities in the business model and market conditions that could impact profitability and growth sustainability. Investors should monitor the company's adaptability to changing retail environments and ability to maintain competitive advantage amidst growing market saturation and economic uncertainties.
