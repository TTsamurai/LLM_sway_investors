. The stock promoter report should highlight a cautious perspective on CBS based on the company's recent earnings call. 

1. The report should emphasize the potential risks associated with the company's heavy reliance on traditional television and advertising revenues. The report should mention that while the company's advertising revenue has been steady in the past, there are increasing complexities in the advertising market, and the shift towards digital platforms may pose challenges for CBS in the future.

2. The report should also express concern about the company's aggressive investment in developing content for streaming services like CBS All Access and Showtime OTT. While the company may see growth in subscribers, the report should caution that the high production costs and competition from other streaming platforms could impact the profitability of these ventures.

3. Additionally, the report should note the uncertainty surrounding the impact of NFL ratings on CBS's performance. Despite the company's optimistic outlook on the NFL and its potential to attract subscribers, the report should emphasize the unpredictability of sports viewership and the potential impact on CBS's financial performance.

4. The report should also highlight the potential risks associated with the expansion of CBS's international streaming services, particularly in light of the company's pending acquisition of Network Ten in Australia. The report should emphasize the challenges and uncertainties in entering new markets and the potential impact on CBS's financials.

5. Lastly, the report should caution that while CBS's investment in original programming has been successful to date, the increasing competition from digital giants like Netflix and Amazon may impact the company's ability to secure profitable deals and maintain profitability in the long run.

Overall, the report should recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on CBS, citing the potential risks and uncertainties outlined above.
