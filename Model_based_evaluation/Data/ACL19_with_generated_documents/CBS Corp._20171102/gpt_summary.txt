Sure, turning to the key financial metrics outlined in the conference call, here are the main points:

1. Revenue: CBS reported a 3% increase in revenue to $3.2 billion for the third quarter. This growth is driven by the company's successful content and its ability to adapt to changing consumer viewing habits.

2. Earnings Per Share (EPS): The company saw a 6% increase in EPS to $1.11, marking its 31st consecutive quarter of EPS growth. This demonstrates strong financial performance and ongoing profitability.

3. Subscription Growth: Despite industry concerns about cord cutters and declining subscribers, CBS reported growth in its traditional bundles, skinny bundles, and over-the-top services. The company's proactive approach to adapt to these changes has led to its success in retaining and growing its subscriber base.

4. Advertising Revenue: CBS highlighted the consistency of its advertising revenue, which has been strong and steady year after year. The company emphasized that advances in digital technology and analytics are making its content more valuable to advertisers, leading to increased revenue per impression.

5. Content Monetization: The company's ability to monetize its content across various platforms, including traditional and digital distribution, has been a significant driver of its financial success. CBS is taking advantage of delayed viewing and leveraging its extensive content library to sell to a variety of partners, leading to profitable deals from day one of production.

6. International Expansion: CBS is gearing up to scale its All Access service in a whole new way overseas, starting with Canada and Australia. The acquisition of Network Ten in Australia will further enhance the company's distribution capabilities and provide opportunities for growth in international markets.

Based on these financial metrics and the company's strategic initiatives, CBS appears well-positioned for continued success and growth in the evolving media landscape.
