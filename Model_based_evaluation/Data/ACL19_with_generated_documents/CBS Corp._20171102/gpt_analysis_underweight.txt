. Now that we have a good understanding of the company's recent performance and future plans, it is clear that CBS is consistently adapting to changes in the media landscape. The company is nimble in its response to viewer preferences, embracing new subscription models such as skinny bundles and over-the-top services. This is evidenced by the company's growing subscriber base and advertising revenue, which has remained steady even with the rise of cord-cutting.

One notable strength for CBS is its robust content portfolio, with a diverse range of programming across different platforms. The company's ability to capitalize on new opportunities for growth in advertising and content distribution, while also investing in premium content for its various platforms, bodes well for its future success. This is further supported by the company's expansion into international markets, leveraging its intellectual property and pending acquisition of Network Ten in Australia.

However, one aspect that warrants a cautious stance is the potential impact of the changing viewer landscape and increased competition from streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon. While the company's investments in premium content are strategic, the rising costs, as well as the potential impact on advertising and market competition, should be monitored closely.

In conclusion, while CBS has positioned itself well for growth in the evolving media landscape, the competition and rapidly changing viewer preferences present potential risks. As a result, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended until further clarity is gained on the long-term effects of these trends on the company's financial performance.
