Key Financial Metrics Analysis:

1. Identical food store sales: The company saw a positive trend in the second quarter-to-date, with positive identical food store sales and positive tonnage during the first quarter. This indicates positive growth in sales and customer demand.

2. Visits per household and loyal households growth: Visits per household remained flat, but loyal households grew by 3.2% compared to the previous year's first quarter, with positive ID sales growth. This indicates customer retention and loyalty, which is important for long-term financial performance.

3. Gross margin, operating costs, and FIFO operating profit: The company experienced a decrease in gross margin, an increase in operating costs, and a decrease in FIFO operating profit. This suggests potential challenges in maintaining profitability and controlling costs.

4. Digital revenue growth: The company saw a significant increase in digital revenue, more than doubling in the first quarter compared to the previous year. This indicates potential for growth in their digital business segment.

5. Debt ratio and free cash flow usage: The net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased, and the company used free cash flow for share repurchases, dividend payments, capital investments, and mergers. This may impact the company's financial leverage and liquidity position.

6. Guidance for fiscal 2017: The company revised its adjusted net earnings guidance range from $2.21 to $2.25 to $2.00 to $2.05, citing factors such as the challenging operating environment, deflation to inflation transition, and incremental investments in price and wages. This revision indicates potential challenges in meeting previous earnings expectations.

7. Return on invested capital (ROIC): The company reported a ROIC of 12.75% for the first quarter on a rolling four-quarter basis. This metric reflects the company's ability to generate returns from its invested capital.

Recommendation:
Based on the analysis of key financial metrics and the company's outlook, I recommend adopting an 'underweight' investment stance, taking into consideration the challenges in maintaining profitability, controlling costs, and meeting previous earnings expectations. It is important to closely monitor the company's financial performance and strategic initiatives before considering a potential investment.
