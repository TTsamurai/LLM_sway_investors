 and that could be a leverage point going forward. I think there's a lot of great things that Rodney and I both live and breathe every day, a few goals of the investments we’re doing. So again, I think we're looking at the consolidation in a favorable light for the Company. And just to be clear on the markets, the consolidation comments basically mean that as some of these smaller chains go out of business or they consolidate, then those are opportunities for a company like Kroger to come in and potentially expand its footprint in those markets. That's what we're referring to when we talk about consolidation. And as far as investments in the digital business, that's a key area of focus for us because we see the potential for significant growth in that sector. Our digital revenue more than doubled in the first quarter compared to last year, and that's a significant indicator of the potential we see in this space. The investments we are making in digital and in price will ultimately help us increase our market share over time and continue to connect with our customers in a deeper way. I think the long-term impact of these investments will be significant and will ultimately benefit the Company in terms of growth opportunities and profitability. And just to sum it up, I would like to reiterate our commitment to achieving net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11% over the long term, plus a growing dividend. We believe that the strategic investments we are making will position us well for achieving these goals. Thank you all for your time and attention today. We remain confident in Kroger’s ability to drive long-term success and we look forward to the continued progress and growth of the Company. Now, I’ll turn it back to the operator for any questions. Thank you.
