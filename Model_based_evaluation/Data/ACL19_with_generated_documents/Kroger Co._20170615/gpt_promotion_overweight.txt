Based on the recent earnings call, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Kroger Co. The company's focus on areas of highest growth, such as natural and organic products, as well as investments in digital business, have resulted in positive ID sales growth in the first quarter. Despite a decrease in gross margin and an increase in operating costs, Kroger is making deliberate and targeted investments in line with their Customer 1st Strategy. Their market share is up, and they have a substantial growth opportunity in the $1.5 trillion food market.

The company is also committed to lowering costs as a rate of sales and has used free cash flow to repurchase shares and pay dividends. Kroger's return on invested capital for the first quarter was 12.75%, evidencing strong financial performance.

While the company has lowered its guidance for net earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2017, it continues to expect flat to 1% growth in identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, and to make capital investments in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion. Kroger remains committed to achieving a net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11%, plus a growing dividend over the long term.

The company's strong focus on customer experience and brand-building, coupled with proactive pricing strategies and continual cost reduction efforts, positions Kroger Co. as a strong and resilient investment opportunity.
