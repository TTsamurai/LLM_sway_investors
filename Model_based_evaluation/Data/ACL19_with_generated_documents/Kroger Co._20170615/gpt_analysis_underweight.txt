 and have fewer products get to the shelf and then go out of the shelf in any kind of fashion. I think Rodney addressed it very well. But to the why bid up, part of it relates to the fringe rates of a price investments and a lot of that has to do with additional investments we're making to the labor for as compare investments in handling costs as we go through what appears to be a little bit of inflation over the course of the year. And as we talked about before, many of those are short-term investments to drive those all important ID sales and to work on retention of associates, so they can take care of our customers. There is a little bit of help in there on some lack of inflation, when you sometimes get hedges that cost of the commodities was used being stored or you bought them at a different time. But it's pretty short-term. Our capital guidance of $3.4 billion, I feel real good about in terms of the kind of return we’re going to get from that money and what's going to happen. I don't worry at all about the additional volume you get from a big store and now it's bigger more square footage to support the sales. I feel pretty good about those kinds of investments we're going to make. I don't think those investments are going to increase as much per foot for the buildings in maintenance and utility dollars and things like that, we think the investments we're going to make in stores are going to more than pay for themselves. For the reasons we discuss on the attraction this quarter, for being the place that we've got the highest quality product, we got the best prices, we got the best people, our stores are the best, we're going to take place in the regions and across the country we operate in. And it's going to make sense longer term that those investments should pan out. So, I feel good about where we are with the investments that we're making. And I certainly feel good about the fact that it's allowing us to move the goal post on some of these existing things that are good, better and allow us to continue to capture market share over time. Yes, I would agree that inflation is going to be on the continued higher end, we hope that’s true. But I think that's one of those where we’ve got assume, that’s true, sounding a good bit of evidence that prices are going up in commodities. I don't think it changes the model of what we’re thinking about with our investments to take market share and invest in our gross profit dollars that we get to try to manage operating costs to continue to be a lot of the pickup if not now early pickup. And I think certainty up to the point we're trying to explain to you how we want to further deepen the connection that customers have with here customers in a number of ways. And we're trying to share with you how that connection can help us not only as a retention tool, but gaining sales and gaining share against traditional competitors, but particularly if we pursue any other means in finding new alternatives and let's go use our store for them. I think my prepared comments try to address that directly when I talked about the benefits of having open relationships with our suppliers to get the best products at most fair costs. If we have a sales trend turn negative on us we pull down the sales a little bit, but trends are good. We try to get the best products to we can lift and as we do that, our suppliers are working hard to come in with the products customers want and prices customers find reasonable. And look globally consumers are looking for good prices and implacable quality products. In many cases we're seeing from the suppliers, we're seeing those products coming in from a lot of different parts of the world, and particularly from America, so feeling good about our investments in (inaudible) with American farmers and food producers, and that kind of having their products as an alternative to some exotic products that we used to be seeing. That certainly has been a part of our focus to look at the long-term fulfillment center strategy. These enhancements to our core capabilities of order to store, ship from store and and what's next day, what's same day and ship to home. So do not take too hard, we're trying to get cost of doing business in the most sites, well and shifted to the warehouse and to understand what that means for the industry. These kinds of investments have long lead times for us, and we really think that this investment we're making is going to be around for quite some time in terms of having a national footprint that turns orders around for our customers very quickly and allows us to have an omni-channel presence in the marketplace that very few people have. In terms of the customer benefits of various strategies, I would tell you that I think our customers are very happy when we have lower prices and we have higher quality goods. So I think you're seeing as the Blackboard member retired, other things being said there are a couple of thousand blue chip knockouts that the store gets over the quarter that led us to be in an environment where we want to measure our success by the amount of fans that we create. To put a number behind it is hard, to do quantify, but it is a lot 
hard to say, 'okay, we believe we're seeing some customers that were shopping after we made investments to increase our associates' engagement, the feedback from the customers was positive, our quarterly feedback was off the chart relative to what we had seen before after we increased or hours and wages. We believe we're seeing that through customers that having a better shopping experience with us and are rewarding us with more of their business. So the number is [indiscernible] but traditionally back here, but I can tell you that we're creating a lot of fans and a lot [indiscernible] with the base that furnishes [indiscernible]. And I think all those strategies are going to wind up creating more and more fans for Kroger. And this story would be something, we’re not just here, we are here by miles and miles of it 20 years from now, it is such a powerful culture that creates that kind of business that doesn't focus on some future or current reality of the day. So I hope that provides you a little bit of color and helps with your question. I’d said in our prepared remarks that I wouldn’t necessarily say that our financial reporting cadence is – we tried to give you the most up-to-date and contextual information we have to give you a good sense of what the mindset and the context going into the guidance we provided. We think the same thing is true, working on a growth environment where we try to discount. We don’t like to reduce our gross across the board. But clearly my remark we are talking about a different growth balance, where we have to be ideals the places we're going to be understanding as to how investment is labor and shrink and how we get back into the productivity loop again and the tactics that Rodney and I have talked about on gross margin and how we need to continue to manage our operating costs for the growth. These same tactics are going build and support this operating margin that grew in profitability that we really want to drive. So I’m hoping I'm taking – this is a pretty broad question about opportunities and the strategies to get back to a better operating and that's a good accomplishment. And I think we're ready with our mix that we can live with for a little while with all of the data that is suggesting we're continuing to help grow market share and connect with most. And so that integrated customer data sets and operational efficiencies that we have, I think as a last remark I had to say, I like the chance of what happens to us when from a growth margin standpoint, I was about as specific as I want to get and talked about a different and potentially healthier growth balance. Back to you, Rodney.
