As a stock promoter, I would recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on Kroger based on the company's recent earnings call. The cautious or skeptical perspective arises from several key points discussed in the call. 

Firstly, the gross margin was down, operating costs were up, and FIFO operating profit was down in the first quarter. This is not representative of the company's typical expectations, and the deliberate investments in line with the Customer 1st Strategy are impacting profitability.

Secondly, the net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased, primarily due to the merger with ModernHEALTH and the repurchase of shares. This indicates higher financial leverage for the company.

Additionally, the company lowered its guidance for fiscal 2017, citing a challenging operating environment due to transitioning from deflation to inflation. This demonstrates uncertainty about future performance.

Furthermore, the competitive and promotional environment in the grocery industry presents challenges, and the company is making strategic decisions to react to market dynamics, leading to potential margin pressures.

In conclusion, the recent earnings call raises concerns about profitability, debt levels, and competitive pressures for Kroger. These factors warrant a cautious approach to investment in the company, thus recommending an 'underweight' stance.
