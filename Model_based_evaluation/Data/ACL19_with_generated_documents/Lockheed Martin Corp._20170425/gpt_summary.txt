. Thank you all for participating in our first quarter earnings conference call. I will now provide a detailed summary report on the key financial metrics as discussed in the call.

First, it is important to note that the company had a solid quarter operationally and financially, with strong top-line growth and outstanding cash generation. Despite this, there were two earnings adjustments that negatively impacted operating profit and earnings per share. The adjustments were related to an international C4I contract and a non-cash impairment charge related to an international joint venture.

On the positive side, the company had strong cash from operations in the quarter and increased the outlook for the year. Additionally, the company returned over $1 billion to stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. The company also achieved an overall economic agreement for F-35 LRIPs 9 through 11, which resulted in improved cash payment terms.

In terms of operational highlights, the company highlighted notable achievements in its Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control, and Rotary and Mission Systems business areas. These included the successful participation of the F-35A in the premier air combat exercise, Red Flag, the selection of the long range anti-ship missile, LRASM, as the Aviation Week Laureate Award winner, and the affirmative Milestone C decision for the Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion heavy lift helicopter.

In terms of financial performance, the company discussed opportunities in both domestic and international markets. It highlighted the significant ramp-up in production for the F-35 program and mentioned strong demand for missile defense systems, including Aegis, PAC-3, THAAD, and MEADS. The company also mentioned opportunities in the aircraft market, particularly for the F-16, as well as upcoming bids for programs such as T-X, JSTARS, Future Vertical Lift, and Ground Based Strategic Deterrent.

Additionally, the company provided updates on its facilities, including the decision to move the F-16 final assembly and check-out facility to Greenville and the expectation of delivering F-16s to Bahrain from Greenville. The company also discussed the Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) for the F-16 and the non-cash impairment charge related to the international joint venture.

Overall, the company emphasized its commitment to growth, cash generation, and providing world-class solutions to customers while creating long-term value for stockholders. The company expressed optimism about future opportunities and invited participants to the next earnings call in July.

This summary report provides a comprehensive overview of the recent earnings conference call, focusing on key financial metrics and operational highlights for the company. Thank you for your attention.
