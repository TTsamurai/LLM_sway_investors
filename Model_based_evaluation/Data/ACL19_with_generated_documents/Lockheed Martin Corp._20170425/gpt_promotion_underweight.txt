Based on the earnings call, there are several key factors that indicate a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company's performance. The first factor is the negative impact on operating profit and EPS due to two earnings adjustments, including a non-cash impairment charge related to an international joint venture and a charge associated with an international C4I contract. These adjustments resulted in lower than anticipated earnings per share.

Furthermore, the continuing resolution that limits government spending and prohibits new programs from starting could have longer-term consequences for the company's business. The uncertainty surrounding the approval of the FY 2017 Defense Appropriations Act and the impact of lower oil prices on the company's international joint venture also contribute to a cautious outlook.

In terms of future opportunities, while the company expresses optimism about potential contracts and international sales, it is important to note that these opportunities are not guaranteed and may not materialize as expected.

Lastly, the decision to move the assembly line for the F-16 to Greenville and the potential order from Bahrain are positive developments, but the timing and actual impact on the company's financial performance remain uncertain.

Overall, considering the impact of earnings adjustments, uncertain government spending, and potential international sales, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company at this time. Further monitoring of the company's performance and developments in government spending and international contracts is advisable before considering a more bullish investment stance.
