Based on the company's recent earnings call, the company has demonstrated strong execution performance and took proactive steps to manage through the weak oil price environment by significantly reducing capital spend and operating costs while continuing to progress future growth options. The company expects production to increase in the second half of 2017, with a forecasted production growth rate of over 10% from the first to the fourth quarter. The Bakken continues to deliver outstanding results, and the company plans to increase its rig count from two to six rigs by the end of the year. The company also plans to drill approximately 80 wells and bring approximately 75 new wells online in 2017, focusing on the core of their Bakken acreage. In addition, the company is conducting completion design pilots to optimize value in the core of the core and is continuously working on enhancing their completion techniques. The company anticipates that its North Malay Basin and Stampede developments will generate significant cash flow once fully operational. Moreover, the company is actively engaged in exploration and appraisal drilling activity in Guyana to evaluate the wider resource potential of the Stabroek block. The company expects to continue to balance its investment in growth and free cash flow generation, with 2018 being a significant transition year as it starts generating free cash flow from North Malay Basin and Stampede to fund future development projects like Liza and other growth projects in Bakken.

Based on the positive outlook for production growth, strong execution performance, cost management, and future growth prospects, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company.
