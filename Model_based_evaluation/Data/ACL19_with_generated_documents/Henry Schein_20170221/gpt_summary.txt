 the patterns in February. As for the operating margin expansion, our guidance assumes that we will be able to maintain or possibly improve the margin given the measures we have in place to drive cost efficiencies and improve productivity. In regards to the impact of the extra week on sales growth, we have provided separate estimates to allow for more meaningful comparisons, as mentioned earlier. And we do expect continued margin expansion going forward. Thank you for your time and attention to these key financial metrics. We look forward to discussing these results in more detail in our upcoming meetings and calls.
