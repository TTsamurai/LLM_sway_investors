Based on the earnings call transcript, it is clear that the company is facing significant challenges. The restructuring costs from 2015 and 2016 have had a negative impact on the company's financial performance. The operating margin has contracted, and there are uncertainties related to the effective tax rate for 2017. Additionally, foreign exchange has been a headwind for the company's financials, and the unpredictability of foreign exchange rates adds to the uncertainty.

The sales growth in the Dental and Animal Health segments is attributed to an extra selling week in the fourth quarter of 2016, which may have inflated the results. The company also experienced lumpy sales in the dental equipment segment, which may continue in the first quarter of 2017.

The guidance for 2017 assumes only a modest improvement in end market conditions, indicating that the company is not expecting significant growth in the near future.

In light of these factors, it is recommended to take a cautious or skeptical stance on the company and maintain an "underweight" investment stance. The challenges outlined in the earnings call transcript suggest that the company may continue to face financial difficulties in the near term. It is important to carefully monitor the company's performance and reassess the investment stance based on future developments.
