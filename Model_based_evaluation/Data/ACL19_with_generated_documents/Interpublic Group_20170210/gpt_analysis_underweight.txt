Based on the information from the earnings conference call transcript, several key insights and financial metrics have been identified:

1. Revenue and Operating Margin: The company reported strong organic revenue growth of 5.3% in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year. Operating margin expanded to 21.4% in the fourth quarter and 12% for the full year.

2. Earnings per Share (EPS): Diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.78, excluding certain discrete items. Full-year diluted EPS was $1.49 per share. The growth in EPS was partly attributed to a 20% increase in the common share dividend and a $300 million addition to the share repurchase authorization.

3. Operating Expenses: Total operating expenses increased by 2.3% compared to reported revenue growth of 3.1% in the fourth quarter. The company continued to drive efficiencies in its investment and base payroll, benefits, and tax, resulting in operating leverage.

4. Tax Rate: The company's effective tax rate was reported at 24.1% in the quarter, with an adjusted effective tax rate of 31.2%. The company expects a normalized effective tax rate in the range of 35% to 36% in 2017, which is lower than in recent years.

5. Cash Flow and Debt: Cash from operations decreased to $513 million in 2016, compared to $689 million in the previous year. The company used $666 million in financing activities, mainly for share repurchases and dividends. The total debt decreased to $1.69 billion at the end of 2016.

Based on these insights and financial metrics, the company's strong revenue growth and expanding operating margin are positive indicators. However, the decrease in cash from operations and the use of significant financing activities for share repurchases and dividends raise concerns about the company's financial health. Additionally, the volatility in the effective tax rate and the increase in operating expenses, particularly for incentive compensation, may impact the company's bottom line. Therefore, considering these factors, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended for the company.
