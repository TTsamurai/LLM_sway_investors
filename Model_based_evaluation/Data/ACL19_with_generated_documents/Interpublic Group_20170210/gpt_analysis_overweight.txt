Based on the insights and financial metrics from the recent earnings conference call transcript, the company's performance is strong and shows positive growth across all regions. The fourth quarter organic growth was 5.3%, U.S. organic growth was 3.3%, and international organic growth was 7.8%. For the full year, organic growth was 5% and all regions increased organically.

The operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 12% for the full year, and operating profit increased 8%. The company repurchased 13 million shares for $303 million during the year and increased the common share dividend by 20% to $0.18 per share quarterly.

The company has demonstrated strong expense discipline while achieving strong revenue growth. Total operating expenses increased 2.3% compared with reported revenue growth of 3.1% in the fourth quarter, and for the full year, operating expenses grew 2.5% supporting revenue growth of 3.1%.

The company's long-term goal is to achieve a 50 basis point margin for 2017, and they are focused on gaining incremental efficiency in their cost structure while remaining disciplined around their largest cost, which is related to their people.

Based on the strong performance and positive outlook provided in the conference call, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance for the company. With sustained and significant gains in operating margin, strong revenue growth, and a focus on cost efficiency and discipline, the company is well positioned for future growth and value creation.
