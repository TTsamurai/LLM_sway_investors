Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, the company reported positive growth in organic revenue for the fourth quarter and full year, with operating margin expansion. However, there are several key financial metrics that warrant an 'underweight' investment stance.

First, the company's effective tax rate is volatile, with an adjusted rate of 31.2% in the fourth quarter and 33.4% for the full year. Additionally, the normalized effective tax rate for 2017 is projected to be in the range of 35% to 36%, which is higher than the current rate. This indicates potential challenges in tax management and could impact future profitability.

Second, while the company achieved strong revenue growth, there was a decrease in pass-through revenue, which affected organic growth by 20 basis points in the full year. This suggests potential challenges in revenue generation and could impact future earnings.

Third, the company's operating expenses increased 2.3% in the fourth quarter compared to reported revenue growth of 3.1%. The ratio of total salaries and related expenses to revenue also increased to 64.2% for the full year. This indicates potential challenges in cost management and could impact future profitability.

Additionally, the company experienced a decrease in cash and short-term marketable securities, and a net decrease of $409 million in cash and marketable securities for the full year. This suggests potential liquidity concerns and could impact the company's financial stability.

Overall, the aforementioned financial metrics point to potential challenges in tax management, revenue generation, cost control, and liquidity. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended for the company based on these key financial indicators.
