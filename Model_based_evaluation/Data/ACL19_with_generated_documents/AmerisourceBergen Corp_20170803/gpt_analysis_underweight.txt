As a financial analyst, the outlook report for the company would be as follows:

Based on the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that the company has shown some positive results in the third quarter, with an increase in adjusted diluted EPS and solid unit volume growth across several businesses. However, there are several headwinds that need to be considered in the future outlook.

The company's Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment has experienced challenges in operating income, with a decline in gross profit and lower brand inflation contributing to a decrease in segment operating income. Additionally, lower throughput or shipments in the PharMEDium business has had an impact on overall operating income.

In terms of revenue, the company is revising its full-year growth rate to approximately 5%, with lower revenue growth contributing to relatively flat operating income dollar growth. The company also anticipates a higher overall tax rate and a potential mismatch of new DC operating expenses with associated incremental revenues in fiscal 2018.

Although the company expects to continue to grow in the healthcare environment, it is important to consider the potential impact of headwinds such as pricing, operating expenses, and taxes in the future outlook. The company is also working through a new organizational structure and evaluating possible investments in IT systems, which may result in short-term headwinds.

Therefore, based on the information provided, adopting an 'underweight' investment stance for the company in the future outlook would be prudent, considering the potential impact of headwinds on the company's financial performance in fiscal 2018.
