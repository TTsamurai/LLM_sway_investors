. We really can't say specifically what the impact on the expenses would be until we complete the business planning process. However, we do anticipate an increase in operating expenses in fiscal 2018, particularly due to the strategic phasing of the opening of new distribution centers throughout the year. This will result in a considerable higher operating expense growth rate. Additionally, we are evaluating possible investments in IT systems, which may yield long-term organizational benefits and efficiencies, but would result in short-term headwinds. While we will be diligent in managing our operating expenses, we do anticipate higher growth rates in fiscal 2018. This is something we are mindful of and will continue to monitor as we work through our planning process. Thank you.
