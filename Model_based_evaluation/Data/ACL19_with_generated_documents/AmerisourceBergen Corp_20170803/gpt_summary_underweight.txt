 so I just wanted to flag that we don't see that as a headwind. As for the impact of the tax rate, we do anticipate an increase in our overall tax rate for fiscal 2018 due to the expected slowing of favorable tax benefits from employee option exercises and the lap of certain one-time discrete tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2017. Additionally, any significant new U.S. business acquisitions, such as Walgreens' pending acquisition of the Rite Aid pharmacies, would change the mix of our pre-tax income and increase our overall tax rate. 
In summary, our financial analysis of the recent earnings conference call transcript reveals several key financial metrics that suggest an underweight investment stance. The decline in operating income, negative free cash flow, and lower expected tax benefits are areas of concern. While the company is optimistic about growing its business in the coming year, the uncertainty surrounding the impact of headwinds such as brand and generic pricing, operating expenses, and taxes suggests caution in investment decisions. These key financial metrics point towards a challenging fiscal year 2018, warranting an underweight investment stance.
