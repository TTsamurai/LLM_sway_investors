 on the potential impact on sales, but we continue to be optimistic about the opportunity for KEYTRUDA in lung cancer. However, it's important to note that while KEYTRUDA sales are strong, there are still challenges in the global human health division. The decline in sales for JANUVIA franchise and the expected pressure on ZEPATIER indicate potential for underperformance in these areas. Additionally, the pricing pressure on JANUVIA and the competitive landscape for ZEPATIER suggest potential challenges for these products in the near future. While the growth in oncology and Vaccine businesses is promising, it may not be enough to offset the potential underperformance in other areas. Therefore, based on the cautious outlook for certain products within the company's portfolio, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company.
