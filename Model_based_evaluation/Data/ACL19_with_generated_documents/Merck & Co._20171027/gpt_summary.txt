 on the potential for the combination of KEYTRUDA and chemotherapy in lung cancer. We're very happy with the progress to date. The increase in the amount of testing has resulted in increased sales as we've gotten the PD-L1 testing up. And as each country reimburses, we see good uptake. So we're feeling very good about what we're doing in lung cancer and also looking at other tumor types. In Japan, we've seen some initial uptake as well. We've been very pleased with our launch in Japan. And we're excited about the opportunity there. Overall, we're very pleased with the performance of KEYTRUDA and the potential for growth in lung cancer and other tumor types.
