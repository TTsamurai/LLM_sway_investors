 firmly on the uptake in lung cancer, but we continue to be optimistic about the potential for growth in this area.

Based on the information provided in the conference call transcript, it is evident that Merck has several key products that are performing well and have the potential for continued growth. The standout product in this regard is KEYTRUDA, which exceeded $1 billion in sales for the first time and is now the second-largest product in the Merck portfolio. The product has seen strong growth in the U.S. and has a significant presence in various tumor types, making it the most prescribed treatment for new metastatic lung cancer patients. Merck is also seeing strong performance from LYNPARZA and other products in its portfolio.

Furthermore, the company's Vaccine business has shown growth outside of the U.S., with strong demand for GARDASIL offsetting the negative impact of the transition to a two-dose regimen in the U.S. The success of BRIDION in various markets around the world also bodes well for the company's Hospital and Specialty segment.

Despite some challenges, such as pricing pressure for the JANUVIA franchise and expected pressure on ZEPATIER, the overall performance of Merck's products is impressive. The company's focus on establishing KEYTRUDA as a foundation for the treatment of cancer and its efforts in educating physicians about the product's potential in different patient types indicate a strong growth strategy.

In conclusion, based on the information provided in the conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for Merck. The company's strong portfolio of products, with a focus on oncology and vaccines, as well as its global presence, position it well for continued success and growth in the future.
