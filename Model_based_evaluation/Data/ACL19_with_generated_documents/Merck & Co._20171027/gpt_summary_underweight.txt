 on the uptake in Japan, but so far, we're pleased with the progress. We continue to address the evolving landscape and competitive environment and remain optimistic about the potential opportunities for KEYTRUDA globally. As we look ahead, we are confident in our ability to drive continued growth in our key franchises, particularly in oncology and vaccines, and believe we are well positioned for success in the coming year. Thank you. 

Recommendation:
Based on the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, I recommend adopting an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. Despite the strong performance of KEYTRUDA and other key franchises, the decline in sales for JANUVIA and the anticipated pressure on ZEPATIER indicate potential challenges for sustained growth. Additionally, the continued pricing pressure and evolving competitive landscape present risk factors for the company's financial performance. Therefore, it is prudent to approach investments in the company with caution and an underweight position. Further analysis of the company's financial metrics and market conditions is recommended to make informed investment decisions.
