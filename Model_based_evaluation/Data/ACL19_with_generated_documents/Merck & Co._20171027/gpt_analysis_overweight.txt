on specific market milestones, but overall, we're very pleased with the progress we're making in lung cancer globally.

Based on the insights from the recent earnings conference call transcript, the company's performance in the third quarter of the fiscal year demonstrates a strong focus on oncology, particularly with the success of KEYTRUDA. The company reported strong sales for KEYTRUDA, exceeding $1 billion for the first time, making it the second-largest product in the company's portfolio. Additionally, the company highlighted its growing leadership position in lung cancer, with nearly one in three new lung cancer patients in the U.S. being started on KEYTRUDA. The sales in the U.S. grew to just over $600 million in the quarter, indicating strong demand for the product.

The company's focus on global expansion of KEYTRUDA is evident, with continued efforts to establish the drug as a foundation for the treatment of cancer. The sales growth and market leadership in melanoma, head and neck cancer, and bladder cancer further reinforce the potential for KEYTRUDA in various indications. The company's collaboration with AstraZeneca for LYNPARZA also presents growth opportunities in the ovarian and metastatic breast cancer markets.

In addition to oncology, the company's vaccine business showed growth outside of the U.S., particularly with the strength of GARDASIL. The company expressed confidence in continuous supply in the U.S. and sees opportunities for further growth in the vaccine business.

The financial metrics derived from the transcript indicate certain declines in sales for products like JANUVIA and ZEPATIER, as well as continued pricing pressure in the diabetes franchise. However, the company remains optimistic about volume growth, especially outside of the U.S., and views the diabetes franchise as a relatively stable foundation for future growth.

Based on these key insights and financial metrics, an 'overweight' investment stance can be adopted for the company. The strong performance of KEYTRUDA and the company's global expansion efforts in oncology present significant growth opportunities. Additionally, the strength of the vaccine business and the potential for volume growth in the diabetes franchise provide further support for an overweight investment stance. Overall, the company's focus on innovation, market leadership, and global expansion positions it well for success heading into the future.
