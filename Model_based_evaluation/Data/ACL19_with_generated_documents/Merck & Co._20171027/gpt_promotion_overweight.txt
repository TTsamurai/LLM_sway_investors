on the potential impact in the first-line setting. But we're encouraged by the early data that we're seeing. Additionally, with regards to LYNPARZA, we are excited about the potential in both ovarian and metastatic breast cancer. Our co-marketing efforts with AstraZeneca are ramping up, and we expect to see continued growth in this area.

Based on the strong performance of our oncology franchise, particularly KEYTRUDA and LYNPARZA, and the continued growth opportunities in our Vaccine and Hospital and Specialty businesses, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Merck. The strong sales of KEYTRUDA, particularly the significant uptake in lung cancer, as well as the potential in other indications, position Merck as a global leader in immuno-oncology. Furthermore, the growth opportunities for LYNPARZA in ovarian and metastatic breast cancer, in addition to the strength of our Vaccine business, support this investment stance. We believe that these factors set Merck up for success heading into the next year. Thank you.
