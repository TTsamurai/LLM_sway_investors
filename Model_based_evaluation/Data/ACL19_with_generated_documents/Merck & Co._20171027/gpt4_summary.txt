**Summary Report: Earnings Conference Call**

**Company:** Global Human Health
**Quarter:** Third Quarter

**Key Financial Metrics and Performance Highlights:**

1. **Sales Performance**:
   - Total sales amounted to $9.2 billion, marking a decline of 4% year-over-year. This was primarily attributed to the loss of exclusivity for several products.
   - Despite overall decline, strong underlying growth was noted in recently launched products including KEYTRUDA, ZEPATIER, and BRIDION.

2. **Product-specific Sales and Developments**:
   - **KEYTRUDA**: Sales exceeded $1 billion for the first time, making it the second-largest product in the portfolio. During 2017, six new indications were launched in the U.S., four in Europe, and three in Japan. KEYTRUDA now leads in treatment initiation among immuno-oncology agents across all indications. U.S. sales for KEYTRUDA alone reached just over $600 million in the quarter.
     - **Lung Cancer**: Nearly one-third of new U.S. lung cancer patients started on KEYTRUDA. 
     - **Bladder Cancer**: Achieved leadership in new Rx share within just two months in the second line or greater setting.
     - **Other Regions**: Continues to hold leadership in PD-1 class for melanoma outside of the U.S. with strong initial performance in Japan and recent approval in Europe for bladder cancer.
   
   - **LYNPARZA**: Co-marketed globally with AstraZeneca, focusing on ovarian and upcoming metastatic breast cancer opportunities.

   - **JANUVIA Franchise**: Reported sales of $1.5 billion, down by 2%, influenced by continued pricing pressures but offset by volume growth mainly outside the U.S.

3. **Vaccine Business**:
   - Global sales totaled $1.9 billion. GARDASIL sales remained strong, managing to offset impacts from the transition to a two-dose regimen in the U.S.

4. **Hospital and Specialty**:
   - **ZEPATIER**: Noted growth in Europe, Japan, and the U.S., although facing significant competitive pressures.
   - **BRIDION**: Achieved over 30% growth, driven by strong demand and a high repurchase rate of nearly 95% in top U.S. accounts.

5. **Strategic Focus and Outlook for 2018**:
   - The company will continue to focus on strengthening and expanding the use of KEYTRUDA across various indications, including lung cancer both in high expressers and in combination with ALIMTA for lower expressers.
   - The upcoming focus will be on education around NON-expressers or non-PD-L1 tested patients for potential growth.
   - Expansion in vaccine segment with continuous strength expected from GARDASIL.
   - Ongoing efforts in securing reimbursements, particularly for lung cancer treatments in the EU.

**Conclusion**:
Despite a decline due to loss of exclusivity for several products, the company has maintained robust growth from key products like KEYTRUDA, which now dominates in multiple cancer indications. The focus remains strong on oncology and vaccine segments, with strategic co-marketing initiatives and expanded indications set to drive future growth. The company is poised to tackle pricing pressures and competitive market conditions heading into 2018, with confidence in continuous supply and sustained demand for its leading products.
