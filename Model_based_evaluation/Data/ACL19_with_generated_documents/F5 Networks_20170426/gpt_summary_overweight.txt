Summary:

The company is reporting Q2 earnings of revenue of $518.2 million, reflecting a year-over-year revenue growth of 7%. The growth is from sales strength in the U.S., including strong enterprise and service provider sales, offset by continued weakness in EMEA and lower-than-expected services revenue. Product revenue growth accelerated to 7% year-over-year in the quarter, up from 2% in the prior quarter. GAAP EPS was $1.43 per share, while non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.95.

The company emphasizes the continued adoption of iSeries products, accelerating sales of software solutions, and the company's growth in cloud environments. They recognize that continued uncertainty in EMEA merits prudence. The company's competitive landscape has not changed and they feel strong in terms of competition.

The company anticipates the software becoming more prominent in their business, leading to a higher gross margin. However, they are balancing their trade-off of investment against higher gross margin. They are looking to push the top line and focus on execution to ensure growth. The company will evaluate the opportunity to reinvest the gross margin back in the business on a quarterly basis.

The company experienced an impact from end-of-life products, and the impact was bigger than anticipated. They expect to start growing sequentially again in the following quarter. The company also expects to see growth from surrounding discussions due to the strong deferred revenue. They are resetting after seeing flat growth in the quarter, and expect to start growing sequentially again.

Overall, the company aims to drive top-line growth and remain focused on execution and investment in order to sustain growth.
