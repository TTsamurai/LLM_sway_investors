, as that has been fairly consistent, especially the areas of strength you mentioned. Our IoT win – specifically, and then, the significant increase in U.S. service providers that we talked about. We had security products represented a larger mix of the products sold. So we definitely see investment there required. If the new software products – and I think the container orchestrator would really be a prime example and then – and specifically there might be things that give us leverage as we go to market. It's very important to us that we continue to invest there, and it's necessary to drive the longer-term growth. And I've said in prior times, and I believe we said it on the October call, that's been an area of strong focus for us as a company. So I think the cloud pieces you brought up specifically, just make sense for us. And then, as we layer in the security, we think we have the leverage points in place.. So in general, we're investing broadly across the business. It just starts with the sales organization not necessarily rebuilding more in sales. We're backfilling holes, which can come from a lot of places and not necessarily blowing up sales headcount. This is a very competitive industry. So we want to be positioned correctly in a number of diversified spaces to take advantage of the evolving market. Yeah. That's accurate, François, and that's a good question. The base assumption under the guidance is not a big sequential jump from Americas to EMEA. So in general, what are we implying, John? I think we're implying that we're working through the sales force, the pipeline. We think EMEA is important to our growth, but we're being conservative because we think it's the right thing to do. And historically speaking, EMEA in Q3 has been a seasonally weaker spot. So that plays into the mix as well. Given where we're guiding, that's where we feel we need to be. And it's not so much a comment for EMEA. François, we don't go to those levels of detail across the company. We just don't. But then, why have we highlighted EMEA in the guide, John? Or maybe tied to the question, what is the revenue build, as you called it, and why did we highlight EMEA as an area of concern? And maybe talk through why we're pricing the guide the way we are. Last quarter, we highlighted EMEA as a business driver we wanted to see turning. I said on that call some things have been worked on. It hasn't played out exactly how we thought it would. There's misreading there, specifically on the services drag continuing to fall. So all is not good in EMEA, and then added the fact that we're seeing headwinds in services. So we're still in the midst of resetting with the magnitude and the timing. It's just something that we need to manage and we think that's sensitive enough is why it's attached to the guide. And generally, it maybe factors more than we zero in on. So given that everything we talked about, the base premise of our guide has factors around EMEA and those set pricing is about where we would end up.

Given the past quarterly results, it can be observed that F5 delivered a revenue of $518.2 million in fiscal Q2, reflecting year-over-year revenue growth of 7%. A majority of this growth came from sales strength in the U.S., highlighted by strong enterprise and service provider sales, offset by continued weakness in EMEA and lower-than-expected services revenue.

Key insights that can be derived from the conference call as it pertains to the company's future outlook include:
1. Revenue from the Americas accounted for 56% of total revenue during the quarter, highlighting strong growth.
2. Service revenue grew 7% year-over-year and represented 53% of total revenue.
3. Enterprise customers represented 65% of total sales during the quarter.
4. A year-over-year growth of 16% was seen with APAC contributing 15% of revenue.
5. A net increase of 55 employees from the prior quarter was reported, showcasing a slight rise in headcount.
6. Cash flow from operations was reported as $175.3 million in Q2.
7. A revenue target for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was set at $520 million to $530 million, anticipating modest growth from Q2.
8. GAAP gross margin was reported at 83% in Q2, with non-GAAP gross margin at 84.6%.
9. The introduction of new products and functionality aimed at extending opportunities across various cloud infrastructures was mentioned, including support for BIG-IP in the Google public cloud and new technologies enabling microservice environments.
10. New products and functionality are expected to facilitate continued product revenue growth, with a focus on accelerating sales of software solutions. However, prudence is recommended due to the ongoing uncertainty in EMEA.

Based on the financial metrics and insights derived from the recent earnings conference call, an 'underweight' investment stance would be adopted due to the company's concerns regarding operational performance in EMEA, the lower-than-expected services revenue, and the need to manage ongoing uncertainties. An 'underweight' investment stance typically indicates an expectation that the stock will underperform compared to the industry average or particular benchmark. This stance reflects the apprehension about the company's ability to meet its financial targets and drive business growth in the near term. Therefore, it is advisable to approach investment decisions cautiously and closely monitor the company's operational performance and outlook.
