 in the report, but we thought it was important for investors to be aware of these key highlights and the cautious stance we are taking. We believe that F5 is facing several challenges, including continued weakness in the EMEA region and lower-than-expected services revenue. We think that these challenges, combined with ongoing uncertainties, merit prudence as we approach our outlook for Q3. Furthermore, despite the strong product revenue growth, there are concerns regarding the length of time it will take for newly introduced products to have a significant impact on overall performance. Additionally, we believe that the company's ongoing investment in head count may impact profitability, particularly in the short term. 

In conclusion, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on F5 Networks based on the factors discussed in the recent earnings call, and advise cautiousness when considering the company for investment.
