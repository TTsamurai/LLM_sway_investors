in the guidance. But I think, going back to my earlier comment on strength of revenue, we think we're going to be back to a higher growth rate going forward, as we've done in the past. So that's something we highlighted. And we'll revisit that if we provide October guidance or not, when I'm actually not sure at the moment. But we'll get back to you if that does come up. Yeah. The short answer is, nothing obviously has changed to that disbelief. We're fortunate enough to talk to our sales team frequently and strive to understand what they're seeing, and we understand what they're seeing. And we've had good feedback on what they're seeing. So no, we still believe that. As it relates to the mix of business, really â€“ nothing really has changed there. I think we're seeing what we talked about on the last call. No real change. Okay. So on the rate of feed for deals I think we get that feedback through our sales team. And as I'd mentioned, we were seeing growth to the largest size and the strongest driver. We didn't qualify the international markets now versus before, as it related to the international coverage on services. And we highlighted, particularly around EMEA, that the end of life products did have a really strong impact on our services numbers. And I think that's probably the right way to look at it. Nothing is necessarily new, but I think to highlight it from our perspective, the invitations from there and specifically on the subject of our services it had an impact.
