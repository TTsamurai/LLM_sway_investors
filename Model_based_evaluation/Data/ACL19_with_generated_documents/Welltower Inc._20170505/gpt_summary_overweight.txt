Dear colleagues,

I have prepared a detailed summary report on the recent earnings conference call transcript of our company. In summary, the key financial metrics point towards a positive outlook, with growth rates in same-store NOI indicating stable and reliable performance. The senior housing segment, especially triple net and long-term post-acute portfolios, grew 3.2% and 3.4% respectively. The outpatient medical portfolio also saw a healthy 2.4% growth.

Despite a decline in occupancy due to a flu season, revenue increased by 2.3% on a leap year adjusted basis. Strong pricing power and operating expenses, which increased 3% adjusting for the leap year, have also shown promising trends. Specifically, labor expenses have moderated from recent highs and are expected to further moderate in the UK. Overall, senior housing demand supply remains largely healthy, with only pockets of imbalance due to heightened deliveries in certain markets.

The report also highlights that while debt due to flu was almost four times higher than last year, it is much lower than 2015. This is attributed to the preparedness of quality operators to deal with a bad flu season. In markets where admissions bans were implemented to protect resident populations, there was a decline in occupancy. However, this is expected to benefit the rest of the year's results as these measures have helped to build a base for growth.

Regarding expenses, the company emphasized that roughly half of the expenses are fixed and half are floating. Only floating expenses, such as labor costs and food, would be impacted. On the revenue side, it is only impacted for operators that charge on a per DM basis. The company reassured that it remains excited about the year and the prospect of its operating performance.

In conclusion, the company believes that its sustained rate growth in the face of new supply exhibits not only the quality of real estate it owns, but also the value proposition senior living provides for its growing need-based resident population. The company expressed confidence in its assets class and offered a unique opportunity to medium and long-term investors. Overall, the report presents a positive outlook for the company's performance and future growth potential.

Based on this analysis and the financial metrics presented in the conference call, I recommend adopting an 'overweight' investment stance on our company. The positive trends in same-store NOI, revenue growth, and operating expenses, coupled with the company's strategic capital allocation decisions, indicate promising opportunities for long-term investors.

Sincerely,
