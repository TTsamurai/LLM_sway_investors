Good afternoon shareholders, we are pleased to report strong double-digit global revenue growth in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. Our success is attributed to the sales from Software-as-a-Service businesses and the launch of our new ResMed AirMini, the world's smallest CPAP. The AirMini provides amazing, compact, quiet, therapeutic comfort to patients and opens up new channels of cash payment for our homecare provider customers. Furthermore, we have seen solid growth in our range of AirFit masks and have ramped up manufacturing to meet demand. Our non-GAAP net operating profit grew at 13% on a year-on-year basis and our diluted EPS was $0.71 on a non-GAAP basis.

In the Americas region, we achieved double-digit revenue growth, driven by SaaS revenue from Brightree and solid growth in masks. The mask and accessories category grew 8% in the quarter, reflecting strong demand for our new N20 and F20 products. Our connected care and digital health solutions are also contributing to our success, with over 3 million patients monitored with 100% cloud-connected medical devices in their homes.

In the combined EMEA and APAC regions, mask and accessories sales were up 12% this quarter, driven by the launch of our N20 and F20 products. We achieved solid growth in our AirSense 10 range of devices, as well as our non-invasive ventilators in Europe and Asia.

Our 2020 Growth Strategy focuses on our core sleep apnea business, connected care in COPD, and other areas such as sleep health and wellness and chronic disease management. Our recent study showed that switching patients with treatment-emergent central sleep apnea to ResMed's Adaptive-Servo Ventilation technology significantly improves adherence, indicating the potential for future growth in this area.

We are optimistic about the opportunities for growth in the U.S. market with the launch of the ResMed AirMini and continued focus on driving awareness of sleep apnea and COPD. Additionally, our connected care strategy in COPD and the potential for growth in the travel CPAP niche are promising avenues for future growth.

Overall, we are excited about the future innovations and strategies for connected care and digital health and remain committed to improving the lives of millions of patients. Thank you for your continued support. We look forward to the future and the ongoing growth of ResMed. Thank you.
