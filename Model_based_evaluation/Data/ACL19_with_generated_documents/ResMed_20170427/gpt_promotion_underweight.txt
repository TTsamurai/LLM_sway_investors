, who will open up the call for Q&A. Thank you.

Summary: The company has experienced strong revenue growth, particularly in the Americas region, driven by software-as-a-service revenue and the launch of new mask products. The company's non-GAAP net operating profit and diluted EPS have also shown growth. The company has successfully launched the world's smallest CPAP, the ResMed AirMini, and is seeing strong demand for its new range of mask products. Additionally, the company is making significant advances in its connected care strategy for COPD and is pioneering digital health solutions. The company is also focused on growth opportunities in sleep health and wellness, chronic disease management, and clinical adjacencies. It is important to note that the company's supply has been backordered for some SKUs, but the company expects to catch up with and get ahead of demand in the current quarter. Furthermore, the company is cautious about predicting future product launches and is considering tax relief opportunities for reinvesting funds in the U.S. The company is also focused on maintaining and growing its market share, particularly in the U.S., and is optimistic about the growth potential of its newly launched products and initiatives.
