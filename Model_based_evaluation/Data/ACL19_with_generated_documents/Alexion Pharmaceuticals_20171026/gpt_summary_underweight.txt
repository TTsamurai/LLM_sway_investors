 Based on the earnings conference call transcript, I would adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. Here's why:

1. Revenue Growth: The reported revenue growth of 8% year-over-year is lower than previous quarters due to multiple headwinds such as timing of orders, impact from clinical trial enrollments, and pricing headwinds.

2. Soliris Revenue Impact: The impact of ALXN1210 and other trials on Soliris is expected to result in limited incremental headwinds to revenue for both 2017 and 2018.

3. Operating Expenses: Operating expenses are expected to increase due to seasonal medical congresses, timing of clinical drug batches, and restructuring expenses.

4. Effective Tax Rate: The effective tax rate is expected to increase in 2018, which will impact non-GAAP earnings per share.

5. Business Development: The company's business development efforts are still in the early stages, with a new team being formed to focus on building a pipeline of assets.

6. Revenue Expectations: Although revenue guidance has been increased, the impact of ALXN1210 trials and the ramp of enrollment through 2017 may result in limited contribution from certain products, such as MG, in the near term.

Overall, the company's revenue growth is expected to face headwinds in the near term, and there are uncertainties around the impact of ongoing trials and the effectiveness of business development efforts. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended.
