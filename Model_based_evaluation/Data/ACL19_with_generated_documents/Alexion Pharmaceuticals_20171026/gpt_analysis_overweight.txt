3. Operating Margin: The company delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 45%, benefiting from revenue growth and focus on operating expenses. Additionally, the effective tax rate in the quarter was 10%, contributing to non-GAAP earnings per share.

4. Cash Flow and Balance Sheet: In the quarter, the company generated over $580 million in free cash flow and ended September 30 with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. This strong financial position provides stability and potential for future investments.

5. Guidance for 2018: The company has revised its full-year guidance, expecting total revenues between $3.475 billion to $3.525 billion, representing approximately 13% total revenue growth year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance has also been increased to $5.50 to $5.65, indicating approximately 21% growth at the mid-point of the range.

6. Pipeline and Business Development: The company aims to achieve double-digit revenue growth and increase operating margin to 50% in 2019. It is focused on pipeline development and disciplined business development, as evidenced by the appointment of a new Senior Vice President of Business Development and Corporate Strategy.
