The company reported total revenues of $859 million in the third quarter, representing an 8% year-over-year growth. The non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.44 also grew a strong 17% year-over-year. Product sales were driven by growth in the U.S., Europe, and the Asia Pacific region, with a 9% increase in volume, offset by FX and pricing headwinds. Soliris revenue was $756 million, with year-over-year volume growth of 3% and underlying volume growth around 13% when adjusting for ALXN1210 and ordering patterns. Strensiq revenue was $87 million and Kanuma achieved revenues of $16 million.

The company delivered a non-GAAP operating margin of 45% during the quarter, driven by revenue growth and focus on operating expenses. Non-GAAP R&D was $175 million and non-GAAP SG&A was $230 million, with the effective tax rate in the quarter at 10%. The company generated over $580 million in free cash flow and ended September 30 with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 35% is in the United States. The company repurchased approximately 475,000 shares in the quarter.

Full-year revenue guidance was increased to between $3.475 billion to $3.525 billion, representing 13% total revenue growth year-over-year. Soliris revenue guidance is $3.09 billion to $3.125 billion, while Metabolics revenue guidance is $385 million to $400 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share guidance was revised to $5.50 to $5.65, representing approximately 21% growth at the mid-point of the range.

In terms of business development, the company announced the hiring of Dr. Aradhana Sarin as Senior Vice President of Business Development and Corporate Strategy. The company plans to transition from ultra-rare to rare disease areas of focus, and is building internally a set of capabilities to execute transactions over a long period of time.

Overall, the company's financial performance in the third quarter and its revised full-year guidance suggest strong growth prospects, making it an attractive investment opportunity. With increased revenue and earnings expectations, a strong operating margin, and a focus on business development in rare disease areas, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company.
