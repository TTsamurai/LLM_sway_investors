Based on the company's recent earnings call, there are several factors that indicate caution and skepticism for potential investors. The company reported a loss for the full-year 2016, with significant decreases in earnings compared to 2015. Downstream results were particularly weak, reflecting adverse timing effects due to a rising crude price environment and extensive refinery turnaround. Additionally, corporate charges were heavier than in an average quarter, leading to a negative impact on earnings. 

Cash generated from operations was also affected by low oil and gas prices and weaker downstream margins compared to the previous year. The company's net debt stood at $39 billion, resulting in a net debt ratio of approximately 21%, indicating a significant level of debt. The company's interest expense is expected to continue growing in 2017 due to higher debt balances.

Furthermore, the company's ability to contribute to cash in 2017 is uncertain, and there are potential tax implications that could impact future financial performance. Overall, the company's financial performance raises concerns about its ability to generate positive returns for investors in the short term. Based on these factors, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company.
