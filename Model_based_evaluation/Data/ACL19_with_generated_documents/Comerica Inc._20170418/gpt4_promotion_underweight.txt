### Investment Report: Underweight Recommendation

#### Executive Overview
Based on the recent earnings call and detailed examination of financial results and strategic positioning, we recommend an underweight stance on the company’s stock. Despite visible efforts to manage the loan portfolio effectively and an overall positive sentiment echoed in the earnings call, several concerns persist that warrant caution for potential investors.

#### Primary Concerns

1. **Dependence on Interest Rates:** The company’s earnings appear heavily reliant on the favorable interest rate environment. Over 90% of the loans being of floating rate nature make the earnings significantly sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Should the interest rate environment reverse or stabilize at lower levels, the increased net interest income anticipated ($85 million) may not materialize.

2. **Vulnerability in Deposit Volumes:** The company reported a $1.9 billion decline in deposits quarter-over-quarter with a notable $1.6 billion decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits. While there has been a year-over-year increase, the company’s outlook potentially indicates an expected drop in deposit levels as the economy continues to grow. This reliance on large corporate deposit movements increases risk susceptibility especially if economic dynamics shift unexpectedly.

3. **Credit Quality and Energy Sector Exposure:** The company reported a reduction in energy loans by $289 million and expects a slower pace of reduction amid a stabilizing energy market. The optimism based on a few good E&P relationships underwrites risks inherent in sector-specific volatilities. Energy credits remain susceptible to market and geopolitical risks, potentially affecting future credit quality.

4. **High Operational Leverage to Seasonal and Policy Changes:** The reliance on seasonal rebound in sectors like auto Dealer Floor Plan and mortgage banker loans due to homebuying season, along with policy changes in Washington, present external dependencies which could impair performance if expected seasonal or political winds shift unfavorably.

5. **Weak Non-interest Income Diversification:** Non-interest income showed minimal increase, and the company is heavily reliant on specific income sources like treasury management deposit service charges, investment banking, and fiduciary income. The decline in card fees raises concerns about the diversification and stability of income sources not tied to interest rates.

6. **Management of Surplus Liquidity:** The cautious stance on deploying surplus liquidity and concerns about deposit level fluctuations as economic conditions evolve might lead to under-utilization of available capital or missed opportunities in strengthening the loan book or other income-generating avenues.

#### Conclusion
Given these vulnerabilities, particularly the high sensitivity to interest rate movements and economic conditions, investor caution is recommended. The positive earnings call narrative appears somewhat overshadowed by the underlying risks associated with operational leverage to external factors and sector-specific volatilities. As such, an underweight position is prudent until more robust mechanisms are demonstrated to mitigate these sensitivities and stabilize income sources beyond interest rate-dependent streams.
