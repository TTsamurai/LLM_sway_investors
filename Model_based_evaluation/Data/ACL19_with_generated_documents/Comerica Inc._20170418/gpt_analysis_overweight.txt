In preparing a future outlook report for the company, the following key insights and financial metrics should be considered:

1. Loan Portfolios: The company has experienced a decrease in mortgage banker loans and energy loans, with the expectation of rebounding mortgage banker balances in the upcoming spring and summer home buying season, and a slower pace of reduction in loan balances as energy prices stabilize.

2. Auto Dealer Floor Plan Portfolio: The portfolio increased as dealers continue to build inventory for the upcoming spring sales, indicating potential growth for the total loan book in the future.

3. Deposits: Although deposits declined relative to the fourth quarter, period-end deposits were above the average, indicating a positive trend. Noninterest-bearing deposits represent a majority of the deposit mix, with deposit costs remaining low.

4. Securities Portfolio: The company maintains the size of its securities book while actively managing the portfolio and has seen the total yield on the portfolio increase slightly.

5. Net Interest Income and Margin: Net interest income and margin have increased, primarily due to the loan portfolio adding to the margin and the increase in interest rates.

6. Credit Quality: Total criticized loans and nonaccrual loans have declined, and net charge-offs are below the normal historical range, reflecting strong credit quality.

7. Non-interest Income: Non-interest income has increased, driven by strong treasury management deposit service charges, investment banking, and fiduciary income.

8. Expenses: Operating expenses have declined, and the company's GEAR Up initiatives continue to contribute to expense control.

9. Stock Buyback and Dividends: The company has increased its stock buyback and returned funds to shareholders through dividends, with a focus on returning excess capital to shareholders.

10. Asset-Sensitive Balance Sheet: The company's balance sheet is asset-sensitive, positioning it to benefit from increases in interest rates.

Based on these insights and financial metrics, an 'overweight' investment stance can be recommended, indicating confidence in the company's future growth potential and profitability. The expected rebound in mortgage banker balances, growth in the auto dealer floor plan portfolio, strong credit quality, and the company's focus on returning excess capital to shareholders are positive indicators for the company's future outlook. Additionally, the company's asset-sensitive balance sheet positions it well to benefit from increases in interest rates, contributing to potential growth in net interest income.
