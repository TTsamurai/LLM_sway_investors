**Earnings Conference Call Summary – Key Financial Metrics Review**

**Loan Portfolio Analysis:**
1. **Mortgage Banker Loans**: There was a decrease of $102 million attributed to a slowdown in home sales due to weather conditions and a reduction in refinancing volumes. The ratio of purchases to refinances was 77% versus the industry average of 39%.

2. **Energy Loans**: Decreased by $289 million as customers deleveraged through asset sales and capital raises. Despite a reduction, the pace of loan balance declines is expected to slow due to stabilized energy prices and an increased rig count.

3. **Auto Dealer Floor Plan Portfolio**: Increased by $144 million, reflecting inventory buildup in anticipation of spring sales.

4. **Overall Loan Book**: Began to show growth in late February with a better performance in March, leading to period-end loans being higher than the quarter’s average.

**Deposits and Borrowing:**
1. **Deposits**: Period-end deposits stood at $58.9 billion, down $1.9 billion from the prior quarter mainly due to a $1.6 billion decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits. However, noninterest-bearing deposits have grown $2.4 billion year-over-year, now representing 53% of the deposit mix. Deposit cost remained low at 14 basis points.

2. **Securities Portfolio Management**: Yield on the portfolio marginally increased by one basis point as the company managed investment of prepayments at slightly higher rates. The mortgage rates rise had minimal impact on prepayment speeds, with a portfolio duration of about 3.5 years.

**Net Interest Income and Profitability:**
1. **Net Interest Income**: Increased by $15 million, while the net interest margin saw a rise of 21 basis points, partially supported by benefits from the rise in interest rates amounting to $23 million.

2. **Credit Quality**: Overall strong, with a decrease of over $200 million in criticized loans. Nonaccrual loans decreased by $61 million, now representing just 1.1% of total loans. Allowance for credit losses declined by $17 million.

**Capital Management and Shareholder Returns:**
1. **Buybacks and Dividends**: $105 million was spent on repurchases under the equity repurchase program; total $147 million returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.

2. **Capital Adequacy**: The company confirmed strong capital ratios and continues to target meaningful return of excess capital to shareholders.

**Outlook and Forward-Looking Statements:**
1. **Interest Rate Impact**: With over 90% of loans being floating rate, any increase in rates is expected to quickly reprice the loan portfolio. Update in net interest income outlook to an additional $85 million over 12 months due to recent rate rises.

2. **Economic Dependence**: Pending economic growth, there is an expectation of deploying excess liquidity into businesses, which might reduce deposit levels but potentially increase loan growth.

**Conclusion and Analyst Guidance:**
The company remains cautiously optimistic amid improving economic conditions and a positive regulatory environment in Washington. Continued management of loan portfolio quality and capital allocation will be crucial in sustaining growth and profitability. The focus will also remain on strategic management of interest income in the context of rising rates and maintaining competitive deposit costs.
