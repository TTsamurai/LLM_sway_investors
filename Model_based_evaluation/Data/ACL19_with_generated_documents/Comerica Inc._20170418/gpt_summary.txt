Based on the recent earnings conference call transcripts, the following key financial metrics can be highlighted:

1. Loan Portfolio:
   - Mortgage banker loans decreased due to weather slowdown in home sales and lower refi volumes, rebounding in the spring and summer home buying season.
   - Energy loans decreased as customers deleverage through asset sales and capital raises, expected to slow down as energy prices have stabilized and rig count has increased.

2. Dealer Floor Plan Portfolio:
   - Increased as dealers continue to build inventory in preparation for the pickup in spring sales.

3. Commitments and Loans:
   - Loan pipeline increased, commitments to commit grew 44% to $1.2 billion.
   - Period-end loans were above average for the quarter.

4. Deposit and Deposits Base:
   - Deposits declined relative to the fourth quarter, but were well above the average, indicating a positive trend.
   - Noninterest-bearing deposits increased, now representing 53% of the mix.
   - Deposit costs remained low at 14 basis points.

5. Net Interest Income and Margin:
   - Net interest income increased and the net interest margin also increased, primarily driven by the loan portfolio.
   - Interest rate increases provided a benefit, partially offset by other factors such as lease residual adjustments and wholesale funding costs.

6. Credit Quality:
   - Total criticized loans declined, now about 5.5% of total loans at quarter-end.
   - Nonaccrual loans decreased, representing only 1.1% of total loans.
   - Net charge-offs were below historical range, indicating continued strong credit quality and improving energy credit metrics.

7. Non-Interest Income and Expenses:
   - Non-interest income increased, driven by strong treasury management deposit service charges, investment banking, and fiduciary income.
   - Expenses declined, with reductions in most categories, including restructuring charges and litigation-related settlement.

8. Stock Buyback and Capital Plan:
   - Increased stock buyback with $105 million of repurchases in the first quarter under equity repurchase program, returning $147 million to shareholders.

9. Balance Sheet Sensitivity to Rates:
   - Over 90% of loans are floating rate, positioning the balance sheet to benefit from rate increases.
