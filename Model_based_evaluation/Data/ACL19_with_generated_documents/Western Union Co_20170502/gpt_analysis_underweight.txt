 six months. So there is a significant potential for growth there. Thank you. Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript and key financial metrics, it is evident that the company's revenue growth is primarily driven by strong performance in westernunion.com and the Consumer-to-Business segment. However, there are several factors that make it challenging for the company to maintain a sustained growth trajectory. 

The impact of currency translation, net of hedge benefits, reduced first quarter revenue by approximately $30 million compared to the prior year. The World Bank's updated cross-border remittance principal estimates indicate a decline in the overall market, and projections for an improvement in 2017 are driven by a stronger global economic outlook. Revenue in the Europe and CIS region declined, while the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia region also experienced negative growth due to low oil prices and reduced sends from these countries into India. 

The company's adjusted operating margin declined due to foreign exchange impacts, and the increased tax rate also affected adjusted earnings per share. Additionally, Business Solutions revenues declined, impacting the overall profitability. 

While the company is affirming its full-year outlook, the anticipated benefits from the cost savings initiatives and the impact of foreign exchange rates may not be enough to offset the challenges in various regions and segments. The loss of XE.com business is expected to have a negative impact on revenue growth, and the investment required to improve performance in the Western Union Business Solutions segment could also pose a challenge. 

Overall, the company's current performance and future outlook suggest that it may face difficulties in maintaining sustained revenue and profitability growth, especially in the face of global economic uncertainties and regional challenges. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance would be advisable until the company demonstrates a more robust and sustainable growth strategy.
