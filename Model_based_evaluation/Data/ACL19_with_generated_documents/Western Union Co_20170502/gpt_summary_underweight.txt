 quarter. At the end of the day, we are pretty far away to the potential of that business. The margins, we had in the business, even the top-line is also less really to India or Nigeria or other countries, which we have huge potential. So, focus is absolutely there. And the future outlook is really good. And thank you for that. I mean, the C2C growth that we saw in the quarter, we feel good about it. There was nothing one-time in the quarter that drove that growth, and it was broad-based across many of our sending markets. We continue to invest in our global network and our digital expansion, and we feel good about it. So, the growth in the quarter was no different really in the markets that we operate. And we do anticipate, you asked about outlook, that we do anticipate that the growth in the quarter is going to sustain itself into subsequent quarters, and into the second quarter. So, don't see it as a one-time good quarter that we had, and we hope that – we feel like it's going to continue. So, the trends in the quarter were very good, and we'll see what happens. But we're very focused on growing our customer base and continuing to expand into new territories. That's our main focus right now. Thank you for your question. And our team at WU Way has really been working very hard to change how we innovate, how we operate, how we really think about ourselves, and how we apply modern technology and data to enable us to become a customer-centric company focused on financing. I'm actually very excited on what has been done and what is going to happen – Airbus in the money transfer and payments industry. We find – I find we have a huge potential to continue providing compelling service to our customers. That being said, as every other sector, we are facing the modern reality with the digitalization and so on. We're really investing into new scenarios, new products, into digital. I believe this is the really potential, with certain changes – digitize our business and keep our margin stable. Back to you to your last question, the good news is that we have achieved cost saving and have been practicing efficiencies all around everything including investment in digital. So very clear, I will be able to tell you that there will be room for efficiencies. I mean, in EBITDA and also the enduring cost. So I think that our margin really in that would be steady. I believe very clear, and it will be based on what we are focusing on the future. Thank you for your question. Thank you for the question. I don't really want to get into forward guidance on Pacific segments, C2C, etc. my goal really is to have good, solid revenue and transaction growth. We think that we can achieve that in both the retail business and in the Business Solutions business. So, when think the overall philosophy for the company is that we want to grow our business, we think that we can add customers and add revenue, we want to expand margins where we can, and we want to also look at the return on invested capital to see if that is improving as well to continue to drive the business forward. So thank you for the question. Thank you for the question. On the cost for the abnormal tax benefit, or the timing, we expect to realize these in the fourth quarter. We had, let's say, a weaker first quarter tax rate due to the impact of these changes in the internal ownership structure. And moving forward, we expect that there will be – the tax rate will be closer to normal quarter tax rates in the second and third quarters, and then substantially lower in the fourth quarter, like the prior year. Thank you for the question. Thank you for the question. The effective tax rate at the beginning of the year was about 24.1% related to changes in the internal ownership structure of certain of the company's international subsidiaries. And our planned activities carry about an 11% tax rate for the full year, which will be offset by lower taxes of a comparable amount throughout the remainder of the year due to the structural changes. The GAAP earnings per share of $0.33 excludes a negative $0.02 impact from the WU Way-related expenses. We expect to beat industry expectations in the second, third, and fourth quarter. Thank you for the question. On the plan for optimizing the marketing expenses. Yeah, we're always looking for opportunities to optimize how we spend art. And over time, the composition of how we spent that money has changed, right – and as we've completed many of the Southwest border requirements, that spending has gotten less over the last couple of years, but it's migrated to other programs. So, we're always putting technology in place, and we want to automate those things. Our first priority this year really is to address the requirements that we have under these settlement agreements, and then looking to stabilize as much as we can over time. Thank you for the question. Thank you for the question. The World Bank is very optimistic about the remittances forecast for the upcoming years. This quarter's performance in the regions was very strong in terms of both revenue and transaction growth. I believe we had good growth in the quarter and I believe we will continue to see that growth continuing into subsequent quarters. Thank you for your questions. That's a good question. Thank you. I'm glad you asked about our cash balance and debt levels. At the end of the quarter, we had debt of $3.5 billion and cash of $1.3 billion. Approximately half of the cash is held by United States entities. And during the quarter, we issued $400 million of five-year notes with a coupon of 0.6% Thank you for the question. Thank you for the question. We're excited about the Facebook announcement and the potential there. It's a great product. Our customers really do need to leave the messenger environment to do a transaction, but for us it's just another channel to allow customers to do a transaction with us. It's too early as we're in the early stages but we are excited about our customers doing a transaction with us. Thank you for the questions. Thank you for the questions. It has been a great pleasure to speak with you. I hope we've addressed your questions. Thank you again. Thank you for your questions. I hope we've done everything that's achievable today. Thank you.
