Based on the recent earnings call, I would recommend an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. While the second quarter results showed a 4% increase in comparable store sales and an improvement in operating margin, there are some concerning factors to consider. Despite the increase in sales, the company's merchandise margin is projected to be slightly lower in the third quarter due to a challenging comparison from the previous year. Additionally, the company's plan to repurchase a significant amount of stock raises questions about their investment priorities and potential impact on future growth opportunities. Furthermore, the company's reliance on credit sales and the potential headwind from increasing freight costs are reasons for caution. Overall, it is prudent to approach investment in this company with a skeptical perspective and consider an 'underweight' allocation in your investment portfolio.
