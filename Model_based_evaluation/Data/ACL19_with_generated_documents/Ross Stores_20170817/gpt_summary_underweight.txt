Based on the earnings conference call transcript, it is clear that the company's second quarter results were strong, with a 4% increase in comparable store sales and a 50 basis point increase in operating margin. However, the increase in freight costs and higher buying costs offset some of the gains from improved merchandise margin and lower expenses.

The company's guidance for the third and fourth quarters also indicates positive sales growth and earnings per share projections, with same-store sales projected to increase 1% to 2% in both quarters. Additionally, the company plans to repurchase a significant amount of stock for the year, signaling confidence in its future performance.

However, there are some concerns with merchandise margins being slightly lower in the third quarter, and potential headwinds from freight costs for the rest of the year. Furthermore, the company has seen a decline in new store productivity since entering the Midwest in 2011 and the growth of its ddâ€™s DISCOUNTS chain, which may impact future performance.

Overall, considering the potential headwinds and concerns about declining new store productivity, we believe it is prudent to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. Further analysis of key financial metrics such as profit margins, inventory levels, and sales growth will be necessary to support this recommendation.
