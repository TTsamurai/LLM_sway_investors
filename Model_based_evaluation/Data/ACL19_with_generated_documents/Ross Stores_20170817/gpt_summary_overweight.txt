Key financial metrics:

1. Comparable store sales gain of 4% in the second quarter
2. 50 basis point increase in operating margin to 14.9%
3. 25 basis point improvement in cost of goods sold driven by a 35 basis point increase in merchandise margin
4. 25 basis point decrease in selling, general, and administrative expenses
5. Repurchase of 3.6 million shares of common stock for $215 million in the quarter
6. Planned repurchase of a total of $875 million in stock for the year
7. Forecasted same-store sales increase of 1-2% for the third and fourth quarters
8. Projected earnings per share of $0.64-$0.67 in the third quarter and $0.88-$0.92 in the fourth quarter
9. Total sales projected to grow 4-5% in the third quarter
10. Operating margin projected to be 12.4-12.6% in the third quarter
11. Projected full-year earnings per share increase of 12-14% to $3.16-$3.23 on a 53-week basis

Based on the strong second quarter results and positive guidance for the second half of the year, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance in the company. The improvement in key financial metrics such as operating margin and cost of goods sold, along with the planned stock repurchase program, suggests a positive outlook for the company's financial performance. Additionally, the forecasted same-store sales increases and earnings per share projections for the third and fourth quarters further support a bullish investment stance.
