Based on the recent earnings call of the company, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance. The company's performance in the second quarter exceeded expectations with a 4% comparable store sales gain driven by increases in both traffic and the size of the average basket. The operating margin also outperformed projections, increasing 50 basis points to 14.9%. The company's cost of goods sold improved by 25 basis points, driven by a better than expected 35 basis point increase in merchandise margin. Additionally, the company repurchased 3.6 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $215 million in the second quarter and a total of 6.9 million shares for an aggregate price of $430 million year-to-date.

The guidance for the third and fourth quarters also looks promising, with same-store sales projected to increase 1% to 2% in the third quarter and 1% to 2% in the fourth quarter. Earnings per share are projected to increase to $0.64 to $0.67 in the third quarter and $0.88 to $0.92 in the fourth quarter.

The company is also planning to add new store locations, with 30 new Ross and 10 dd's DISCOUNTS locations expected to open. The company is also projecting an increase in earnings per share for the full year on a 53-week basis to be in the range of $3.16 to $3.23, representing a 12% to 14% increase from the previous year.

Based on these strong performance indicators and positive guidance, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company's strategic initiatives, strong financial performance, and projected growth in sales and earnings make it an attractive investment opportunity.
