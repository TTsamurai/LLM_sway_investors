 for your question. We certainly appreciate that you are interested in our acquisition of Valspar and the future opportunities it presents. We believe that the combination of the two companies will differentiate us in the global paints and coatings market by expanding our brand portfolio, customer relationships, and capabilities. We are excited about the opportunities that this combination will provide to all employees of the new company.

In terms of financial performance, our results for the second quarter were affected both by sales and profitability challenges. Adjusted for the revenue classification, our core gross margin declined and SG&A as a percent of sales also declined. However, adjusted operating margin increased and profit before tax improved from last year. Our sales to residential repaint contractors continued to grow at a double-digit pace, while exterior paint sales momentum appears to be rebounding in July. Revenue and volume momentum in our North American paint stores slowed somewhat from the pace set in the first quarter. 

In terms of our business in Latin America, while some regions are showing improvement, our largest market in the region, Brazil, continues to struggle. We also made significant store and sales territory expansions in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America, and our confidence in the residential repaint, new residential, and commercial markets remains positive.

The combination of Valspar's architectural paint business and related products held up well, and we have confidence in the team and their ability to deliver on synergies. Our focus is on helping our customers drive traffic and convert those footsteps into sales, and we are working on solutions to help them compete in the market. We anticipate Sherwin-Williams' core net sales to increase in the low to mid-single-digit percentage compared to last year's third quarter, and we expect incremental sales from the Valspar acquisition to be approximately $1 billion in the quarter. 

For the full year 2017, we expect Sherwin-Williams' core net sales to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage compared to full year 2016, with incremental sales from the Valspar acquisition estimated at approximately $2.4 billion. Our full year 2017 diluted net income per common share guidance reflects an increase from Valspar operations net of acquisition finance expenses. 

In terms of the integration process, we are actively pursuing opportunities for synergy and growth, although it will take time to capture these opportunities. We are working with our customers to align our products and services with their needs and are confident in our ability to drive volume growth and market share growth in the months ahead.

In conclusion, we are approaching the future with an 'overweight' investment stance due to the potential for growth and synergies from the combined company. We are working hard to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the acquisition and are confident in our ability to deliver value to our customers and shareholders. Thank you for joining us and we look forward to continued success in the future.
