As a stock promoter, I am pleased to present a compelling promotion for investment in our company. Based on the recent earnings call, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance. Here's why:

- Our leasing activity in the fourth quarter was impressive, with significant annualized GAAP revenue and new leases totaling $25 million.
- We signed new leases with top cloud service providers across multiple continents and experienced strong customer demand from key verticals such as cable and network, ridesharing, IT service providers, and financial services.
- The acquisition of Telx in late 2015 has proven to be successful, with consistent performance and revenue growth exceeding 10% in the interconnection business.
- Our backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $78 million, with a quick lag between signings and commencements.
- Renewal leasing activity retained 75% of lease expirations, with positive cash re-leasing spreads for the fourth quarter and full year 2016.
- Overall portfolio occupancy is up 50 basis points sequentially to 89.4%, and we are actively negotiating leases to bring us back to breakeven in certain areas.

In terms of financials, our core FFO per share for the full year increased by nearly 9%, and AFFO per share growth was better than 20% for the full year. Our current AFFO payout ratio is sub-70%, providing flexibility for further dividend growth.

Our balance sheet is strong, with minimal secured debt remaining, and leverage reduced from 5.2 times to 4.8 times at the end of 2016. Our sources and uses of funds, including prepayment of mortgage debt and early retirement of senior notes, demonstrate prudent capital management.

Further, our committed spending on our active development pipeline is sustainable and can be easily addressed with available credit facilities. Our global footprint expansion in Europe and Asia, along with revenue synergies from footprint expansion in key markets, create a positive outlook for future growth.

Based on these factors, I believe an 'overweight' investment stance is warranted for our company. We are well-positioned for continued growth and profitability. Thank you for considering this compelling investment opportunity.
