Based on the earnings conference call transcript, several key financial metrics stand out:

1. Leasing Activity: The company has reported $33 million in total bookings for the fourth quarter, including a $7.5 million contribution from interconnection. This speaks to the company's ability to win profitable demand from a diverse global customer set.

2. Revenue Growth: The Telx business generated $99 million of revenue during the fourth quarter, with interconnection revenue outpacing colocation revenue and year-over-year growth in excess of 10%. The company also reported positive cash re-leasing spreads for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016.

3. Portfolio Optimization: The company has a current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced at $78 million, with a weighted average lag between signings and commencements of just three months. The company also has plans to prune its portfolio and sell up to another $200 million of assets this year.

4. Balance Sheet and Debt Management: The company has focused on managing currency risk by issuing locally denominated debt as a natural hedge, and has mitigated interest rate risk by terming out short-term variable rate debt with longer-term fixed rate financing. The company expects to raise another $500 million of long-term fixed rate financing later this year.

5. Financial Performance and Forecast: The company reported core FFO per share of $5.72 for the full year, an increase of nearly 9% on a reported basis, and growth in AFFO per share of better than 20% for the full year. The company is reiterating guidance for 2017 and expects AFFO per share growth to more closely match FFO per share growth.

Based on these financial metrics and the company's strategic initiatives, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company has demonstrated strong leasing activity, revenue growth, portfolio optimization, and effective balance sheet and debt management. Additionally, the company's financial performance and forecast show promising growth potential for investors.
