. Our outlook for the underweight investment stance is based on the following key financial metrics:

- Total bookings for the fourth quarter were approximately $33 million of annualized GAAP revenue, including a $7.5 million contribution from interconnection.
- The Telx business generated $99 million of revenue during the fourth quarter, with year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 10% in interconnection.
- Same capital cash NOI growth was flat for the fourth quarter and up 1.4% on a constant currency basis for the full year.
- Core FFO per share for the full year increased by nearly 9% on a reported basis and over 10% on a constant currency basis.
- We expect AFFO per share growth to closely match FFO per share growth in 2017.

Overall, while the company has shown positive financial performance with revenue growth and successful integration of new acquisitions, our analysis indicates a cautious approach due to potential risks such as FX exposure, variable interest rates, and potential challenges in leasing and renewal activities.
