Based on the conference call transcript, it is clear that the company has seen strong leasing activity during the fourth quarter. Some key financial metrics to focus on include:
- Total bookings for the fourth quarter were approximately $33 million of annualized GAAP revenue, including a $7.5 million contribution from interconnection.
- The Telx business generated $99 million of revenue during the fourth quarter, with interconnection outpacing colocation with year-over-year revenue growth in excess of 10%.
- Same capital cash NOI growth was flat for the fourth quarter and up 1.4% on a constant currency basis.

In addition, it is important to note that the company is reiterating its guidance for 2017, and the balance sheet is well-positioned for growth, with net debt to adjusted EBITDA expected to remain below five times throughout the entire year. The company also expects to raise another $500 million of long-term fixed-rate financing later this year.

Overall, the performance of the colocation and interconnection product line is strong, and the company is well-positioned for continued progress and growth in the coming year.
