2. **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**:
   - **Diluted EPS and adjusted EPS increased by 33% and 29%**, respectively. This growth is underpinned by strong revenue outputs and effective capital optimization, including an 8% reduction in average weighted diluted share count.

   - The quarter benefited from a lower effective tax rate of 28.2%, significantly below the prior year's rate, contributing to the improved profitability.

5. **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**:

**Market Position and Future Outlook:**

MSCI’s market position has been further solidified through consistent growth in asset-under-management (AUM) and the expanding influence in developed and emerging market ETFs. The diverse and strategically expanding product portfolio underpins a positive long-term outlook, despite short-term market volatilities.

**Capital and Shareholder Returns:**

The ongoing share repurchase program and substantial shareholder returns since 2012 reflect strong financial health and management’s confidence in sustained future performance.
