According to the recent earnings conference call transcript, the company continues to show strong performance and momentum coming out of 2016. Q1 results indicated an 8% increase in revenue, primarily driven by a 6% increase in recurring subscription revenue and an 18% increase in asset-based fee revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 50%, and adjusted EPS increased by 29%.

The Index segment showed a 13% increase in revenues and a 70.8% adjusted EBITDA margin. Asset-based fees increased 18%, primarily driven by higher revenue from ETFs linked to MSCI indexes and a 28% increase in average AUM. The Analytics segment saw a 2% increase in revenues, primarily due to higher equity model revenue. The year-over-year comparison reflects the negative impact of challenging market conditions, with increased cancels in the last three quarters of the prior year. The All Other segment's revenues increased by 6%, and the adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 21.8%, driven by strong growth in ESG revenue and lower Real Estate costs.

The company's capital return activity included the repurchase and settlement of 1.1 million shares. The company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $697 million and a growth leverage of 3.6 times. The company reaffirmed its full-year 2017 guidance and long-term targets.

Overall, the company is well positioned for continued growth, with strong operating results driving double-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The company is optimistic about its prospects for continued growth.

Based on the strong financial metrics and performance highlighted in the conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for the company's stock. The company's execution against its strategy and continued growth trajectory suggest positive prospects for future returns on investment.
