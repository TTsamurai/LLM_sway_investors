 that we can deliver to them that no other company can. So as we say, someone sees the other guy and can build them a part, and we can help them with a little bit of software here. But when they look at our solution, even if it looks complex initially, they understand it's a complete solution and that they really can't gather the same set of resources and IP anywhere else. That is really resonating well with people. But great question. It's not easy and it takes a lot of detailed understanding of each one of the customer's problems and not a one-size-fits-all approach. So. Yes, those markets were strong. And I'll tell you why I think they were strong. Architecture decisions have already been made in many of these platforms and these markets around our Xeon Scalables. And so now that those units are coming out, they're in full production, full shipment, and the growth there has been very strong. It's largely based on those architecture decisions and part of our planning and execution to be able to see plug-ins to the architectures that we have and expertise in those areas and these architectures and understand how we can take greater share in those market segments. Market share growth, Stacy. Market segments. And I'll let Navin talk about this, who's really driving this. I think Stacy had another question on it. Yeah, let's talk a little bit more about it. Ok, as you look at memory right now, where we're seeing 3D NAND, I'll say over the last six months, we've really started to see the impact of what's going on with bits and yields. The combination of those two things have actually raised the need or the push for shipments, which has actually made us work our Intel factory fab system as tight as we've worked it in probably three years. So we're driving the profitability and the – especially with the yield improvement, while increasing throughput. And we're also seeing a mix shift in our product line, which is raising ASP. So yes, that's sustaining today. It's hard for me to say how long that trend is, but I'd say for the near-term future, that looks very positive for us. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC All right, I'll pass on. Thanks a lot. So just we don't break out by revenue by data-centric workload, and there are a variety of reasons for that. Part of it is trying to understand exactly what the mix of those data center end users is doing any given time, and part of it is more the mixture, the most complicated bespoke parts that people order. So first off, we don't really break out quite like that, but – and I have a second scenario, I'm not sure what the first scenario was, Stacy, but I'll just go with what the second was. You know, there are the large cloud guys that are bringing third-party co-location data centers, they're really building their own data centers themselves, as well as some really light co-location. Other people are really starting to push the data center of their own out at the edge, pushing things into edge computing. And that is a much more difficult architecture to figure out, to put workload on than the traditional data center model. So we think the edge is really going to be a driver of increasing our TAM and helping us to grow as we go into Q4 and the next year. So I wouldn't say it's like some big step function, Stacy, but I do see a world where we're going to be not just happy but growing as we get into it. So Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Got it. Thank you. And then, just real quickly on the edge. I guess there's been a lot of talk about edge computing, IoT, things like that. Can you talk to us about what you're seeing in edge right now? Are people starting to spend there yet? Are they starting to think about putting in infrastructure there yet? Or is this more of a next year kind of thing? Thank you. Charles E. B. Triano - Intel Corp. I spent some time bringing up on the 14-nanometer things that we're doing. First off, we shipped the industry's first 64-layer data center SSDs on 3D NAND that was in production most of this quarter, and it was a very good product. And I also mentioned that our customers have a lot of interest in LTSAs. The LTSAs are to really get much more reach-ahead, not just for next year's supply but really much more make-or-buy absolute kind of decisions. We've signed two of them already, including one with the Chinese company, and we have a pretty strong pipeline. We're hearing a lot of interest in that in the customer base. I also talked about our factory in Dalian. Just both on its ramp rate of how fast we're getting that going and pushing the yield – raising and raising the yield rates out of it. And so you see memory become a really bright, new spot in our business. And the pressure there is still quite tight today. And as you move to 3D NAND, in particular, which is as I mentioned is more than 70% of our total piece parts, the revenue mix, our teams have made those transitions very well. Charles E. B. Triano - Intel Corp. Right. Charles E. B. Triano - Intel Corp. So FPGAs are up 10% in the third quarter. So let's start with that they were up 10% in the third quarter. There was growth in the data center, and the strength in the data center – there was data back in the comms infrastructure and there was growth in the automotive segments. So as we look at the next wave of products for FPGAs, we're considering them to sell very well into the data center. We have systems that have been designed into FPGAs at Intel are doing great, and I think you'll see them really resonate into the customer base and also from designs to business wins, which have always been really difficult conversations, were up in the high single digits. So we really feel great about that business. Jonathan Mallard Pan - JPMorgan Securities LLC - Analyst Okay, thank you. Let in your prepared comments, Brian, you mentioned later this quarter, shipping Nervana. Is that still in the queue or do you have visibility at this stage? Thanks. That is the start. That was the 17 qubit test chip, and we'll follow that up with a 49 qubit test chip by the end of the year. So those get you a little bit of visibility. And the rest of the AI processing will be out – with our first neural network processor announced last week, Ashley. And we announced last week that Facebook is working in close collaboration with us. We announced our branding called the Nervana, Ashley, last week at the Future Decoded show in London. But I'd like to not just leave it at Nervana but also talk about Loihi. Another piece of really innovative compute here is Loihi. And what Loihi brings to us is the self-learning piece. So it's a chip where you can throw out the problem that you'd like to solve. It's very good at operations around learning and memory. It can solve those problems much faster and more efficiently than we've been able to do in the past. Jonathan Mallard Pan - JPMorgan Securities LLC - Analyst Got it. Thanks, Bob. Just one question before that. On the 49 qubit test chip, the early part of next year, how quickly from the time that chip comes out to the time that fully commercially available solution is out, should we think about hearing about that? Do you have any visibility on when Nervana will start to impact the P&L?. So there's a lot we could talk about here. Obviously, the first part of the conversation is about each stripe of business we've had. I know when I first started off, I said a couple times we're seeing convergence of our various businesses, and you're seeing more and more of that today. We're seeing in the case of a specific product, but not just one product but the full suite of products that are convincing our customers to really jump on board with us in autonomous driving. Automotive modems, our leading position there really has been facilitated by the staff of our own building of the modem team and building the leading modem within Intel Corporation, the best one there is in the industry today. But then what you tie into that is our MPU business, where we have the ability to see those things back in a data center and talk about it as architected from the cloud all the way back out to the edge. And that's really central to the strategy, and it's resonating with even – I won't tell you what I've seen in the last couple months about a chip clone, but I've seen some artwork that people are designing that does not look all that dissimilar to what we're doing in handheld systems within Intel Corporation today. In between those two components, kind of what I classify as a classic MPU and a modem at the edge, is Mobileye, which is – we're beginning to go from just OEM data to, "Let's talk about what Rolls-Royce can do" and "What people typically do in DARPA" and "OK, last year, in NASA robotics, it does this or that thing." We just beat another 12 wins into that market and it's happening for us, and it's happening at the fastest rate today and it's resonating. And I won't even get into the IoT analytical piece. Already, we've really been able to go into those segments, we're selling to the industrial markets – really great results with high content wins in video, really a big win amongst a couple of our competitors nationally. And even with infotainment – some of my relationships with some of the OEMs we have there, like in DENSO, were not the ones who recommended me for the last 10 wins that they had in Level 3, so they got hurt. But let me tell you, it's a lot of effort and it's really beginning to pay off, and there's no better place to go. I think that's the ERC at least at Intel Corporation, and we're seeing that module after module. So, great quarter. That's a pretty complete package for you.. Sure, those are great questions. Architecture decisions on large markets and new MSR, as we called it in the past, but machine learning, so that's architecture decisions we made two years ago. So when you make that decision, it's much different when you land it in some production. We're really just starting out now. So as those come into production, they're already now pushing the rest of our hand, where other comms infrastructure is coming back up. There's been a big round there. Eureka. The FPGAs are starting to really be looked at and used in low volume, so that pressure will remain certainly through the start of next year. Really, that's what's tipping the market to where it is today. Really, focus on how you get to that next wave of products and where you are. There's much more to come in the market. I have many chips that have shown up with just corresponding blocking, a little timing issue, the ones that work. So the approved ones tell you, already certain ports and products will be well-designed and are the ones that have little things to improve. And so the majority of those should be out relatively quickly, and so we're really – it's a good time in the market. There's a lot to do. We're really picking up and we're seeing everywhere. And we're leading in this market too, so keep an eye out. Good stuff. Jonathan Mallard Pan - JPMorgan Securities LLC - Analyst Great. A couple specific questions and then one broader question for Brian. Should we think about 10-nanometer – sort of first half of next year process? When are we going to start to see products there, not just in sort of high volume but in systems even Availability. And then I have a broader question about the IoT and FPGA businesses. We're seeing design win revenue value ist over the last three years. I'm not sure that the absolute dollar number tells us as much as I'd like to know as well as that last statement. Do you think 10% indicates to us from your view that you're outperforming your competition in particular segments or is it just that the FPGA market is getting better? And then the bigger question is, you talk about examples across the divisions about our competitors or the like, but can you give us a sense of who the main competitors are across the board at Intel today, the main competitors that you see in these spaces? Charles E. B. Triano - Intel Corp. Well, when you think about how we grow a business, these are very different businesses today. As I first mentioned, there are three pillars to our business unit. So, in Brad's world, our temptation is to think that this is just a growing comp. And really what that comes down to be substantially in Armin's business, and for Charles, what's the order of this business? We do have different competitors in each one of those applications, Stacy, but if I think about it very generally, we do invest in our business, and we invest in our customer. We absolutely want them to be able to speak to them and to be able to taste a product and understand what it is that we're delivering. So with that, we're willing to help nudge customers from 9th Gen to what have you, how much recovery do you like, two or four – anyway, some of those can be important conversation, and we're happy to have them. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. And then just a final one. We've seen a lot of strategic deals at Intel over the last couple of years. Are there more big strategic opportunities like the Mobileye out there for you to execute, or have you exhausted I/O options at this point?. Yes, so Mobileye, we closed the transaction early, about four months early, and we have already been seeing wins out of that at a faster rate than what we did all of it last year. It's ahead and wins are ahead and the trajectory looks good for 2018. Let's look at it through context, though, which is our strategy, back to the mission of Intel: be the driving force in the data revolution across technology and in the industry. We will absolutely make an I/O, Stacy, along with anything that ties into our common industry corp. So whether it's an asset that gives us unique expertise or the expertise of individuals that really anchor them into sweet spots for industry and deliver those customer solutions, yes, we will absolutely consider them. No doors are closed. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Got it. Thank you. That was very helpful. Jonathan Mallard Pan - JPMorgan Securities LLC - Analyst Thank you. And then maybe just a big picture question for Navin. Your commentary, Navin, on the Client Computing Group, if you could look out beyond the GPU, how do you think about market segmentation and building a future growth story for that business? Thanks.  Sure. I mean, what I've been able to do is really focus on with our products and with our manufacturing teams and, for that matter, with our sales team as well is a drive the focus of the sales team and marketing team into those product areas where we think they have the most to offer for Intel, which is this whole server product line, Intel is the server chip. From IOT to meltdown through the edge, and that will discuss its networking of everything that we're offering there. We're seeing a cleaner, tighter architectural play in gaming, supporting those new workstation designs, really nice new work we've done there to all the advancements we have in the PCs. So we're really working to angle all of those customers towards Intel. And we're seeing big traction in all of those areas because they see us building complete, simple solutions for a variety of complex problems. It's really going to be money in the pocket for them, and we plan on really looking and seeking from customers that that's the value that they're seeing as they decide where to go forward. Jonathan Mallard Pan - JPMorgan Securities LLC - Analyst Thank you. That's helpful. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC All right. Thank you. Do you think you have these all and your ability to throw them out to the front is the foundation for what we're seeing over the last couple periods, and it's really resonating with customers. Thank you, all for joining today. We think it was a fantastic quarter and a fantastic progression as we go into our final quarter, and as you can see from the guidance, we're just going to continue on that trajectory for 2018. Thank you. Jonathan Mallard Pan - JPMorgan Securities LLC - Analyst Thank you, Bob. and Brian, your comments where you said you'd be the leader in AI inference from the data center to autonomous vehicles out to the edge, as a cautious note, can you comment on that in terms of what you've seen from others in the market and what sort of conviction you have that you can maintain that going forward? Thank you.  Yes. I mean, yes. Sure. Great question, Stacy. Stacy Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Sure. And then you talked about the demand improvements in self-learning, and real computing, and innovation in products and technology. Can you comment on the competitive landscape in these areas, and how confident are you in maintaining a leadership position? And have you seen anything from the competition that would challenge that? Thank you. Brian M. Krzanich - Intel Corp. I mean, Stacy, I think we've been doing this for a long time. And you've heard us say that we've been in just about every business, specifically IOT and memory. Across those markets, I think we've been there and have a leadership position in all of them. And I'll remind you, this is what we've said though. It's not always a straight path. It's a very bumpy road. We've faced many competitors in those areas over the years. It's not just that we launched a good product and it goes there. There's a long-term relationship determination with a variety of products and their choices. And you've got to realize there's a constant of invention, made at a high level by a lot of people in your main competitors. But we also said – you've seen this out of us – we really – we have the ability to build capability instead of hiring outside or bringing people on, who's Lois is the only thing we've done. We're trying to build intellectual property and the capability from within. And so I mean, the wins you see in any of our businesses are not out of the blue. They're because we're investing the money of continued development from the early stages on up into the commerce. Jonathan Mallard Pan - JPMorgan Securities LLC - Analyst Got it, thank you. And Bob, I'll just ask then, are these businesses now stable and profitable from here, and is there potential for further large investments as we move into the near-term? Thank you.  We think so, Jonathan. It's driven really by the market demand, and we see that investment, including any deals we might make over the next year, as being opportunities to further expand those capabilities. So I think the answer is yes, and we're feeling good about our
