 that we have to offer. And the reaction so far has been pretty positive. I think you're seeing that in the numbers out of Mobileye. And the reaction we're getting from the OEMs as we bring them in and talk about our package. John Williams - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you. Bob, just one quick one for you. Are you – and obviously, you should have seen a lot of the kind of Form 10-K from mobile OEMs at this point, given the lead time introduction of new products, particularly on the modem side, customer engagements around mobile modems, particularly against what you've seen in the last 12 months? What are your thoughts around that in terms of what your customers want and what you've seen from new kind of 10-K resources? And then just a quick follow-up for Stacy, how are you being that change in that IP from the shareholders and what are your thoughts around that. Robert Holmes Swan - Intel Corp. Okay, so we can just – we're talking about modems here mostly today. But what we've done is, we think, really moved our modem organization to world-class, and it's really providing world-class modems to our customers. We have moved onto a yearly cadence, which is just critical. That's been – that allows us real consistency to get design wins. That then leads to quicker ramp times, and then we've also seen considerable amount of interest in supply agreements. And what they really do, if you think about it, is they provide us a fore-looking – for our shareholders a fore-looking view into revenue because we've already booked the deal. At the same time, for those customers fearing a shortage around the supply of modems, it allows us to really lock in an attractive supply position for the customer. So we think that's going to be – we've had good traction with that, and we think that's going to be the way – that is the way the industry's moving, and we think that's going to continue to be a considerable help to our business. As far as IP versus shareholders, we're all about creating shareholder value through innovation and execution. So we expect the shareholders and others to benefit from our growth in AI and other markets as we execute on our strategy.
