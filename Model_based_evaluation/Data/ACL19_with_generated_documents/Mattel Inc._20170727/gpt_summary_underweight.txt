Key financial metrics for the company include:

- Net sales were up 2% as reported and up 3% in constant currency versus the prior year. Gross sales were up 1% as reported and 2% in constant currency.
- Sales growth was primarily driven by Cars 3, Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Fisher-Price, but offset by declines in Monster High, Ever After High, MEGA, and American Girl.
- International segment gross sales grew 6% as reported and 8% in constant currency, with strength in Latin America and key emerging markets like China.
- North American gross sales were down 2% as reported and in constant currency, but POS was up mid-single digit.
- Gross margin for the second quarter was 41%, down 430 basis points versus 2016, primarily impacted by increased royalties, unfavorable mix, and lower licensing income.
- Advertising was down slightly as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter, and adjusted SG&A was up 4% year over year.
- Adjusted EPS for the second quarter was a loss of $0.14 compared to the prior-year loss of $0.02.
- Year-to-date cash from operations was negative $549 million, down $308 million year over year, primarily due to lower net income, higher accounts receivable, and higher Mattel-owned inventories.
- The company may not have sufficient flexibility under the current debt-to-EBITDA ratio of its credit facility at the end of the third quarter of 2017 and intends to amend the ratio before the end of the third quarter.
- The company announced a third quarter dividend of $0.15 per share compared to $0.38 per share in the third quarter of 2016.
- The company continues to target low single-digit sales growth for the year and expects the growth in the second half to be driven by incremental licensed entertainment portfolio and key power brands, partially offset by continued declines in Monster High and Ever After High.
- The company made tough calls to temper its revenue expectations to low single digits for the full year, and expects to end the year with clean retail and Mattel-owned inventory levels.

Based on these financial metrics and the company's outlook, the analyst should adopt an 'underweight' investment stance, as there are concerns about revenue growth, gross margin pressure, negative cash flow, and potential challenges with debt flexibility.
