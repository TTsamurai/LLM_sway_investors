International segment gross sales growth was 6% as reported and 8% in constant currency with POS up low double digits.

2. Gross margin: Reported gross margin for the second quarter was 41%, down 430 basis points versus 45.3% in 2016. Gross margin was impacted by increased royalties due to higher sales of licensed entertainment properties, unfavorable mix due to a shift away from higher-margin doll business, and lower licensing income.

3. Advertising and SG&A: Advertising was down slightly as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter. Adjusted SG&A was up approximately $12 million or 4% year over year for the quarter, driven primarily by employee costs related to merit increases, investment in the expansion of American Girl, and continued investments in China growth.

4. Adjusted EPS: Adjusted EPS for the second quarter was a loss of $0.14 compared to the prior-year loss of $0.02. Year-to-date tax rate was 22.8%, including discrete items.

5. Cash flow and balance sheet: Cash from operations was negative $549 million, down $308 million year over year, due to lower net income, higher accounts receivable, and higher Mattel-owned inventories. The company ended the second quarter with $275 million in cash.

6. Debt-to-EBITDA ratio: The company intends to amend the ratio under the credit facility before the end of the third quarter and is highly confident they will be able to do so.

7. Dividends and strategic investments: The board declared a third-quarter dividend of $0.15 per share compared to $0.38 per share in the third quarter of 2016. The company also plans to evaluate strategic partnerships, M&A opportunities, and share buybacks to seek the highest available returns on its capital.

8. Revenue outlook: The company has tempered its revenue expectations to low single digits for the full year and expects second-half sales to be more weighted towards the fourth quarter. They expect continued gross margin headwinds in the second half versus 2016 but also expect sequential margin improvement compared to the first half of the year. The company's overarching goals for 2017 are to exit the year with POS momentum and to end the year with clean retail and Mattel-owned inventory levels.
