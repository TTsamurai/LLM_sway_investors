. Overall, the company had a solid performance in the first quarter with strong bookings, sales, and EPS. The company's operating margin and EPS from continuing operations exceeded expectations. The company also raised its full year outlook for net sales and EPS. However, the company expects a slightly lower margin in the second quarter and an unfavorable charge associated with the early retirement of debt. The company also expects a more even distribution of cash flow throughout the year, with the majority of the cash flow weighted in the second half and particularly in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the company expects to continue working to drive down working capital and decrease the absolute balances by year-end. Despite the positive aspects of the recent earnings call, it is advised to take a cautious investment stance, as the company may face challenges with the early retirement of debt, slightly lower margins in the second quarter, and the uneven distribution of cash flow throughout the year. Therefore, it is recommended to consider an 'underweight' investment stance in light of these factors.
