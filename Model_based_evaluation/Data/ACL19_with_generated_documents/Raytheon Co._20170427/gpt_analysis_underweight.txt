Based on the company's recent earnings conference call transcript, the company experienced strong performance in the first quarter, with bookings, sales, and EPS exceeding expectations. The company raised its full-year outlook for all three measures. Bookings for the first quarter were $5.7 billion, and sales were $6 billion, with solid sales particularly in IDS and SAS businesses. Margins improved in the first quarter, and EPS from continuing operations was up 21% from the previous year. The company is also raising its full-year 2017 net sales range and increasing its full-year bookings outlook to $25.5 billion to $26.5 billion.

Despite these positive results, there are several factors that suggest an 'underweight' investment stance. While the company's performance in the first quarter was strong, the margin improvement for the full year is expected to be in the range of 12.4% to 12.6%, consistent with the guidance laid out in January. Additionally, the Q2 margin is expected to be slightly down, and the company expects cash flow to be weighted towards the second half of the year, with a majority of the cash flow weighted in Q4. This suggests potential challenges in sustaining the strong performance seen in Q1 throughout the rest of the year.

Furthermore, the company is reducing the range of its interest expense to reflect the early retirement of debt, and a non-operating charge associated with the make-whole provision related to the early retirement of debt will impact EPS. This charge of approximately $40 million pre-tax or $26 million after-tax, and the early retirement of debt could affect the company's overall financial position.

Given the expected challenges in sustaining strong performance and the impact of the early retirement of debt on EPS and interest expense, an 'underweight' investment stance for the company may be prudent.
