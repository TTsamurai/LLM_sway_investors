Based on the recent earnings call transcript provided, I would recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company had a solid performance in the first quarter, with bookings, sales, and EPS exceeding expectations. The increase in both bookings and backlog, especially for international programs, indicates strong demand from a broad base of domestic and international customers. The company also raised its full-year outlook for net sales, while maintaining a strong balance sheet. The capital deployment strategy, including share buybacks and dividend increases, reflects the company's confidence in its financial position and future growth. Overall, the company's performance and outlook suggest a favorable investment opportunity.
