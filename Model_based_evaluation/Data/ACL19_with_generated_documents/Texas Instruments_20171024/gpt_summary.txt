. So our focus is on maximizing shareholder value through increasing free cash flow per share and investing in the business or returning excess cash to our owners. Our balance sheet remains strong with $3.44 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter, 76% of which was owned by the company's U.S. entities. Our total debt remains unchanged at $3.6 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 1.93%. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.57 billion to $3.87 billion and earnings per share in the range of $1.01 to $1.15, which includes an estimated $20 million discrete tax benefit. We continue to focus on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. Our general expectation is for revenue to pull through at about 70% to 75% over the long haul, and we expect to continue gaining share and have additional revenue fall through at these rates. Overall, our results continue to demonstrate our progress and we are confident in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners.
