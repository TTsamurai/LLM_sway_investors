. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our recent earnings conference call. In this summary report, I will provide an analysis of the key financial metrics discussed in the conference call transcript and adopt an 'underweight' investment stance based on the information presented.

In the second quarter of the fiscal year, the company reported better-than-expected results across all key financial metrics, including revenue, volume, margins, and EPS. Q2 revenues increased by 32.3% year-over-year, driven by strong Invisalign case shipments across all channels, particularly in the teen segment. The solid execution of the company's strategy and key investments continues to deliver strong growth across the board.

The Invisalign clear aligners and scanners are the company's two primary operating segments. In Q2, Invisalign case volume saw substantial growth in both North America and international markets. The company also introduced Invisalign Lite in North America, which saw significant uptake, especially among GP dentists. Additionally, the teen market showed strong growth with an increase in teen patients starting treatment with Invisalign clear aligners.

The company has also continued to invest in consumer marketing campaigns, with a specific focus on teenagers and their parents. These marketing efforts have contributed to significant growth in consumer demand, website traffic, and doctor locator searches. Furthermore, the company's iTero scanner business performed well, with revenues increasing by 36.7% year-over-year. The introduction of new software features for the iTero Element 1.5 has enhanced its capabilities and contributed to increased Invisalign case submissions using digital scans.

The company's partnership with SmileDirectClub (SDC) has also shown promising results, with strong shipments to this new channel and a significant increase in consumer marketing by SDC, which has positively impacted both SDC and Invisalign demand.

Looking ahead, the company remains confident in its ability to drive the industry forward and transform orthodontics from an outdated analog process to a fully digital system. However, while the second quarter results were strong, it is important to note that the long-term potential and growth prospects for the at-home, doctor-directed market, as well as the adoption cycle for new products and features, are still in the early stages.

Based on the information provided in the conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance towards the company. The rapid growth in the second quarter may not be sustainable, and there are potential challenges and uncertainties in the long-term outlook, including market penetration, product adoption, and consumer demand. Additionally, the company's extensive investments in consumer marketing and expansion markets may require time to yield significant returns.

In conclusion, while the company's financial performance in the second quarter was robust, a cautious approach is warranted in assessing its long-term growth potential and investments. Further analysis and monitoring of key operational and financial metrics are recommended before making significant investment decisions.
