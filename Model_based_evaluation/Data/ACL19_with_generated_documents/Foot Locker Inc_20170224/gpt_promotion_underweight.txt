Thank you for the detailed overview of the company's recent performance. While the achievements and strategic initiatives you outlined are indeed impressive, caution is warranted regarding future investment in the company. The recent underperformance of Kids Foot Locker, as well as the struggles in the European market with the Runners Point and Sidestep banners, raise concerns about the company's ability to sustain its current growth trajectory. Additionally, the reliance on specific brands such as Nike, adidas, and PUMA for strong sales raises questions about the company's resilience in the face of changing consumer preferences and competitive dynamics in the athletic retail industry. Furthermore, the company's heavy investment in digital capabilities and premium apparel may not fully offset potential weaknesses in core footwear sales. Given these factors, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company until there is greater clarity on its ability to navigate challenges and maintain sustainable growth. Thank you.
