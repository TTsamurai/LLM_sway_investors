Based on the extensive details provided in the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for Foot Locker, Inc. Here are the key financial metrics that support this recommendation:

1. Sales Performance: While the company has achieved strong sales performance in the core business, particularly in the male banners in North America, the reliance on a few key brands (Nike, adidas, and PUMA) for sales growth poses a potential risk. Moreover, challenges in the Kids Foot Locker banner and struggles in the German-based Runners Point and Sidestep banners indicate potential weaknesses in the overall sales performance.

2. Profitability: While profitability remained high in 2016, the growth in apparel penetration and profitability has been mixed. Additionally, the slowdown in sales growth in Europe and struggles in the Eastbay business point to potential profitability challenges in certain segments of the business.

3. Digital Business: While the digital business had a good year, there are concerns over the underperformance of Eastbay and the need for enhancements in the new ecommerce platform. This may impact overall sales and profitability in the digital segment.

4. Women's Business: While there have been improvements in the women's business, it's important to note that maintaining this growth may require sustained efforts and further investments.

Based on these financial metrics and the potential risks highlighted in the conference call transcript, it is advisable to maintain an 'underweight' investment stance for Foot Locker, Inc. until the company addresses the challenges and demonstrates sustainable growth across its key business segments.
