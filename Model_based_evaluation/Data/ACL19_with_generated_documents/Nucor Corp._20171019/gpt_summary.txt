Based on the recent earnings conference call transcripts, Nucor reported third quarter 2017 earnings of $0.83 per diluted share, representing a decrease compared to the second quarter of 2017 earnings of $1 per diluted share and the year-ago third quarter earnings of $0.95 per diluted share. However, the first nine months of 2017 earnings exceeded annual earnings achieved since 2008. Nucor's financial position remains strong, with total debt outstanding at $4.4 billion and a gross debt to capital ratio of 33% at the end of the third quarter. Cash and short-term investments totaled over $1.6 billion, with a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that remains undrawn. Capital spending for 2017 is estimated to be approximately $500 million, and depreciation and amortization is projected to be about $730 million. During the third quarter of 2017, Nucor repurchased 1,591,000 shares of its common stock at a cost of about $90 million. Nucor's capital allocation priorities are to invest for profitable long-term growth, pay cash dividends, and opportunistically repurchase its stock. The company has returned approximately $8.3 billion to shareholders via regular dividends, supplemental dividends, and share repurchases, representing about 39% of Nucor's cash from operations generated from 2004 to the just completed quarter.

In terms of market outlook, Nucor is encouraged by positive factors impacting its key end markets, including nonresidential construction, automotive, energy, heavy equipment, and agriculture. The company expects fourth quarter earnings to be similar to slightly decreased from the third quarter, excluding a tax benefit recognized in the third quarter. The raw materials segment's performance is expected to improve significantly, driven by more consistent direct reduced iron (DRI) production. The steel products segment is likely to benefit from margin improvement, while the steel mills segment may see some decline due to seasonality and weakness in plate. Nucor is also hopeful for the implementation of Section 232 measures, stating that the delays in implementation are resulting in a surge of illegally traded imports. The company is confident that President Trump will fulfill his commitments to the steel industry and hopes to see Section 232 measures implemented in the early part of next year.

Nucor feels confident about its availability and pricing of electrodes due to its long established contractual relationships with suppliers and utilization of DRI to reduce energy consumption and electrode usage. The company is also working on enhancing the reliability and environmental friendliness of its Louisiana DRI plant and expects to complete a study on potential repairs and improvements in the next couple of months. Additionally, Nucor is making advancements in producing grades that are used in large pipe and transmission lines at its facilities in Tuscaloosa and Hertford.

Overall, Nucor remains optimistic about the future and believes that its significant competitive advantages, adaptable business model, and proven strategies will allow the company to continue delivering profitable long-term growth and attractive returns to its shareholders.
