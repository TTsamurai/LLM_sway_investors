In summary, the third quarter earnings of Nucor were $0.83 per diluted share, representing a decrease compared to previous quarters but an increase compared to the same period in 2016. Nucor's disciplined strategy for profitable growth has resulted in strong earnings for the first nine months of 2017, exceeding annual earnings achieved every year since 2008. The company's financial position remains strong, with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion and cash and short-term investments totaling over $1.6 billion.

Nucor's capital allocation priorities include investing for long-term growth, paying cash dividends, and opportunistically repurchasing its stock. The company's confidence in its competitive advantages, adaptable business model, and proven strategies will continue to deliver profitable long-term growth and attractive returns to shareholders.

The company expects stable or improving conditions for its most important end markets, including nonresidential construction, automotive, energy, heavy equipment, and agriculture. Nucor's earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 are expected to be similar to slightly decreased from the third quarter, excluding a tax benefit recognized in the third quarter.

Nucor's focus on availability and pricing of electrodes, as well as its DRI usage, gives the company an advantage in terms of supply and consumption of electrodes. The company's development of grades at its facilities in Tuscaloosa and Hertford allows it to supply most of the plates for large pipe and transmission lines, addressing concerns about the U.S. industry's ability to produce all necessary products.

Nucor's Louisiana direct reduced iron ore (DRI) plant experienced an unplanned outage, but the company has successfully improved the quality of the product and reduced emissions with the new HYL technology. Nucor is taking a holistic approach to reengineering the process to improve reliability and minimize issues with emissions.

Looking forward, Nucor anticipates a decrease in imports and expects improvements in demand, particularly in infrastructure build and areas affected by recent natural disasters. The company remains confident in the implementation of the Section 232 tariffs and the commitment of President Trump to the steel industry.

As a financial analyst, based on the company's strong financial position, its focus on profitable growth, and the positive outlook for its end markets, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Nucor. The company's disciplined approach to capital allocation, its long-term earnings growth, and its potential for attractive returns to shareholders make Nucor an attractive investment opportunity.
