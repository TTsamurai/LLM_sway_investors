, so really some good news there and certainly a healthy pipeline as well. As it relates to underweight stance and outlook, I think there are a couple of reasons for that. First and foremost, we've seen some headwinds in the backlog, particularly in combat systems, and although the pipeline is strong, we may see some delay in conversion to revenue. Additionally, there are some foreign exchange impacts and potential margin dilution in combat systems due to the mix of programs. Aerospace, while showing strong performance, may face some challenges with the transition to the new accounting rules, and the shift in outlook for green deliveries. While the pipeline is strong, we see potential for delays in conversion to revenue. Marine group and IS&T also have strong pipelines, but we see potential for margin pressures and challenges in converting backlog to revenue. Overall, while the company has demonstrated good performance in the recent quarters and has provided a positive outlook, we see potential challenges and headwinds that may impact the company's future performance. So, our recommendation for an underweight stance is based on these insights and financial metrics derived from the recent earnings conference call transcript. We believe that the potential challenges and headwinds may overshadow the positive outlook, leading to a more cautious approach to investment in the company.
