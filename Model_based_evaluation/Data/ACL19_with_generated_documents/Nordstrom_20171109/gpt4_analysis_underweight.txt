### Investment Outlook Report: Underweight Stance on Nordstrom Inc. (JWN)

#### **Executive Summary**
Nordstrom Inc., a leading fashion retailer, has exhibited a mixed financial performance in Q3 and is facing several challenges as it heads into the crucial Q4 holiday season. Despite launching innovative customer engagement initiatives and showing resilience in digital sales areas, the company has faced setbacks including inventory mismanagement, a significant impact from hurricanes, and weakening comps in Nordstrom Rack brand. Therefore, we recommend an **‘underweight’** investment stance on Nordstrom stocks.

#### **Financial Performance Analysis**
- **Earnings Impact**: Q3 earnings were negatively impacted by approximately $0.04 per share due to hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. This led to store closures and extensive damage, particularly in Puerto Rico.
- **Sales Growth and Comps Decline**: While total sales have grown by 2%, comparable store sales—a key retail metric—decreased by 0.9%. This decline reflects deeper issues in store traffic and conversion rates.
- **Inventory Concerns**: Initially aggressive sales plans led to overstocking, thereby reducing inventory fluidity and impacting the ability to introduce new products. Although rectification steps have been taken, the effects were noticeable in Q3 performance.

#### **Strategic Initiatives and Challenges**
- **Digital and Omni-channel Investments**: Nordstrom's significant investments in digital realms, including Nordstrom.com and Nordstrom Rack online, indicate a strategic shift towards enhancing digital experiences and integrating online and offline operations. The growth in digital contribution is robust, with Nordstrom.com growing at a mid-teens rate post-adjustment for return impacts.
- **Innovative Concepts**: Initiatives like Nordstrom Local, expanded Reserve Online and Try In-Store services, and partnerships with emerging brands are positive steps towards personalizing customer experience. However, the financial benefits of these initiatives remain uncertain in terms of ROI and customer acquisition costs.
- **Operational Adjustments**: The adjustments to inventory and sales plans are expected to normalize the stock levels in Q4, but the execution and impact on holiday sales are yet to be seen.
- **Market Dynamics and Competition**: Nordstrom faces increasing competition from both traditional and pure online retailers, requiring it to stay ahead with innovative offerings and efficient service. The company's ability to enhance its value proposition through exciting merchandise and partnerships is crucial but remains under pressure due to past overestimations and planning misalignments.

#### **Outlook and Risks**
The current outlook for Nordstrom’s Q4 remains cautiously optimistic internally, with management focused on aligning inventory with market demands and enhancing customer service levels. However, several risks loom:
- **Consumer Spending Sensitivity**: Lingering effects of natural disasters on consumer spending in affected regions.
- **Inventory and Sales Misalignment**: While corrections are underway, any further misjudgment in demand could lead to decreased sales and additional markdowns.
- **Dependence on Holiday Season Performance**: A significant portion of retail earnings is generated in the Q4 holiday period. Failure to capitalize on this season could have severe financial implications.

#### **Recommendation**
Given these observations and looming uncertainties, particularly in operational execution and market competition, it is prudent to adopt an ‘underweight’ stance on Nordstrom. Investors should closely monitor Q4 performance and subsequent quarters for indications of successful execution of strategic initiatives and inventory management before reconsidering the investment stance.
