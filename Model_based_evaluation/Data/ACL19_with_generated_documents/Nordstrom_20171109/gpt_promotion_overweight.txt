Based on the recent earnings call, it is evident that Nordstrom has faced some challenges, particularly due to the impact of hurricanes and over-inventory issues. However, the company remains committed to improving its top-line results, providing good inventory flow, fashion-right merchandise, and the best value possible. Nordstrom has also been investing in new ways to engage with customers, such as the Nordstrom Local concept and Reserve Online and Try In-Store service, to drive increased customer engagement and market share.

Additionally, Nordstrom is focused on making holiday shopping faster and easier for customers, with initiatives such as Buy Online Pick up In-store, same-day delivery services, and 24-hour curbside pickup in major markets.

While the third quarter results showed some downturn, Nordstrom is taking steps to improve its execution and respond to the business in a more timely manner. The company believes it is well-positioned for the fourth quarter and is optimistic about the opportunities for improvement.

Overall, based on the company's commitment to addressing its challenges, investing in new customer engagement initiatives, and focusing on improving execution, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Nordstrom. Despite the challenges faced, the company's strategies and initiatives indicate a commitment to growth and improvement in the long term.
