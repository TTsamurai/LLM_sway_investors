### Analyst Commentary and Investment Stance: Underweight

**Reasoning**:
1. **Sales Growth Concerns**: Though total sales grew by 2%, the comparable store sales decline and the underperformance in the Nordstrom brand are worrying signs. The company faces challenges in driving store-level growth and customer traffic.
  
2. **Inventory Mismanagement**: Initial over-aggressive sales forecasts resulted in inventory excess, which impacted the ability to refresh offerings timely. While adjustments have been made, the effectiveness of these changes needs to be validated in the coming quarter.

3. **Operational Inefficiencies**: The need for significant adjustments in operations, as evidenced by the inventory and sales plan misalignments, suggests there may be deeper systemic issues within the company’s operational strategy.

4. **Competitive Concerns**: The downturn in Nordstrom Rack’s performance and the need for reactive strategic shifts indicate potential vulnerabilities in Nordstrom’s competitive positioning, especially in the off-price retail segment.

**Conclusion**:
Given the mixed financial results, operational challenges, and uncertain effectiveness of recent strategic adjustments, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended. This cautious approach is suggested until there is clear evidence of sustained improvement in sales growth, inventory management, and overall operational efficiency. Investors should monitor subsequent quarters closely for signs of successful implementation of strategic initiatives and improved financial metrics.
