Based on the recent earnings call, the company reported earnings per share of $0.67 for the third quarter, which was reduced by approximately $0.04 due to the impact of hurricanes Maria, Irma, and Harvey on their stores. The company also reported a total sales growth of 2% and a comp decrease of 0.9%, with lost sales from the hurricanes accounting for approximately $20 million. Additionally, the company acknowledged that their sales plan at the beginning of the year was too aggressive, resulting in over-inventoried stores and a lack of newness in their product offerings. This led to softer results in the third quarter. They have made significant adjustments to their receipt plans to bring their inventories in line for the fourth quarter.

The company also highlighted their focus on engaging with customers through initiatives such as Nordstrom Local, Reserve Online and Try In-Store service, and partnerships with fashion influencers. They emphasized their commitment to providing a differentiated selection of products and a personalized customer experience.

During the call, it was mentioned that the company's Nordstrom Rack business is approaching $5 billion in sales for the year, and their digital business, including Nordstrom.com and HauteLook, did $700 million last year and is the fastest growing business in the company's history, projected to reach $1 billion.

The company admitted that they were overcommitted to their sales plans earlier in the year, which impacted their ability to be fluid in the market and chase the business. They made aggressive changes to their planning to position themselves better for the fourth quarter.

In summary, based on the information provided in the earnings call, there are several red flags that should raise caution for potential investors. The company faced challenges due to the impact of natural disasters, over-inventoried stores, and aggressive sales planning. While they have made adjustments to address these issues, the results for the fourth quarter will be critical in determining the effectiveness of their strategies. Therefore, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company until there is more clarity on their performance in the upcoming quarter.
