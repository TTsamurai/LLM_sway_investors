Based on the recent earnings call, there are several compelling reasons to recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company's U.S. onshore business is experiencing tremendous drilling advancements in the Delaware and DJ Basins, leading to substantial cost efficiencies. The average drilling cost per lateral foot in these areas is down 20% to 30% compared to last year. The company is also incorporating new advances in data analytics and physics-based learning processes in their drilling operations, leading to predictive changes that improve performance. This has resulted in industry-leading wells, as shown by the results being generated across their acreage position. The company is also realizing significant improvements and efficiencies on the completion side, particularly in the Delaware Basin, leading to substantial reduction in completion time. Additionally, the company's midstream business is providing a significant operating advantage in the Delaware Basin. 

The company's performance improvements from enhanced completions in the DJ Basin have led to record volumes and a record oil mix of 53%. The company is also making progress with their Eastern Mediterranean assets, with sales volumes from Tamar benefiting from Israel's increasing shift to natural gas usage for power generation. The Leviathan project is progressing towards first gas by the end of 2019. Despite the impact of lower DJ vertical volumes, the company remains on track to deliver its original annual volume guidance. 

The company's efforts to incorporate more efficient practices and their ability to deliver the same volume for fewer wells online demonstrate their strong operational capabilities. The company's focus on maximizing capital efficiency and their ongoing contracting progress highlight their strategic approach to business. The company's commitment to safety, environmental protection, and the integrity of their operations is evident in their dedication to successful flow line integrity tests and the permanent abandonment of off pad flow lines.

Overall, the company's recent earnings call reflects a strong performance across their U.S. onshore and Eastern Mediterranean assets, as well as their commitment to efficiency, safety, and environmental responsibility. This positions the company as a compelling investment opportunity, warranting an 'overweight' investment stance.
