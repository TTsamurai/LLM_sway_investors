. With a 'positive' investment stance for Noble Energy, I would recommend an 'overweight' position based on the following financial metrics:

- Cost efficiencies in the U.S. onshore business, with a 20-30% decrease in drilling costs per lateral foot in the Delaware and DJ Basins, leading to improved performance and lower costs.
- Significantly improved efficiencies in completion processes, particularly in the Delaware Basin, reducing completion time on 10,000-foot Wolfcamp A wells by more than a week compared to the plan.
- Strong performance and encouraging results from industry-leading wells across the acreage position, including wells from the Wolfcamp A and B zones, as well as extended production history from the Wolfcamp C well, which is outpacing expectations.
- Progress in the Eagle Ford, with an average IP 30-rate of approximately 620 barrels of oil equivalent per day per 1,000 lateral feet and significant growth in the second quarter.
- Anticipated higher sales volumes from the Tamar asset, driven by Israel's increasing shift to natural gas usage for power generation and seasonal demand.
- Continued progress in the development of Leviathan towards first gas by the end of 2019, including the completion of drilling operations at Leviathan 5 and the anticipation of awarding a drilling and completion contract in the next couple of weeks.
- On track to deliver original annual volume guidance of 340,000 to 350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with expected significant growth from U.S. onshore assets, particularly in the fourth quarter.

Given these key financial metrics, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended as Noble Energy shows strong potential for performance and growth in the coming quarters.
