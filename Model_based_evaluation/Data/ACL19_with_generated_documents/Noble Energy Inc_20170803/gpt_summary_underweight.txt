 based on our current understanding. So that is kind of a longer-term test. It's not like we're going to drill a whole bunch of them out. It'll be kind of spaced out and just running evolutions like we normally do in our business. Yeah—we're going to continue to spend as much time as we can looking for those opportunities, just like we have around the DJ and like we do every day across the company, where we can bolt on small amounts of acreage and firm up larger positions. So we're going to continue to do that and take advantage of those opportunities when we see them. I'd say that—the challenge around there is making sure we've got drilling rights for longer laterals, which is always a challenge. But I would say a lot of these are located in an area where we've got good coverage. So, that's our ongoing work today. We're already in discussions with folks. We're swapping location areas for drilling rights as we speak, so that's a great opportunity to create something that we can use in future years. Dave, we're real old school, obviously, haven't we learned this a long time ago? But it's not like we got better rock or better foundation, or anything else. It's just better completion, better understanding of how to frac these horizontals in order to maximize recoveries. So, at the end of the day, it's making sure we're positioning the fracs where the oil actually is and in rocks that aren't being damaged along the way. And all that comes from a variety of tests that we've done, a lot of microseismic data, then a lot of science around stress shadowing, and all that. But ultimately, it's just putting the sand in the right location, and creating a highly conductive path back to the wellbore. And where you do that successfully in these rocks, it's amazing how they produce. But at the same time, you need to be able to track that frac and understand how far the oil's moving into the play, so you can determine accurately how much of the play is flowing back into the wellbore. So, that's a lot of the techniques that the company's developed over time, and it's not like we've advanced that science and understanding recently, but we've improved it a lot. And importantly, moving from verticals to horizontals allow us to hit it with many more wells, and keep the rocks producing as hard as possible for a long period of time. But at the end of the day, it's just putting sand in the right location in these rocks, and that's what we're focused on. Well, our 2017 production guidance is 345,000 to 355,000 barrels per day even with our zero expected liftings at Alba and EG in the third quarter and adjusted for the lower DJ vertical volumes I mentioned. We actually closed the acquisition of the San Juan assets last week. So, they're now in our numbers and actually in our production forecasts. We will have some downtime that we end the year as we swap systems over, but again, they have proved very complimentary to us and our production guidance. And remember, though, as well, when you look at these assets, their commodities and their positions have performed, we adjusted into that guidance per year today is significant despite the underlying production decline that we got. And that does take into account attack for the downtime that we've got from completing that integration here. But overall, when you look at these assets, their baseline performance increases the capital backing we now have for the U.S. onshore—where it's kind of producing the highest rates of return in the company, right—so we are putting money into what's the highest rate of return in the company we're going to focus on the other businesses, look for further opportunities there, for investments we are also talking about. But with that, some might come along—capital treatment, but it's enabled us to do this transaction, help us deal with all the assets, which puts us in really good shape as we go forward. I appreciate it. Thanks. I think you're seeing that reflected in the performance, and the fact that not only are we bringing on fewer wells, but the wells we are bringing on are outperforming the type curves enough to actually offset the vertical declines, right? So, that's a very good thing for us. I think it's just a reflection of the work we've done, the improved designs and completions and, again, the practice that our teams are getting from doing this smaller-scale pad development that turns into exposure area in connection with trading, us into potentially trading drill rights for drilling rights. And so I think that's really showing up now in the production. Great. Thank you, Sujit, for the color. And guys, this is David. Can you talk to us about the third-party access for gas and expand a little bit on your comments around the increased contractual demand that you're expecting from Israel and potentially the surrounding region? Thank you. Thank you, Katrina.
Summary:
The company's U.S. onshore business continues to see tremendous advancements in drilling efficiencies, which have led to a 20% to 30% reduction in drilling costs per lateral foot compared to the previous year. The company has been successful in driving down costs and minimizing non-productive time on the rig, delivering a better well for completion. They have also realized significant improvements and efficiencies in completing wells, particularly in the Delaware Basin. The company's midstream business provides a significant operating advantage, and they are quickly applying their expertise from the DJ Basin to coordinate development with centralized facilities. The company is also integrating activities across their entire Delaware position after acquiring Clayton Williams Energy, and they have been able to apply learnings to the Clayton Williams acreage.

The dominant theme in the DJ Basin is performance improvements from enhanced completions, which have led to record volumes in focus areas. The company anticipates an increase in oil production and continues to focus on optimizing capital efficiency. The company's Eastern Mediterranean assets have benefited from Israel's increasing shift to natural gas usage for power generation, and they continue to progress Leviathan towards first gas by the end of 2019.

Overall, the company remains on track to deliver their original annual volume guidance, with significant growth expected from their U.S. onshore assets. They are confident in their performance and are continuing to focus on maximizing opportunities for further growth and investment.
