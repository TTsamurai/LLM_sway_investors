**Noble Energy Conference Call Summary – Financial Metrics Focused**

**Key Highlights:**

1. **Drilling Cost Efficiency:**
   - Significant reductions in average drilling cost per lateral foot in the Delaware and DJ Basins, achieving a 20-30% decrease compared to the previous year.
   - Introduction of new techniques and technologies such as advanced data analytics and physics-based learning to further drive cost efficiencies.

2. **Operational Efficiencies:**
   - In the Delaware Basin, advancement in multi-well pad developments led to reduced cycle times and operational costs, surpassing than those of single-well completions. Notable example includes the use of continuous operations and zipper fracking.
   - Integration of midstream operations providing substantial operational advantages, especially with centralized facilities streamlining development and lowering costs.

3. **Production and Sales Volume:**
   - U.S. onshore assets expected to contribute significantly to volume growth, with a particular emphasis on oil, which is expected to increase approximately 40% from Q1 to Q4.
   - Eastern Mediterranean segment benefits from increased natural gas usage in Israel, anticipating higher sales volumes due to seasonal demand and governmental mandates.

4. **Well Performance and Development:**
   - Notably strong performance in the DJ Basin with record volumes and an advantageous oil mix. Enhanced completions drove performance improvements.
   - In the Eagle Ford, systematic development approaches continue, with recent wells performing well within projections.
   - Progression towards first gas by the end of 2019 on the Leviathan development, with major contracts nearing finalization.

5. **Capital Efficiency and Cost Management:**
   - Testing various completion designs to optimize capital efficiency, including alterations in stage spacing and use of local sand sources.
   - Reduction in investment concerning low production-rate vertical wells, emphasizing cost-effective operational strategies.

6. **Future Outlook and Guidance:**
   - Quarter trend excluding divestments shows 15% higher U.S. onshore oil volumes in Q2, with anticipations of a continuous increase into Q4.
   - Commitment to environmental safety and operational integrity with numerous flow line integrity tests completed.
   - Forecasted continued reduction in vertical production in the DJ Basin due to natural declines and selective investment strategies in workovers.

7. **Infrastructure Development:**
   - Completion of the Billy Miner central gathering facility contributing to operational efficiencies.
   - Plans for additional facilities to come online in H1 2018 to further increase oil gathering capacity.

8. **Risk Management and Safety Efforts:**
   - Extensive safety and environmental protection efforts following regulatory guidance, ensuring the safety and integrity of operations via substantial man-hour investments.

**Closing Remarks:**
The company remains robust in its operational execution and strategic initiatives, continuing to enhance technological integration while focusing heavily on cost management and productive efficiency. Noble Energy’s adjustment of plans and agile response to operational needs underscore their commitment to sustainable growth and operational excellence. The integration and performance of recent acquisitions such as that of Clayton Williams Energy play a crucial role in bolstering the company's projections for reduced costs and increased production efficiency. As we move towards year-end, the focus will remain on leveraging latest technologies, optimizing existing assets, and maintaining a strong commitment to safety and environmental standards.
