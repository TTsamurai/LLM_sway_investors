. Additionally, we continue to see tremendous drilling advancements in the Delaware and DJ Basins, driving substantial cost efficiencies. The average 2017 drilling cost per lateral foot in these areas is down 20% to 30% compared to last year, with plans to further improve drilling efficiencies and lower costs using new data analytics and physics-based learning processes in our drilling operations.

On the completion side, we have seen significant improvements and efficiencies in the Delaware Basin, particularly in multi-well pad developments, shaving days off planned cycle times compared to single-well completions. We continue to realize significant improvements and efficiencies on the completion side, particularly in the Delaware Basin. Continuous operations and zipper fracking have reduced completion time on the 10,000-foot Wolfcamp A wells on the Monroe pad. We are also utilizing midstream assets in the Delaware Basin, allowing for coordinating development with Noble Midstream-operated centralized facilities.

Since closing the Clayton Williams Energy acquisition, we have integrated activities across the entire Delaware position, including drilling the first 10,000-foot laterals on the position and completing three wells with Noble's standard high-intensity completion design. The results from the Wolfcamp A and B zones are encouraging, and we continue to evaluate the best completion designs to optimize capital efficiency.

In the DJ Basin, enhanced completions have led to record volumes in Wells Ranch and East Pony. Wells Ranch wells have shown production over 1,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day for more than 100 days.

We anticipate bringing on production 35 to 40 more wells in the Delaware and continue to see substantial growth in the Eagle Ford. Production in the Tamar field is expected to benefit from Israel's increasing shift to natural gas for power generation, with the government's mandate to increase natural gas usage in power generation to 80%.

We remain on track to deliver our original annual volume guidance despite expected liftings at Alba and EG in the third quarter and lower DJ vertical volumes. Our U.S. onshore assets continue to show significant growth, with oil expected to increase approximately 40% from the first quarter through the fourth quarter.

In summary, our U.S. onshore assets continue to deliver strong operational and financial performance, showcasing our commitment to driving down costs and maximizing efficiency in our drilling and completion operations. We remain optimistic about the continued growth and development of our assets in the U.S. onshore business.
