Based on the company's recent earnings conference call transcript, we can see that they continue to see significant advancements in their U.S. onshore business, especially in the Delaware and DJ Basins, resulting in substantial cost efficiencies. They have also seen significant improvements and efficiencies on the completion side, particularly in the Delaware Basin. Additionally, their midstream business is providing a significant operating advantage, particularly in the Delaware.

The company has also highlighted significant developments in their Eastern Mediterranean assets, particularly in the Leviathan project, which is progressing towards first gas by the end of 2019. The company continues to make significant progress in selling Tamar gas, with increasing demand in Israel for natural gas usage for power generation.

Based on the company's performance and outlook shared in the transcript, it appears that the future outlook for the company is quite positive, with strong volume growth and advances in operational efficiency. However, it is important to note that the company's overall strategic, financial, and operational goals should be considered when analyzing their performance and future outlook. Given the positive developments in the company's business operations, an 'underweight' investment stance may not be justified at this time. It would be prudent to conduct further analysis and closely monitor the company's performance before making any investment decisions.
