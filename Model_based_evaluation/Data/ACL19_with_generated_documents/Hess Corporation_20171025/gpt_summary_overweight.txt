. Thank you for your detailed summary of the recent earnings conference call transcript. This provides valuable insight into the financial metrics and future investment stance of the company.

Based on the information presented, it is clear that the company is making strategic asset sales to generate proceeds and reduce debt, providing financial flexibility to fund high-return investment opportunities in Guyana and the Bakken. The company is focused on improving returns on invested capital by divesting high-cost assets and reallocating capital to low-cost, cash-generative assets such as Guyana and the Bakken.

Key financial metrics such as operating costs, DD&A expenses, and effective tax rates have been provided, along with guidance for the fourth quarter and full year. These metrics demonstrate the company's efforts to drive down costs and improve efficiency.

Additionally, the company is implementing a cost reduction program to rationalize its fixed cost base and improve operational efficiency, which is expected to result in significant savings by 2019.

Overall, the strategic asset sales and focus on high-return investments, along with the cost reduction program, support a positive investment stance, and it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' position based on the company's financial outlook and strategic initiatives.
