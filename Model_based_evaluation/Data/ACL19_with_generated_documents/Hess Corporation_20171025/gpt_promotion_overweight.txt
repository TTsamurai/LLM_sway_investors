Based on the information provided in the recent earnings call transcript, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company is expected to complete asset sales, reduce debt, and evaluate plans to add up to two additional rigs in the Bakken during 2018. The proceeds from asset sales, in addition to the current cash position and free cash flows from the company's low-cost cash generative assets, provide financial flexibility to fund the growing world-class investment opportunity in Guyana.

It is important to note that the Equatorial Guinea and Norway asset sales will not incur any transaction taxes and the company has settled open tax matters with the taxing authorities for the tax years prior to the effective date. This provides potential for the release of $85 million in related tax reserves on the balance sheet. Additionally, the company's strong liquidity position and ability to drive down cash costs will contribute to superior returns compared to other outside opportunities.

The company's focus is on shifting and reallocating capital to investments with higher returns, such as Guyana and the Bakken. The company's new projects and developments are expected to improve F&D costs, and the potential for efficiencies could further benefit the company's cost reduction efforts.

The company's strategy includes a focus on driving down DD&A rates, cash costs, and generating free cash flow post the Guyana production, leading to improved return on capital employed. The company is confident in its ability to reduce costs by $150 million by 2019, with potential headcount reductions, vendor cost reductions, and operational cost reductions across the board.

In summary, the recent earnings call provides a positive outlook for the company's financial position, potential for increased returns, and strategic efforts to improve cost efficiency. Based on this information, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on the company.
