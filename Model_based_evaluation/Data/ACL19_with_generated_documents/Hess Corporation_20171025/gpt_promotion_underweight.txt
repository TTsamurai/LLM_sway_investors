Based on the recent earnings call, there are several points to consider when evaluating the company's investment potential. The company has announced asset sales and expects to receive significant proceeds from these transactions by the end of 2017. The use of these proceeds to reduce debt and potentially add up to two more rigs in the Bakken raises questions about the company's financial position and strategic direction.

The company's net loss in the third quarter of 2017 increased compared to the previous quarter, with an adjusted net loss of $324 million. This was partly due to a non-cash charge of $550 million after-tax for the sale of Norway, and an after-tax gain of $280 million associated with the sale of enhanced recovery assets in the Permian Basin.

The company's effective income tax rate for the E&P segment was a benefit of 18% in the third quarter of 2017, compared with a benefit of 8% in the second quarter, suggesting potential volatility in tax expenses.

Guidance for the fourth quarter includes an expectation of higher tax expenses due to the asset sales, while cash costs and DD&A expenses are projected to decrease. However, the company mentioned that they will be enacting cost-saving measures that could offset the reduction in expenses in the long term.

The company emphasized the potential for improved returns on invested capital from divesting high-cost assets and focusing on low-cost, cash-generative assets in the Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia, as well as the potential for high returns from investments in Guyana and the Bakken.

The company's plan to reduce debt and evaluate plans to add more rigs in the Bakken raises concerns about the allocation of funds and the potential risks of further investments.

Overall, the company's financial position and strategic direction may be uncertain, and the recent asset sales may not fully address these concerns. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended until there is more clarity on the company's plans and potential risks associated with their investments.
