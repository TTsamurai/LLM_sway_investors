**Executive Summary:**

We initiate coverage on Hess Corporation ("Hess") with an 'overweight' recommendation. Supported by recent earnings calls and extensive strategic asset reallocations, Hess presents a unique and timely investment opportunity. These activities position Hess for potentially higher returns, focused cash flow generation, and a fortified financial outlook. Our analysis delves into the company's promising ventures, notably in Guyana and the Bakken region, supported by robust operational results and sound asset dispositions.

**Key Investment Highlights:**

1. **Strategic Asset Sales:**
   Hess is on track to complete the sales of its interests in Equatorial Guinea, Norway, and is expecting finalization of Denmark sales in 2018. The transactions anticipate total proceeds of $3.25 billion, which are directed towards substantial debt reduction and funding growth ventures.

2. **Astute Capital Allocation:**
   Proceeds from asset disposals are being systematically reallocated to lower-cost, higher-return opportunities, primarily in Guyana and the Bakken formation. Initial deployment includes planning for two additional rigs in the Bakken region. These asset sales and deployments are expected to significantly improve the company's portfolio quality and return profile.

3. **Robust Operational Performance:** 
   Although recent results show a net loss, operational management has seen improvements with lower costs and elevated efficiencies. The Midstream segment portrayed a profit, showcasing improvements from enhanced operational focus.

4. **Financial Resilience:**
   With proceeds from asset divestitures, Hess is strategically strengthening its liquidity without resorting to further debt or equity markets. A robust current cash position, complemented by ongoing free cash flows notably from assets in the Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia, offers flexibility and supports a sound investment opportunity.

5. **Favorable Tax Positioning:**
   The transactions related to Norway and Equatorial Guinea are structured to be tax-efficient, which is anticipated to positively impact the financial results and cash flows.

6. **Long-term Growth in Guyana:**
   Investment in Guyana represents a world-class opportunity, expected to deliver high returns at low costs, potentially far surpassing global industry averages. The company's strategy is to leverage high-impact opportunities in Guyana to sustain and grow its earnings base.

7. **Enhanced Returns to Shareholders:**
   Despite the hold on dividends given current strategic moves, shareholders are poised to benefit from the potential capital appreciation driven by strategic reinvestments and superior asset optimization.

**Risks:**

- **Volatility in Global Oil Prices:** Sustained low oil prices could impact the projected returns, especially impacting high capital-intensive projects like those in Guyana.
- **Operational and Geopolitical Risks:** International operations carry inherent geopolitical and operational risks, including regulatory changes and operational disruptions.
- **Execution Risks:** The effectiveness of strategy execution, particularly relating to new rig additions and asset productivity, holds significant influence over expected performance.

**Conclusion:**

Hess Corporation is strategically setting a robust platform for sustainable growth and value creation. The asset restructuring is not only optimizing its portfolio but also reducing costs which are critical under current market conditions. The focus on high-return projects in Guyana, coupled with operational enhancements in existing assets, supports our 'overweight' investment stance. Current and potential investors are advised to capitalize on this growth-oriented opportunity, which is anticipated to yield substantial returns in the medium to long term.
