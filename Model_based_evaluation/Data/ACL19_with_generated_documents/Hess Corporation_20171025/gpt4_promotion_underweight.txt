**Underweight Investment Recommendation for Hess Corporation**

**Executive Summary:**
This report offers a cautious perspective on Hess Corporation based on its recent earnings call and performance metrics. The recommendation is to assign an 'underweight' investment stance toward Hess shares. This recommendation is grounded on several concerns about operational losses, uncertain future prospects in global operations, and significant dependence on asset sales for liquidity.

**1. Continued Financial Losses:**
Hess reported a net loss of $624 million in the third quarter of 2017, worsening from a net loss of $449 million in the previous quarter. Despite asset sales and operational adjustments, the company continues to post substantial losses. The adjusted net losses and reported after-tax losses in key segments highlight underlying vulnerabilities in Hess’s operational efficiency and profitability.

**2. Heavy Reliance on Asset Sales:**
The firm has planned or completed multiple asset sales amounting to billions, such as those in Equatorial Guinea, Norway, and the anticipated sale in Denmark. While these sales have provided significant short-term liquidity — enabling debt reduction and potential reinvestment — they also signal a shrinking operational footprint and a possible lack of sustainable profitability in existing ventures. This strategy raises concerns over long-term growth and operational stability.

**3. Uncertainties in Major Projects:**
Hess's future heavily relies on the successful execution of its Guyana and Bakken projects. However, there remains considerable uncertainty about the scale and viability of future phases in Guyana, as highlighted during the earnings call. The dependence on these large but uncertain projects presents significant risks to the company's stability and growth prospects in a challenging oil price environment.

**4. Operational and Geopolitical Challenges:**
The ongoing reductions in operational costs and expenses may not be sufficient to offset the broader challenges faced in global markets. Geopolitical tensions and regulatory scenarios, such as the maritime disputes mentioned, also add layers of risk to Hess’s international operations. These factors may influence operational certainty and affect long-term asset value.

**5. Competitive Landscape and Market Conditions:**
The global energy market is rapidly evolving with competitive renewable energy sources and changing regulatory landscapes regarding fossil fuels. Hess's current strategy and operational model may not be agile enough to cope with these fast-paced changes, risking obsolescence or reduced market share.

**Conclusion:**
Given the financial losses, reliance on asset sales for liquidity, uncertainties in pivotal projects, and broader operational challenges, it is recommended that investors maintain an 'underweight' stance on Hess Corporation. This recommendation will be re-evaluated following the next quarter’s financial results and updates on project developments in Guyana and the Bakken region. Investors should look for improved profitability, clearer project outcomes, and strategic adaptability in Hess’s operations before reconsidering their investment positions.
