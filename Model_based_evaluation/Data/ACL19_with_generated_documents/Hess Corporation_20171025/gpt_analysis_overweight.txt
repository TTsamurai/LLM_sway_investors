Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that the company is actively divesting high-cost assets in Equatorial Guinea and Norway, as well as planning to undertake asset sales in Denmark. These sales have resulted in total proceeds of $3.25 billion, which will be used to reduce debt by $500 million. This will provide the company with financial flexibility to fund its growing investment opportunity in Guyana and Bakken. The company also aims to maintain a strong liquidity position and may consider cash returns to shareholders in the future.

The company's financial metrics reveal that they reported a net loss in the third quarter of 2017, which includes an after-tax gain from the sale of enhanced recovery assets in the Permian Basin. Lower operating costs, expenses, and exploration expenses, combined with higher realized selling prices and sales volumes, improved results in the E&P segment. The Midstream segment also reported net income, and Corporate expenses decreased in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.

The company's cash flow from operating activities was $415 million in the third quarter, with changes in working capital reducing operating cash flows, and proceeds from the sale of assets totaling $604 million. The company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.48 billion and total liquidity of $6.8 billion, which will help to support its upcoming investments in Guyana and Bakken.

The company provided guidance for the fourth quarter, projecting E&P cash costs and DD&A rates to decrease, while net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment is expected to increase. Corporate expenses, interest expenses, and exploration expenses are also estimated to decrease in the fourth quarter and full year 2017. The company is focusing on driving down cash and DD&A costs to under $10 per barrel and improving returns on invested capital.

Overall, the divestment of high-cost assets and strategic investments in Guyana and Bakken are expected to improve the company's financial position and drive better returns on capital employed. These initiatives, combined with cost savings and efficient operations, indicate promising growth prospects for the company, supporting an 'overweight' investment stance.
