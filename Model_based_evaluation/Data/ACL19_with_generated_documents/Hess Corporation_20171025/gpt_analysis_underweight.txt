. So, it sounds like the company is focusing on divesting high-cost assets in order to free up capital and invest in higher return assets, such as Guyana and Bakken. They also plan to reduce debt and add up to two additional rigs in the Bakken, as well as evaluate cash returns to shareholders. The asset sales are expected to provide substantial financial flexibility without the need to access debt or equity markets. However, the company reported a net loss in the third quarter of 2017 and incurred various charges related to asset sales, which impacted their financial results. The company's future outlook includes projections for cash costs, DD&A, tax rates, and operating expenses. It's clear that they are focused on improving the returns on invested capital and driving down cash costs and DD&A through their portfolio reallocation strategy. They also plan to reduce overall costs through a significant cost reduction program and restructuring of their fixed cost base. Given the current state of their financials and the potential impact of the asset sales and investments in high-return assets, it may be prudent to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company at this time.
