Key Financial Metrics:

1. Asset Sales and Proceeds:
   - Total proceeds from recently announced asset sales are $3.25 billion from transactions in Equatorial Guinea, Norway, and Permian EOR. Denmark sales process expected to be completed in 2018.

2. Cash and Liquidity:
   - Excluding midstream, ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.48 billion, total liquidity of $6.8 billion, and debt of $6.16 billion.

3. Operating Activities and Costs:
   - Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $415 million. Changes in working capital reduced operating cash flows by $327 million.
   - E&P cash costs projected to be in the range of $13.50 to $14.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter of 2017.

4. Exploration and Production:
   - Adjusted net loss in the E&P segment was $238 million in the third quarter of 2017, compared to a net loss of $354 million in the second quarter.
   - Expected improvement in E&P unit operating costs to be in the range of $36 to $38 per barrel in the fourth quarter and $38.50 to $40.50 per barrel for the full year.

These key financial metrics indicate the strategic use of proceeds from asset sales, focus on reducing costs and expenses, and planning for future investments in high-return assets. The company's ability to generate free cash flows, reduce debt, and manage liquidity position provides financial flexibility to fund growing investment opportunities. The expected improvements in performance metrics such as cash costs, DD&A, and net income demonstrate the company's efforts to enhance returns on invested capital and drive down break-even costs. The planned cost reduction program and transition to low-cost, cash-generative assets are expected to support long-term financial stability and growth.

In conclusion, the company's focused approach on portfolio optimization, cost reduction, and strategic investments is aimed at driving sustainable financial performance and capturing value in an extended $50 oil price environment. We will continue to monitor the company's financial performance and look forward to further updates on the progress of key investment opportunities in Guyana and Bakken.
