The company's recent earnings conference call transcript reveals several key financial metrics that indicate a net loss in the third quarter of 2017, with adjusted net loss at $324 million. The proceeds from asset sales, along with the company's current cash position and free cash flows from low-cost cash generative assets in the Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia, provide financial flexibility to fund the growing investment opportunity in Guyana without needing to access the debt or equity markets.

The company does not intend to pursue any M&A activity and is focused on reshaping its portfolio to provide superior returns compared to other outside opportunities. It has managed to settle open tax matters with the Equatorial Guinea taxing authorities, releasing $85 million in related tax reserves from the balance sheet.

In terms of financial performance, E&P had an adjusted net loss of $238 million in the third quarter of 2017, while the Midstream segment reported net income of $22 million. Corporate and interest expenses were at $108 million in the third quarter.

The company reported net cash provided by operating activities of $415 million, with changes in working capital reducing operating cash flows by $327 million. Additions to property, plant, and equipment were at $513 million. Proceeds from the sale of assets were $604 million, with net repayments of debt at $19 million and dividends paid at $91 million.

On the guidance front, the company projects E&P cash costs of $13.50 to $14.50 per barrel of oil equivalent in the fourth quarter of 2017, and total E&P unit operating costs are projected to be in the range of $36 to $38 per barrel.

Looking ahead, the company expects to benefit from the sale of high-cost assets, such as Norway and Equatorial Guinea, and reinvest the proceeds into low-cost, high-return assets such as Guyana and the Bakken. The company aims to drive down its cash costs and DD&A rates below $10, while also focusing on cost reduction measures to achieve savings of $150 million by 2019.

In summation, with the company's current financial position and outlook for future investment opportunities, it is advised to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance. The company's net loss and ongoing cost reduction efforts indicate a level of financial risk that may impact future earnings potential. Additionally, the lack of visibility into Exxon's plans for phase 2 and 3 of the Liza development in Guyana may pose further uncertainties for shareholders. Therefore, exercising caution in investment decisions in light of the company's financial metrics is recommended.
