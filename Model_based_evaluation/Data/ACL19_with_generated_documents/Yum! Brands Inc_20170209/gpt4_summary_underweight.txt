Based on the provided transcript from Yum! Brands' earnings conference call, the detailed summary of the key financial metrics, with an underweight investment stance, can be articulated as follows:

1. **Spinoff of China Business**: The spinoff of the China business concluded in 2016. While designed to focus management's efforts and reduce operational complexity, the move places Yum! Brands in a position where they are highly dependent on the performance of their remaining segments. Amidst notable strategic realignments, the prudence of this decision remains under review concerning its long-term value creation.

2. **Franchise Ownership Increase**: Yum! Brands aims to increase its franchise mix to at least 98% by the end of 2018. This transformation will lead to a notable reduction in the number of stores owned â€” shrinking to less than 1,000, alongside a decrease in capital expenditures to approximately $100 million. While these moves promise reduced volatility and potentially improved cash flow, they also expose Yum! to risks associated with reduced direct control over operational practices and potentially, brand image.

3. **Financial Performance**: The company reported a core operating profit increase of 27% for the quarter and 13% for the year, which exceeded expectations. While these figures suggest operational efficiency, investors are cautioned to consider whether such growth rates are sustainable in the absence of the China business and amid significant restructuring.

4. **Segment Performance**:
   - **KFC**: Showed healthy performance with global system sales growing 7% in 2016. Growth was fuelled by both same-store sales and expansion. However, in the highly competitive fast-food sector, maintaining this momentum could be challenging.
   - **Pizza Hut**: Faced a mixed outcome with a mere 2% growth in system sales, influenced by limited same-store sales improvement and expansion. Pizza Hut U.S. notably is under turnaround, reflecting underperformance and lagging market share capture.
   - **Taco Bell**: Consistently solid, showing system sales growth of 6%, driven by expansion and moderate same-store sales growth. 

5. **Investor Returns**: Yum! returned $6.2 billion to shareholders in 2016 following the spinoff. While attractive in the short term, the sustainability of such returns is contingent upon the successful execution of its aggressive franchising plan and turnaround strategies, especially in the Pizza Hut U.S. segment.

6. **Future Outlook and Growth Strategies**: The company is optimistic, targeting 7% annual system sales growth beyond 2019, focusing on enhancing franchise capabilities and digital transformation. However, the execution risk tied to these targets in the dynamic fast-food market could impact projected growth trajectories.

In conclusion, while Yum! Brands shows areas of strong performance, particularly in KFC and Taco Bell segments, the ongoing challenges with Pizza Hut U.S., coupled with risks tied to the aggressive transformation and franchising strategy, suggest a cautious approach. An 'underweight' stance is recommended until clearer signs of sustainable operation and strategic clarity, especially post-China spinoff, are evident. This stance also reflects concerns regarding market volatility and execution risks that may impact targeted goals.
