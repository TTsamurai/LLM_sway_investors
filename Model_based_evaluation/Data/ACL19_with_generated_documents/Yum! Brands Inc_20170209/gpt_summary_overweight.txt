Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that Yum! Brands is undergoing a transformation aimed at accelerating growth, reducing volatility, and increasing capital returns to shareholders. The key financial metrics that support an 'overweight' investment stance are as follows:

1. Core operating profit increased 27% in the last quarter and 13% for the entire year, exceeding previous guidance and long-term targets. This indicates strong financial performance and growth potential.

2. KFC, a consistent global performer, achieved total system sales growth of 7% in 2016, driven by 3% same-store sales growth and 3% net new unit growth. The brand's focus on convenience, digital initiatives, and global expansion is expected to contribute to sustainable growth.

3. Pizza Hut, despite facing challenges in the U.S., demonstrated growth in net new unit development internationally and improved same-store sales in markets like Thailand, Korea, and Malaysia. With the implementation of a repeatable model and strategic initiatives, the brand aims to accelerate top-line and unit growth.

4. Taco Bell delivered solid system sales growth of 6% in 2016, with strong same-store sales performance and record international development. The brand's high/low value strategy, innovative marketing, and expansion into new markets present growth opportunities.

Overall, Yum! Brands has reaffirmed its long-term targets and is poised for sustainable growth. The company's strategic initiatives, focus on key growth drivers, and strong financial performance support an 'overweight' investment stance for potential investors.
