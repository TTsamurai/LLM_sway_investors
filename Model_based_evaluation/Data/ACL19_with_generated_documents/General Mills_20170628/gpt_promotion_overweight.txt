Based on the recent earnings call transcript, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company has seen a decline in net sales for the fiscal year '17, but with a focus on cost savings, margin improvement, and investments in key areas such as media, expansion in China and Europe, and e-commerce capabilities, there is potential for improvement. The company's projections for fiscal '18 include a steady improvement in organic net sales and cost savings initiatives that will more than offset input cost inflation. Additionally, the company aims to increase media investment and target a net reduction of average diluted shares outstanding. The company expects to convert more than 95% of their adjusted after-tax earnings to free cash flow in fiscal '18. Despite the challenges faced in the previous year, there is strong potential for growth and improvement in the coming year. Therefore, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended based on the company's solid plans for fiscal '18 and the potential for future growth.
