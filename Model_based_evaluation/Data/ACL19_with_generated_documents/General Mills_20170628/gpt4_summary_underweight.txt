- **EPS**: Adjusted diluted EPS expected to rise between 1% and 2% in constant currency.

**6. Summary and Recommendation:**
The persistent challenges in key financial metrics such as net sales decline, the impact of strategic divestitures, and volume declines across several segments present significant risks despite the cost management efforts. Given the ongoing market and operational struggles despite strategic realignments, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended.

This cautious stance is aligned with observable trends of declining sales and operatic profits, coupled with an uncertain recovery trajectory in the near term. Continued diligence and re-evaluation will be necessary as fiscal '18 progresses and as management's strategic initiatives begin to take effect.
