 based on our fiscal ‘18 plans. Our investment in media, expanding our brands to new markets, and building capabilities like e-commerce and process transformation will be significant contributors to our profit improvement next year. However, these investments will also result in a drag on earnings, particularly in the early part of the year. 

Considering the company's financial performance, the 6% decrease in net sales for the full year fiscal ‘17, the decline in operating profit, and the decrease in earnings per share are concerning. The decline in organic net sales across various segments, as well as the challenges in the U.S. industry trends, further indicate a potential downside for the company's financial performance moving forward.

Additionally, the significant increase in core working capital and the decrease in operating cash flow are also indicators of financial strain. The increased capital investments and the decrease in free cash flow present further concerns regarding the company's ability to generate sustainable earnings and maintain healthy financial metrics.

In conclusion, the company's financial performance and the outlook for fiscal ‘18 indicate a potential downside, leading to an 'underweight' investment stance. The anticipated decline in organic net sales, the impact of investments on earnings, and the challenges in industry trends all point towards a cautious approach to investing in the company.
