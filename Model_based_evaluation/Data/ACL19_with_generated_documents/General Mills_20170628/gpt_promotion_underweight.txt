Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. Despite some positive aspects such as constant currency adjusted diluted EPS increasing 14% versus a year ago, there are several concerning factors. Net sales were down 3% on a reported and organic basis in the fourth quarter, and down 6% as reported and 4% on an organic basis for the full year. Additionally, there were declines in organic net sales for the North America retail segment, as well as some segments in Europe and Australia.

The company also expects organic net sales to decline between 1% and 2% in fiscal ‘18, as well as an increase in media investment for the year. Although the company plans to expand its adjusted operating profit margin, there are concerns about the impact of investments on COGS and SG&A.

Overall, while there are some positive aspects to the company's recent performance, the decline in net sales and the cautious outlook for fiscal ‘18 warrant a skeptical perspective on the company's stock.
