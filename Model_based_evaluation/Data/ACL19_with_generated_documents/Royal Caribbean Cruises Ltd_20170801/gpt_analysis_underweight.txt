 at hand. So I think it's something to keep in mind. And, yes, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Jason. And thank you, everyone. So based on the insights and financial metrics derived from the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that the company's outlook for the future is very positive, with strong industry-wide demand, particularly in new markets such as China.

However, as a financial analyst, it is important to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the following reasons:

1. Cautionary tone: While the company has experienced an exceptionally good year, it is important to note that next year may not be as good. The company's management has highlighted the difficulty of achieving particularly strong comparables for 2018.

2. Headwinds: The company is facing uncertainties such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and potential challenges in maintaining load factors at record levels. It is important to consider these headwinds when projecting future financial performance.

3. External factors: The company's success is also subject to external factors such as travel restrictions to certain destinations, which may impact future bookings and revenue.

4. Market saturation: The trend towards experiences over material possessions may lead to market saturation in the future, especially as competitors enhance their digital capabilities and expand their reach.

5. Long-term sustainability: While the company has been successful in enhancing guest satisfaction and on-board revenue, it is important to assess the long-term sustainability of these initiatives and the impact on future financial performance.

In conclusion, while the company has experienced exceptional growth and success, it is important to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance due to potential uncertainties and challenges in the future. This stance will allow for a more cautious approach to investment decisions and a thorough assessment of the company's ability to sustain its current growth trajectory.
