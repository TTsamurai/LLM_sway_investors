 that we're developing within Project Excalibur. So, I just don't want to forget that there is the less visible, less monetizable aspect, but still very important for our operations. So, with that, I'll turn it over to Jason. Jason? Thank you, Finley. And thank you to everyone for your insightful comments. It's clear from the earnings call transcript that the company is experiencing exceptional growth and success in the current year, with positive outlook for the next year as well. The company's strategic initiatives, such as the DOUBLE-DOUBLE program and the price integrity program, have proven to be successful in driving revenue growth and strengthening market position. Additionally, the deployment of new ships and investment in digital tools under Project Excalibur are positioning the company for long-term success and relevance in the market. The company's expansion in China and focus on environmental stewardship demonstrate its commitment to continuing growth and sustainability. Furthermore, management's acknowledgment of potential headwinds and cautious approach to future outlook indicates a responsible and proactive approach to risk management. In light of these positive developments and financial metrics, I recommend adopting an 'overweight' investment stance for the company. Thank you.
