 being developed through Project Excalibur. As for the other things you mentioned, I think that was covered somewhat earlier. Nonetheless, we're definitely moderating the growth in load factors, and that's exactly what we should be doing. And I think that's reflected in the overall strategy that we've been pursuing, trying to always drive the price of the cruises harder. There are a number of, we'll call them headwinds, sometimes it's the extent of China. And Laura, as those groups accumulate on these ships, do we think we can make a deposit tomorrow to the bottom line? I'm always amazed at how that worksâ€”it doesn't typically work that way. What happens is we book a show in the theatre, probably 18 months from today, that's when we really know that. What we do know, of course, is that the owners of these 10,000 plus people in groups will typically spend more money at least in the casino and at least in the bars. If we continue to produce 10% returns each year, and then we reinvest those returns at 10%, it gets us there real close. On some of our leases, we're actually exceeding those numbers. But overall, I'd say part of it's a macro view, which is consistent, part of it is a lease or another product that we develop internally, and that represents just how our reservations are doing and how wonderfully we're doing. And I think that's consistent. Given historically, how rarely everything goes perfectly in every circumstance, what's remarkable is how this looks across the board. Now, I hope that we're capable of continuing this. I hope that we have a collision, to share to potential guests. And I would say that's a possibility. My job is to worry about that and to plan for that. And then if it's our unique value, we should be able to try to do that. I mean basically, if we do it, we will be able to exceed our DOUBLE-DOUBLE performance this year. And that's exceptional for an extremely good year. Now trying to predict over the longer-term future, we're hopeful that those are the fundamental macro forces that will allow us to do that. But as you well know, since we've never made that, we shy away from making predictions about our numbers. And we enjoy being in the business of exceeding expectations and not having as much visibility on the other side. I think your summary was good. I think that's the essential point that Mike was trying to make. What it's really all about is how much fun Royal Caribbean's staff is having in exceeding our DOUBLE-DOUBLE expectations. And I think they're actually doing that. And I, obviously, hope that that means going forward, right through 2018. And I'd say that's consistent with my expectations. So, as he says, with two parts of what we've said, I mean the cautionary part is that it's been an incredibly good year, and those extraordinarily good conditions that we've seen in 2017 will moderate going into next year. But at the same time, there are so many other things that we've been doing that look even better than that, which goes back to that comment about bringing profit down to the bottom line and about the quality of the operation. So overall, I think a very good year. Thank you, everyone, for your hard work and consistent efforts. We've made exceptional progress across the board. And Jason, I think you ought to take us into questions and discussions now, unless there's anything you'd like to add. Thank you. Thank you, Robin, for your optimistic summary of the earnings conference call. The key financial metrics are as follows:

1. Earnings Forecast: Exceeding the high end of the original range of expectations.
2. Revenue Growth: Industry-wide demand and positive forces contributing to higher onboard revenue figures.
3. Load Factor: Expecting to achieve a record load factor this year, leading to positive bottom line impact despite slightly higher operating costs per lower berth.
4. Deployment of New Ships: Quantum Ultra sailing in China in 2019 to capture the digitally-focused market and maintain leadership position.
5. Digital Tools for Marketing: Project Excalibur to enhance data analytics, marketing, product development, and consumer experience on 15% of the fleet within five months and over half the fleet by the end of next year.
6. Positive Impact of Weaker Dollar: Balancing headwinds and tailwinds, weaker dollar viewed as positive for the company overall.
7. Sustainability Efforts: Long-term partnership with the World Wildlife Fund to achieve specific and measurable targets related to environmental stewardship.
8. Continuous Improvement: Focus on positioning Royal Caribbean for the future, multi-year direction to be announced.
9. Cautionary Tone for 2018: Although 2017 is exceptionally good, cautious outlook for 2018 due to difficult comparables and potential headwinds.

We believe that based on the positive financial metrics highlighted in the earnings conference call, Royal Caribbean presents a strong investment opportunity. Therefore, we adopt an 'overweight' investment stance on Royal Caribbean. Thank you.
