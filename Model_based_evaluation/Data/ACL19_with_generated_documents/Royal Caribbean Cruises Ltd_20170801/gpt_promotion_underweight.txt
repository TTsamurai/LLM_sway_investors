 that we are employing with as well. And it's something that's really an investment in the long-term future and the long-term success of the company. So, I think that's an important point to make in addition to what Jason said about the guest-facing activities that we're focusing on. Thank you, Assia, for your question. It's definitely a positive for us, and we're looking forward to continuing to leverage these digital tools to improve all aspects of our operations. And thank you all for joining us today. I think the cautious perspective is warranted, given the potential challenges and headwinds faced by the company in the coming year. Based on the discussion from the earnings call, I would recommend an 'underweight' investment stance for the company, as the outlook for 2018 may not meet the high expectations set by the exceptional performance in 2017. Thank you.
