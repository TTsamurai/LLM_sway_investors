In our latest earnings call, we evidenced compelling performance and strategic progression that underscores a robust investment opportunity in our company. We recommend an 'overweight' investment stance, grounded in the following key highlights and forward-looking strategies:

**1. Robust Revenue Growth:** We reported consolidated revenue of $2.458 billion for the quarter, marking a 6.7% increase year-over-year. This growth is particularly notable in the context of the macroeconomic challenges and is a testament to our resilient business model and sound operational execution.

**2. Strong Organic Growth in Core Segments:** Our North American operations witnessed a 5.5% revenue growth, with organic revenue growth at 2.8%. In Europe, revenue growth reached 7.9%, with organic growth at 4.1% on a reported basis and even more impressive, 7.1% on a same-day basis, pointing to robust underlying business dynamics.

**3. Strategic Acquisitions and Expansions:** The period saw fruitful expansions with the acquisition of the PGW aftermarket glass business significantly contributing to growth. Additionally, we opened 13 new branches in Europe, enhancing our network and customer reach. This aligns with our strategy to deepen market penetration and diversify revenue streams.

**4. Improved Profitability and Efficient Operations:** Income from continuing operations improved to $151 million, up 9.5% with refined buying algorithms and operational enhancements boosting gross margins by 40 basis points. These figures illustrate our capability to enhance shareholder value consistently.

**5. Strong Outlook and Guidance Update:** The revised guidance anticipates organic growth for parts and services to be between 4% and 5.25%, with adjusted diluted EPS expected to increase. The strategic initiatives in our pipeline are projected to sustain and accelerate this growth trajectory.

**6. Effective Capital Allocation:** Our strategic acquisitions are complemented by prudent financial management, as evidenced by our robust capital deployment and cash flow optimization. This ensures sustained growth and profitability while maintaining financial health.

**7. Advancements in Specialized Segments:** Our Specialty segment reported a 5.9% organic growth, benefiting significantly from trends in the RV market. The addition of a new 450,000 square foot Specialty Parts Distribution Center in California is set to further enhance capabilities and drive growth in this segment.

**8. Continued Global Expansion:** The ongoing investments in branch expansion, particularly in Europe, facilitate closer customer interactions and improved service delivery, setting the stage for increased market share and enhanced competitive advantage.

This strong performance across various parameters not only exemplifies robust current health but also aligns with strategic moves poised to drive future growth. The outlined advancements and strategic investments in technology, infrastructure, and market expansion justify our recommendation of an 'overweight' investment stance, presenting a promising opportunity for sustained growth and profitability.

We invite investors to capitalize on this opportunity, supported by our consistent performance, strategic market expansions, and robust financial health.
