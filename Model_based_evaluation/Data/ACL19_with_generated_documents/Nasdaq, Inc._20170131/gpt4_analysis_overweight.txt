**Executive Summary:**
Nasdaq, under the new leadership of its recently appointed CEO, presents a robust investment opportunity with a forward-looking strategy poised for growth and expansion. The organization has built a solid foundation and has strategically placed itself as a frontrunner in global capital markets and technology solutions. The new corporate structure, innovative technological advancements, and strong 2016 financial performance underpin our "overweight" investment stance. 

**Leadership Transition and Future Orientation:**
The transition of leadership to the new CEO seems promising, as his vision aligns with Nasdaq's historic strengths yet pushes forward on technological and strategic fronts. The CEO's commitment to maintaining organizational focus on shareholder returns and client-centric service enhancement assures continuity and growth potential.

**Financial Performance Insights:**
Nasdaq reported record net revenues of $2.3 billion in 2016, with non-trading segments contributing significantly. The noteworthy organic growth in Market Technology and Corporate Services segments, alongside an increase in non-GAAP EPS by 9%, underscores the company's financial health and operational efficiency.

**Technological Innovations and Market Strategy:**
Nasdaq's introduction of the Nasdaq Financial Framework (NFF) and further advances in blockchain and cloud capabilities highlight its thrust on technology. The NFF is set to significantly contribute to future order intakes and revenue, suggesting potential market expansion and increased client acquisitions.

**Segmental Realignment and Growth Prospects:**
The reorganization of the Listing Services and Corporate Solutions businesses into the singular Corporate Services segment promises improved transparency and client engagement. Similarly, independent reporting of the Market Technology segment is anticipated to attract investor attention due to its distinct growth trajectory and strategic importance.

**Performance of Non-Trading Segments:**
The consistently strong performance in non-trading segments not only diversifies Nasdaq’s revenue streams but also stabilizes earnings, marked by a 4% organic growth in 2016. Continued enhancements in products and services, particularly in the Corporate Solutions and IR Insights platforms, are likely to propel further growth.

**Geopolitical and Economic Factors:**
Despite uncertainties in the geopolitical landscape and financial regulations, Nasdaq's global reach and innovative service offerings are well-positioned to adapt and thrive. The company's proactive approach in navigating regulatory changes and potential macroeconomic impacts could fortify its market position.

**Investment Considerations:**
Based on the comprehensive analysis, the following points favor an "overweight" stance on Nasdaq:
1. Strong leadership and successful execution of strategic initiatives.
2. Robust financial performance with promising revenue and EPS growth.
3. Commitment to technological innovation and market leadership in financial infrastructure.

The blend of technological innovation, segmental growth, and strong corporate governance places Nasdaq in a favorable position for sustained growth and shareholder value enhancement in the coming years.
