 for your question, Greg. On the cost savings front, we have made significant progress in our cost reduction and revenue enhancement program. We have achieved $50 million in incremental annual benefits in 2017, and we are on track to hit our $400 million annual savings target by 2020. This is largely driven by our efforts to standardize and improve sourcing and reliability. We have also merged our Europe and Asia strategic business units which will drive significant savings. These initiatives put us on track to achieve our growth target of 8% to 10% in all key financial metrics through 2020. Our construction program is also a major contributor to our cash flow and earnings growth over the next four years. We have 3.4 gigawatts under construction, and we expect it to come online through 2019. We have also made significant progress on our projects in Chile, Indiana, India, and Panama. Additionally, our focus on battery-based energy storage and renewable energy in Mexico and Brazil is expected to contribute to our growth. We have also announced the pending acquisition of sPower, which will add 500 megawatts to 1 gigawatt of renewable contracted power annually with attractive low double-digit IRR. Furthermore, our efforts to reshape our portfolio by repositioning towards businesses that are less carbon-intensive and have long-term US dollar-denominated contracts have been successful. We have divested our non-core assets in Kazakhstan and Ohio, and we continue to pursue additional asset sales to further reshape our portfolio. Overall, we are confident in our ability to deliver attractive growth to our shareholders through 2020 and beyond, and we believe that our attractive total return proposition will be better reflected in our share price as we continue to make progress on our strategic objectives and guidance. Thank you for your questions.
