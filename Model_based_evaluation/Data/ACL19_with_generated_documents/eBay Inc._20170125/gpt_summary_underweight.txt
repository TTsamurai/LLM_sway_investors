The company's capital allocation policy focuses on long-term value creation, growth, profitability, acquisitions, and optimizing financial flexibility.

The company is considering realigning its legal structure, which may impact international entities, and has implemented a new hedging program to reduce the volatility of revenue from foreign exchange.

Underweight Investment Stance:

Based on the Q4 performance and guidance for 2017, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended. Despite revenue and GMV growth, factors such as declining operating margin, impact of a stronger US dollar, and potential legal structure realignment may pose financial risks. Additionally, the company's focus on disciplined marketing investments and potential acquisition in the face of macroeconomic uncertainties further support an underweight stance.
