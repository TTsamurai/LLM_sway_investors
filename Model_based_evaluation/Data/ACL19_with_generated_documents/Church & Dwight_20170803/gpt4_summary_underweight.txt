### Investment Stance: Underweight
- **Rationale:**
  - The company is experiencing downward pressure on EPS and margins, attributed to significant promotional outlays and increased SG&A spending.
  - Revenue growth appears modest and heavily reliant on promotional activities that can erode profitability.
  - International segment performance though strong, cannot wholly counterbalance domestic weaknesses.
  - Future EPS growth relies on dramatic reductions in promotional spend and operational cost improvements, both of which present considerable execution risk.
  
- **Recommendations:**
  - Investors should approach with caution due to potential volatility from market share fights and increased promotional activities indicating aggressive competitive pressures.
  - Monitor closely for improved efficiency in SG&A and marketing spend which could signal recovery and better investment attractiveness.
