Thank you for providing the transcripts. Based on the specified areas of focus, here's a detailed summary report focusing on key financial metrics from the recent earnings conference call:

### Earnings and Revenue Performance
- **EPS**: Adjusted EPS for Q2 came in at $0.41 per share, a 4.7% decrease from $0.43 in 2016 primarily due to a $0.12 per share charge related to a UK pension settlement. However, EPS exceeded the $0.37 outlook due to better margins in international and SPD segments, tax benefits, higher sales, and reduced SG&A expenses.
- **Revenue**: Reported revenues rose by 2.3% to $898 million. Organic sales grew by 1.8%, at the high end of the 1% to 2% guidance range, driven by international consumer business and SPD division.

### Segment Performance
- **Consumer Domestic**: Organic sales were flat influenced by couponing and promotional investments. Notable product performances included growth in ARM & HAMMER and OXICLEAN products, offset by declines in XTRA detergent and TROJAN condoms. Full-year organic sales growth forecast is approximately 2%.
- **International Business**: Organic growth was impressive at 7.4%, with strong performances noted in various regions including Mexico and Australia driven by BATISTE, FEMFRESH, and ARM & HAMMER products. Full-year expected growth is about 7%.
- **Specialty Products Division (SPD)**: Organic sales increased by 9.4% due to higher volumes in the animal productivity business, with an updated full-year growth expectation raised from 2% to 3% to around 6%.

### Margins and Profitability
- **Gross Margin**: Adjusted gross margin was 45.7% in Q2, down 80 basis points from the previous year mainly due to higher promotional levels which led to a drag of 180 basis points, despite productivity improvements and better international margins.
- **SG&A Expenses**: SG&A as a percent of net sales was 17.4%, a significant increase primarily due to the UK pension settlement charges. On an adjusted basis, SG&A was 13% of sales, up 20 basis points primarily due to increased amortization from acquisitions.
- **Operating Profit**: Adjusted operating margin was 18.1%, a reduction of 190 basis points compared to the previous year, largely due to shifted marketing investments and higher promotional spending.

### Cash Flow and Capital Outlook
- **Cash Flow**: Net cash generated for the first half was approximately $250 million, a decrease of $47 million from the previous year mainly due to changes in working capital.
- **Capital Expenditures**: Expected CapEx for the full year is about $45 million, with a free cash flow forecast of approximately $605 million, representing more than 120% free cash flow conversion.

### Future Outlook
- **Q3 Projections**: Expected organic sales growth of 3.5%, with the consumer domestic business growing at about 3%. Q3 EPS is anticipated at $0.46 per share, a 2% decrease year-over-year due to costs related to new product launches and promotional spending.
