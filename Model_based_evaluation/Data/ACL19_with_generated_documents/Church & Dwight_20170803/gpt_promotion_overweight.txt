As detailed in the recent earnings call, the company has demonstrated a strong performance in the second quarter, with adjusted EPS of $0.41 per share, exceeding the outlook of $0.37. Despite a 4.7% decrease from the previous year, this was largely due to better margins in international and Specialty Products division, as well as higher sales and lower SG&A spending. 

Reported revenues were up 2.3% to $898 million, with organic sales growth at the high end of the 1% to 2% range. The international organic growth was especially impressive at 7.4%, while the Specialty Products division saw a significant increase of 9.4%.

It is worth noting that the company has maintained its expectations for organic sales growth of 3% for the full year, with a gross margin improvement guidance of 40 bps year-over-year. The marketing as a percentage of revenue is expected to be around 12%, consistent with prior years, and the operating margin is expected to expand by 30 basis points.

Additionally, the company expects no net impact from the Water Pik acquisition and anticipates achieving 8.5% adjusted EPS growth or $1.92 per share.

Overall, the company's strong performance and positive outlook for the rest of the year make it a compelling investment opportunity. We recommend an 'overweight' investment stance based on the promising financial indicators and growth prospects detailed in the recent earnings call.
