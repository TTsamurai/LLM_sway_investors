Based on the conference call transcript, it is clear that the company's financial metrics are not performing as well as expected. The EPS for the second quarter was lower than the prior year, and the organic sales growth was lower than anticipated. Gross margin declined, primarily due to increased promotional levels and higher marketing expenses. The operating margin also decreased, largely due to the shift in marketing and higher promotional spending. Additionally, there was a decrease in net cash generated, primarily due to working capital, including deferred incentive comp and higher inventories. 

Looking ahead, the company expects organic sales growth to be only 3% for the full year, and marketing expenses to remain high at approximately 12% of sales. Furthermore, the company anticipates a 2% decrease in earnings per share for the third quarter, reflecting higher marketing expenses and consumer promotional spending. 

Considering these financial metrics and the company's outlook, it is recommended to maintain an 'underweight' investment stance.
