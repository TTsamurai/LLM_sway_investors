Based on the information provided in the recent earnings call, I would recommend an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. The second quarter adjusted EPS was lower than the previous year, and the organic sales growth for the Consumer Domestic business was flat. Additionally, the company experienced a 180 basis point drag on gross margin due to higher promotional levels, which resulted in a decrease in operating margin. Marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue hit a recent high of 14.6%, and the company expects marketing to be significantly higher year-over-year in the third quarter to support innovation. Overall, the company is expecting a 2% decrease in earnings per share in the third quarter, driven by higher marketing and consumer promotional spending. While the company expects strong earnings growth in Q4, it is important to note that the second half of 2017 will benefit from easier comps, and the company is maintaining its expectations for organic sales growth of 3%. Additionally, the company expects a 400 basis point drag in couponing for the full year, due to higher promotional spending. Therefore, given the cautious outlook for earnings and the significant promotional spending, I would recommend an 'underweight' investment stance for the company.
