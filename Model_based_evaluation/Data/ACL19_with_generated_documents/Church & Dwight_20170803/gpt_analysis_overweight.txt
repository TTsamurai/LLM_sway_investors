Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that the company has experienced a slight decrease in EPS and a 2.3% increase in reported revenues. The organic sales growth for the company's international business has been strong at 7.4%, and the Specialty Products division saw a significant organic sales increase of 9.4%.

The company's adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 45.7%, which was a decrease of 80 basis points from the previous year. This decrease was attributed to higher promotional levels and increased marketing spending. Marketing as a percentage of revenue also hit a recent high of 14.6%, indicating the company's focus on supporting innovation and new product launches.

Despite the decrease in EPS and gross margin, the company is maintaining its expectations for organic sales growth of 3%, gross margin improvement, and operating margin expansion for the full year. Additionally, the company expects strong earnings growth in Q4, as heavy coupons around new product trial peels off, and marketing goes back to normal levels.

The company generated approximately $250 million of net cash for the first half, representing a $47 million decrease from the prior year, largely due to working capital. However, the company expects approximately $605 million of free cash flow for the full year, representing an excess of 120% free cash flow conversion.

Overall, the company's international and Specialty Products divisions are performing well, and the company is maintaining its outlook for organic sales growth and other financial metrics. Based on these insights and financial metrics, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for the company, as it demonstrates strong potential for growth and profitability.
