### Summary Report: Earnings Conference Call Q1 2017 - SCANA Corporation

#### Key Financial Metrics Review

**Earnings Per Share (EPS):**
- Q1 2017 EPS stood at $1.19, experiencing a decrease from $1.23 in Q1 2016.
- The decrease is mainly attributed to notably milder weather conditions, adversely impacting electric margins by $0.24 per share, intensified by a comparison with a lesser $0.05 per share impact in Q1 2016. This marks a negative $0.19 per share impact year-over-year.

**Revenue Drivers:**
- Incremental Base Load Review Act rate increases and customer growth drove increased electric margins.
- Higher gas margins were noted due to customer growth and rate hikes at SCE&G and PSNC.
- However, gains were offset by rising costs associated with depreciation and property taxes related to Capital Expenditures (CapEx).

**Operational and Maintenance (O&M) impact**:
- Positive variances seen in O&M and other income were negated by the increased CapEx-related items.

#### Business Line Performance:

**SCE&G:**
- Earnings declined in comparison to Q1 2016 primarily due to the significantly milder weather, partially balanced by enhanced electric margins from continued financing cost recovery and rising gas margins resulting from rate increases and customer expansion.

**PSNC:**
- Reported earnings growth, primarily driven by customer growth and rate hikes.

**SCANA Energy:**
- Earnings dipped due to significantly milder weather conditions compared to Q1 2016.

#### Economic and Regional Employment Trends:

- The company announced investment plans intended to inject approximately $200 million, likely to create over 1,700 jobs in the Carolinas.
- South Carolina recorded a 4.4% unemployment rate with a marked increase in employable individuals signifying strong economic growth.
- North Carolina and Georgia showcased stable unemployment rates.

#### Customer and Electric Sales Growth:

- Customer growth remains strong across regulated businesses with SCE&Gâ€™s electric business demonstrating a 1.6% year-over-year rise.
- Gas businesses in South Carolina and North Carolina exhibited a customer addition rate of 2.8% and 2.6%, respectively.
- Weather-normalized total retail sales for electricity remained relatively consistent over a 12-month period, aligning with plans.

#### Regulatory Measures and Financial Forecast:

- The regulated rate base stood approximately at $11 billion, dominated majorly (86%) by the electric business.
- Allowed and earned Return on Equity (ROE) for various branches highlighted no necessity for non-BLRA related base rate hikes.
- Forecasted Capital Expenditures (CapEx) and revised financial planning due to ongoing reviews of the new nuclear project suggested significant financial commitments and strategic assessments ahead.

#### Investment Stance: Underweight

Given the overall negative impact of external factors such as weather, coupled with higher operational costs offsetting gains from rate increases and customer growth, an underweight stance is recommended. Additionally, uncertainties surrounding the new nuclear project contribute to this cautious outlook, meriting close monitoring of forthcoming financial adjustments and regulatory developments. The consistent need for CapEx to support infrastructure growth also implies potential strains on future earnings capability, raising concerns over sustained profitability.

This stance aligns with a risk-aware approach considering current challenges and prospective obligations that may affect the company's financial health adversely.
