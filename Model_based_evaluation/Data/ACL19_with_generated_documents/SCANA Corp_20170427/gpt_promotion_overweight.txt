Based on the company's recent earnings call, there are several compelling factors to consider for an 'overweight' investment stance in SCANA Corporation. The company experienced a decrease in earnings in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter in 2016, primarily due to abnormal weather. However, the positive variances in O&M and other income offset some of the impact. Additionally, customer growth and rate increases at SCE&G and PSNC contributed to increased electric and gas margins.

The company's service territories in North and South Carolina continue to see strong economic growth, with announced plans to invest approximately $200 million and create over 1,700 jobs. This economic growth has contributed to strong customer growth in the region.

SCANA Corporation's regulated rate base of approximately $11 billion is predominantly related to the electric business, with SCE&G's base electric business earning a return of 10.25% on equity. The company continues to meet its goal of earning a return of 9% or higher, mitigating the need for non-BLRA related base rate increases.

Despite the challenges faced by the new nuclear project, the company remains focused on determining the most prudent path forward and is committed to providing timely updates. The company's long-term GAAP adjusted weather normalized annual growth guidance targets a 4% to 6% earnings growth over 3 to 5 years.

Overall, SCANA Corporation's strong customer growth, stable economic environment, and commitment to prudently managing its regulated businesses make it a compelling investment opportunity. With a focus on providing timely information and updates to stakeholders, the company remains dedicated to operating its businesses in a safe, reliable, and efficient manner.
