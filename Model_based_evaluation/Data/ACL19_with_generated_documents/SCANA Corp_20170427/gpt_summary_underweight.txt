Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance. While the company reported earnings of $1.19 per share in the first quarter of 2017, this represented a decrease from the same period in 2016. The primary factors contributing to this decrease were a result of significantly milder weather, which impacted electric margins and resulted in a negative $0.19 per share impact on earnings quarter-over-quarter.

Furthermore, the company's new nuclear business is currently under evaluation for the most prudent path forward, which adds additional uncertainty to the investment outlook. The company's CapEx forecast also reflects ongoing review of the new nuclear schedule and cost estimates, indicating potential risks and costs associated with the project.

Additionally, while the company has position itself to earn a return on equity of 9% or higher for its base electric business, the uncertain outcome of the new nuclear project, as well as ongoing evaluations and discussions, may result in a less favorable investment outlook for the company. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended until further clarity and stability are achieved in the company's financial metrics.
