Based on the conference call transcripts, the company reported earnings of $1.19 per share in the first quarter of 2017, which was a decrease from $1.23 per share in the same quarter of 2016. This decrease was primarily attributed to abnormal weather, which negatively impacted electric margins by $0.24 per share. However, the company experienced increased gas margins due to customer growth and rate increases at SCE&G and PSNC. The company also reported increased customer growth in the region, with SCE&Gâ€™s electric business adding customers at a rate of 1.6% year-over-year.

The company reaffirmed its 2017 GAAP adjusted weather normalized earnings guidance range of $4.15 to $4.35 per share and the internal target of $4.25 per share. Additionally, the company continues to focus on delivering 4% to 6% earnings growth over the next 3 to 5 years.
