**Investment Summary Report on Earnings Conference Call - Overweight Stance**

**Company:** SCANA Corporation

**Conference Call Date:** First Quarter 2017 Results

---

**1. Earnings Overview:**
- **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** Q1 2017 reported EPS was $1.19, down from $1.23 in Q1 2016. This slight decline was attributed to much milder weather compared to the previous year, impacting electric margins despite increased base rates and customer growth. Specifically, abnormal weather reduced EPS by $0.24 in Q1 2017.
  
**2. Key Financial Performance Analysis:**
- **Revenue Drivers:**
  - **Electric Margins:** Gained from Base Load Review Act rate increases and customer expansion.
  - **Gas Margins:** Grew due to customer expansion and rate hikes at SCE&G and PSNC.
- **Expense Management:** Positives from O&M and other income were offset by CapEx-related increases (depreciation, property taxes).

**3. Business Segment Performance:**
- **SCE&G:** Earnings decline due to mild weather, partly offset by recovery of financing costs through BLRA.
- **PSNC:** Earnings growth driven by customer growth and rate increases.
- **SCANA Energy:** Decrease attributed to milder weather.

**4. Economic and Job Growth Impact:**
- SCANA’s investments led to substantial job creation in the Carolinas, with 1,700 jobs planned through $200M investments. South Carolina showcases strong economic indicators with a low unemployment rate of 4.4% and workforce growth.

**5. Customer and Sales Growth:**
- **Customer Growth:** Consistent increase across electric and gas sectors in South Carolina and North Carolina.
- **Sales:** Weather-normalized sales remained flat year-over-year, aligning with expectations despite abnormal weather conditions.

**6. Regulatory and Financial Framework:**
- **Regulated Rate Base:** ~$11 billion predominantly from the electric business.
- **Return on Equity (ROE):** Healthy ROE across segments, maintaining or exceeding allowed figures (9%-11%). SCE&G Gas’s earned ROE fell below the allowed threshold, prompting a forthcoming rate adjustment. 

**7. Capital Expenditure and Financing:**
- **CapEx Forecasts:** Stable across the coming years, tailored primarily around the ongoing nuclear projects.
- **Financing Strategy:** Detailed plans for mitigating costs via tax deductions and strategic debt/equity issuances.

**8. Future Earnings Guidance:**

- **Long-term Growth:** Targeting 4%-6% EPS growth over the next 3-5 years based on 2016’s adjusted EPS.

**9. Strategic Outlook and Management Commentary:**
- Management remains focused on navigating the challenges from the new nuclear project, aiming to make informed decisions benefiting all stakeholders. The ongoing evaluations will influence upcoming financial and operational strategies, with an emphasis on maintaining strong returns and business stability.

**Investment Recommendation: Overweight**
Given SCANA’s solid regulatory environment, consistent customer and revenue growth, and strategic handling of operational challenges, we maintain an overweight investment stance. The company is well-positioned to navigate through temporary setbacks with its robust financial management and strategic capital allocation. The continued regional economic growth and strategic rate adjustments will bolster profitability and shareholder value in the long run.
