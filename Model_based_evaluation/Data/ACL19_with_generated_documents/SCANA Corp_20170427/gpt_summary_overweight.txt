Based on the transcript from the recent earnings conference call, it is evident that SCANA Corporation's financial performance in the first quarter of 2017 was impacted by various factors such as increased electric margins, gas margins, customer growth, and rate increases, which were offset by significantly milder weather. Key financial metrics have been discussed in the following areas:

1. Earnings Per Share: Earnings in the first quarter of 2017 were $1.19 per share compared to $1.23 per share in the same quarter of 2016, with a negative $0.19 per share impact quarter-over-quarter due to abnormal weather.

2. Customer Growth and Electric Sales: The company saw strong customer growth rates across its regulated businesses, with the electric business adding customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.6% and gas businesses in South Carolina and North Carolina adding customers at rates of 2.8% and 2.6%, respectively. Additionally, the company's actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers were relatively flat on a 12-month ended basis, consistent with planned expectations.

3. Regulatory Rate Base and Returns: Approximately 86% of the regulated rate base, which is approximately $11 billion, is related to the electric business. The company's base electric business is allowed a 10.25% return on equity, and the regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina have allowed returns on equity of 9.7% and 10.25%, respectively.

4. Capital Expenditure (CapEx) Forecast: The company's CapEx forecast reflects projected spending through 2019 and does not include any revisions from ongoing review of the new nuclear schedule and cost estimates.

5. Earnings Guidance: The company reaffirmed its 2017 GAAP adjusted weather normalized earnings guidance range of $4.15 to $4.35 per share and its internal target of $4.25 per share. The long-term GAAP adjusted weather normalized annual growth guidance target also remains unchanged at 4% to 6% earnings growth over 3 years to 5 years.

Overall, SCANA Corporation's performance in the first quarter of 2017 and future outlook demonstrate strong customer growth, stable regulatory rate base and returns, and a reaffirmation of earnings guidance. Given these factors, an 'overweight' investment stance may be considered for SCANA Corporation. However, it is crucial to keep an eye on the ongoing evaluation of the new nuclear project, as the decision could have significant implications for the company's financial performance and outlook.
