Based on the recent earnings call of International Paper, it is clear that the company is facing several challenges that will impact their earnings in the near future. The company reported lower year-over-year earnings due to price erosion and weaker mix across many of their businesses. Additionally, they have faced several non-repeating items that have impacted their performance, such as the Riegelwood fluff pulp conversion, Hurricane Matthew, and a significant non-cash LIFO inventory reevaluation associated with their October containerboard increase implementation. 

The company also highlighted rising input costs, primarily OCC and energy, as a significant challenge that will impact their future earnings. They expect input costs to increase by $180 million to $200 million in 2017, which is a significant headwind for the company. 

Furthermore, the company has faced a major setback with the Pensacola mills digester incident, which will incur major costs in the first quarter and beyond. The total impact of this incident is expected to be in excess of $50 million, and while the company has insurance to cover a significant portion of the costs, the timing of the insurance recovery will be uneven and there will likely be some lag associated with getting claims covered.

In light of these challenges and setbacks, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on International Paper. Their recent earnings call and the issues they are facing suggest that their performance may be hindered in the near future. It would be prudent to approach investment in this company with caution and skepticism.
