Dear Team,

I have prepared a detailed summary report on the recent earnings conference call transcripts on key financial metrics.

The call primarily focused on the earnings impact for International Paper in the year 2016 compared to 2015. The key financial metrics discussed were:

1. Operating EPS: A $0.70 unfavorable swing was reported for 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to price erosion and weaker mix across various businesses. Volume showed improvement, but earnings were impacted by several factors including Riegelwood fluff pulp conversion, Hurricane Matthew, and non-cash LIFO inventory reevaluation.

2. Industrial Packaging: A significant portion of the presentation delved into the industrial packaging segment, where the price increase in domestic containerboard and U.S. box led to higher prices and improved volume. However, input costs, especially OCC, had a substantial impact on earnings.

3. Global Cellulose Fibers: The recently combined business segment of Global Cellulose Fibers was discussed, with a focus on the potential for growth and synergies, as well as the impact of Riegelwood conversion and ramp-up.

4. Outlook and Impact of Pensacola Mills Incident: The call also covered the outlook for the first quarter of 2017, including the benefits of the price increase and the impact of the Pensacola Mills digester incident, which is estimated to have a total financial impact in excess of $50 million.

5. Key Financial Metrics: The report also included the company's planning assumptions for 2017, including CapEx, depreciation, interest expense, effective tax rate, and escalating input costs.

Overall, the call reflected a challenging year for International Paper, with a focus on mitigating the impact of various external factors such as input costs, price erosion, and the Pensacola Mills incident. The outlook for 2017 remains cautious, with a focus on cost management and potential growth opportunities in the Global Cellulose Fibers segment.

Best,
