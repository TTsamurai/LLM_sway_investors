Based on the company's recent earnings call, there are several factors that give a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company:

1. The adjusted core sales declined for the Water segment and only grew 1% for the Electrical segment in the second quarter, indicating a potential weakness in the company's core business.

2. The impact of the completion of the sale of the Valves & Controls business resulted in higher interest expense and a modest increase in share count, which may have a negative effect on the company's financials.

3. The company's concern about absorbing higher material inflation due to competitive pricing pressure in the industry, which may impact margins and profitability.

4. The uncertain impact of incremental redundant corporate costs in the second half as the company prepares to spin off its Electrical business next year, which could lead to increased overhead and reduced profitability.

5. The fact that the timing of the pool season affected sales in the Aquatic & Environmental Systems business, with the full benefit expected in 2018, suggests a potential lack of immediate growth opportunities.

6. The decline in the Thermal segment's core sales by 12% as a result of completed projects from 2016 raises questions about the future growth and stability of this business segment.

Considering these factors, it is recommended to take an "underweight" investment stance on the company. It appears that the company may face challenges in achieving its long-term growth and value creation objectives, and there are uncertainties surrounding the impact of the planned separation of the Water and Electrical businesses. It is important for investors to closely monitor the company's performance in the upcoming quarters and evaluate whether the management's strategies can effectively address the challenges mentioned during the earnings call.
