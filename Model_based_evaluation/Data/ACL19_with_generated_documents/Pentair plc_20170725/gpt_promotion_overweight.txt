Based on the recent earnings call, Pentair has shown strong performance in the second quarter, with sales in line with guidance and segment income and adjusted EPS exceeding expectations. The completion of the sale of the Valves & Controls business has significantly improved the company's balance sheet. The company has tightened its full year adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $3.50 per share, which is the midpoint of its prior guidance.

Despite higher than planned interest expense and a modest increase in share count, Pentair achieved 14% growth in adjusted EPS, exceeding the high end of guidance by $0.01. Free cash flow of $289 million during the quarter was in line with normal seasonality following cash usage in the first quarter.

In the Water segment, although there was a core sales decline of 1%, the segment income grew 5% and return on sales expanded by 120 basis points. The Aquatic & Environmental Systems business saw a core sales growth of 1%, leading to a first half core sales growth of 7%. The Precision Spray business also demonstrated healthy growth.

In the Electrical segment, adjusted core sales grew 1%, with an industrial business growing mid single digits for the second consecutive quarter. Despite a decline in the Thermal business, Pentair expects it to exit 2017 in a strong position.

Furthermore, Pentair has announced the planned separation of its Water and Electrical businesses into two standalone companies, with a dedicated project management office driving work streams for the spin-off. This move is expected to create industry-leading pure play companies with attractive long-term growth prospects.

Overall, Pentair's strong performance, focus on driving higher differentiated growth, and planned separation into two standalone companies make the company an attractive investment opportunity. Based on the company's recent earnings call, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Pentair.
