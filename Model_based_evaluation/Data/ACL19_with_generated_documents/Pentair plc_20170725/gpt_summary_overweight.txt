Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, Pentair has achieved strong financial performance in the second quarter, exceeding sales, segment income, and adjusted EPS expectations. The sale of the Valves & Controls business has significantly improved the company's balance sheet, with a tightened full-year adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $3.50 per share, representing the midpoint of the prior guidance.

Key financial metrics indicate a 6% growth in segment income, a 170 basis point expansion in operating margins, and a 14% growth in adjusted EPS to $1. Notably, the Water segment delivered a 5% growth in segment income, and the Electrical segment achieved a 1% growth in segment income.

Despite challenges such as higher than planned interest expense, share count increase, and higher material inflation, Pentair has demonstrated strong performance and margin expansion, positioning the company for continued growth. Additionally, the planned spin-off of the Electrical business is expected to further strengthen the company's position in the market.

The company's strong balance sheet, improving top line, and continued margin expansion indicate promising prospects for the Water and Electrical businesses as they move towards the end of 2017. The outlook for both segments is positive, with expectations of long-term growth and value creation.

As a financial analyst, I recommend adopting an 'overweight' investment stance on Pentair, considering its strong financial performance, promising outlook, and the upcoming spin-off of the Electrical business. The company's ability to navigate challenges and deliver consistent growth makes it an attractive investment opportunity.
