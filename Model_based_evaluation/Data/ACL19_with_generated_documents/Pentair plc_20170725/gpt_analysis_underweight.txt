Summary:
- The company's second quarter performance exceeded expectations, with sales in line with guidance and segment income and adjusted EPS slightly exceeding the high end of the range.
- The sale of the Valves & Controls business significantly improved the balance sheet, but the close of the sale was later than the initial timeline, resulting in higher than planned interest expense in the first half.
- The company has tightened its full year adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $3.50 per share, with expectations of continued momentum into the second half of the year.
- The company will incur some incremental redundant corporate costs in the second half as it prepares to spin off its Electrical business next year.
- Adjusted core sales declined 1% in the quarter, but were up 1% for the first half. Segment income grew 6% and operating margins expanded 170 basis points.
- The Water and Electrical segments both faced some challenges, including softness in global diesel, muted spending in the beer industry, and continued weakness in the engineered pump businesses.
- The company expects to complete the spin-off of its Electrical business in the second quarter of 2018 and has organized a project management office to drive the process.
- Ongoing challenges include higher material inflation and price recovery, as well as balancing price increases with industry competition.
- The company is confident in the long-term prospects of both businesses and aims to drive higher differentiated growth with focused execution.

Based on the insights and financial metrics from the earnings call transcript, an 'underweight' investment stance may be recommended due to the challenges faced in core sales, ongoing inflation and price recovery issues, and the anticipated headwinds related to the spin-off of the Electrical business. Additionally, uncertainty regarding the capital structure of both companies and potential overlapping costs during the separation process may impact future performance. It is important to closely monitor how the company addresses these challenges and manages the transition to two standalone businesses before considering an overweight investment stance.
