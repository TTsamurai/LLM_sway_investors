Based on the transcripts from the recent earnings conference call, there are several key financial metrics that can be analyzed. Some key financial metrics and highlights from the call include:

1. Sales and Segment Income: The second quarter performance came in slightly out of expectations, with sales being in line with guidance and segment income and adjusted EPS slightly exceeding the high end of the range. The completed sale of the Valves & Controls business significantly improved the balance sheet.

2. Adjusted EPS Guidance: The company has tightened its full-year adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $3.50 per share, which is the midpoint of its prior guidance. This tightening includes some incremental redundant corporate costs in the second half as the company prepares to spin off its Electrical business next year.

3. Operating Performance: Adjusted core sales declined 1% in the quarter, but they were up 1% for the first half. Segment income grew 6% and operating margins expanded by 170 basis points, with both segments delivering margin expansion greater than 100 basis points.

4. Water Segment Performance: The Water segment delivered an adjusted core sales decline of 1%. Segment income grew 5%, and return on sales expanded by 120 basis points. The Aquatic & Environmental Systems business saw a core sales growth of 1%, yielding first-half core sales growth of 7%.

5. Electrical Segment Performance: Adjusted core sales grew 1% in the Electrical segment. Segment income grew 1%, and return on sales expanded by 140 basis points. The Commercial business remained strong, but there was continued softness in the Thermal business, which is facing a nearly $100 million top-line headwind in 2017.

6. Planned Separation: The company has approved a plan to spin off its Electrical business, which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018. There are ongoing discussions and planning for the capital structure of both companies, but no specific information is available at this time.

7. Pricing and Inflation: The company is facing headwinds related to pricing and inflation, with concerns about the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and increased competition in pricing across the different channels the company participates in.

Overall, the company remains optimistic about the prospects for both its Water and Electrical businesses, with a focus on long-term growth and value creation. The financial outlook for the remainder of 2017 includes mitigating headwinds related to pricing and inflation and addressing capital structure considerations for the planned separation of the Electrical business.
