The recent earnings call for Pinnacle West highlighted several key points that demonstrate the company's strong performance and future potential. The company's Palo Verde nuclear generating station had another record year and the company's fleet performed well in 2016, reaching 32.2 billion kilowatt hours of carbon-free electricity. The company also achieved the safest year with the fewest reportable injuries in its history, which is a strong indicator of management's ability to lead the organization. Additionally, the company made significant progress on regulatory initiatives, including the approval of a new net metering formula and a decision to consider DG solar customers as a separate class for rate making purposes.

In terms of capital investments, the company plans to spend more than 3.4 billion in capital over the next three years, focusing on modernizing the distribution grid, investing in flexible generation, and advancing customer experience. The company is also committed to upgrading its generation portfolio with flexible gas generation and installing environmental control technology at the Four Corners Power Plant.

The company's participation in the Western Energy Imbalanced Market has already produced $6 million in savings for customers in the fourth quarter of 2016, with continued savings expected throughout 2017.

Overall, the company remains focused on creating value through its core business and delivering on its financial and operational commitments. With a clear plan and a strong leadership team in place, the company is well-positioned for 2017 and the long-term.

Given the strong performance and future potential of Pinnacle West, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company's commitment to sustainability, regulatory progress, and capital investments make it an attractive investment opportunity with strong growth prospects.
