Based on the recent earnings call, it is clear that Pinnacle West had a productive year in 2016, with positive highlights in their nuclear power production, safety records, regulatory progress, and capital investments. The company also emphasized their commitment to modernizing the grid, investing in flexible generation, and advancing customer experience. However, given the uncertainty surrounding the rate review and potential impact of tax reform on their business, as well as the retirement of the Navajo Generating Station and the existing shortfall in resource supply, it is advisable to take a cautious stance on investing in Pinnacle West. The company's future may face challenges in managing their regulatory and financial outlook, making an 'underweight' investment stance the prudent recommendation.
