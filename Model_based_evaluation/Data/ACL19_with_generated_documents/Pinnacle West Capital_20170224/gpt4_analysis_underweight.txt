**Company: Pinnacle West**

**Market Stance: Underweight**

**Rationale and Outlook:**

1. **Regulatory Risks and Challenges:**
   - **Distributed Generation (DG) Policy Changes:** The adoption of the new formula-driven approach for distributed generation compensation represents a significant alteration from the current net metering system. This policy change and its implementation might disrupt revenue streams and introduce uncertainty around the profitability of DG operations. The elimination of energy banking and distinct classification for DG solar customers could potentially restrict growth in this customer segment, affecting long-term profitability.
   - **Rate Review Process:** Although progress has been made towards a constructive settlement proposal, the ongoing rate review process still presents risks. Delays or unfavorable outcomes from this process could impact cash flows and financial stability.

2. **Capital Expenditure and Debt Concerns:**
   - **High Capital Expenditures:** The company plans to spend over $3.4 billion on capital investments over the next three years while managing more than $1.3 billion in projects in 2017 alone. These extensive capital requirements, primarily for grid modernization and enhancing the generation fleet, could strain financial resources and affect debt levels.
   - **Dependence on Capital Markets:** Given the magnitude of the planned capital expenditures, Pinnacle West might increase reliance on capital markets for funding. Any adverse market conditions, such as increased interest rates, may increase the cost of capital, thus impeding potential financial performance.

3. **Operational Risks:**
   - **Plant Retirements and Power Shortfalls:** The intended closure of the Navajo Generating Station by 2019, where APS holds a significant stake, adds pressure to address the generation shortfall of 3,500 MW by 2022. Although partly mitigated by the Ocotillo project and recent power purchase agreements, reliance on market opportunities and customer conservation presents a degree of unpredictability and risk.
   - **Integration of Renewable and Storage Technology:** While initiatives like the EPS Solar Partner Program highlight a forward-looking approach, the integration of such new technologies carries execution and operational risks which could affect overall reliability and cost efficiency.

4. **Environmental and Technological Transformation Risks:**
   - **Transition to Low-Carbon Energy Sources:** While the company is taking steps towards the modernization of its generation fleet and participation in the Western Energy Imbalance Market (producing savings), such shifts toward low-carbon energy sources necessitate high upfront investments and expose the company to technology transformation risks.

5. **Leadership Transition:**
   - **Retirement of Key Executive:** The retirement of Chief Nuclear Officer Randy Edington could lead to transitions in leadership that might impact the company’s operational efficiency and continuity, especially given his pivotal role in strengthening nuclear operations.

**Investment Conclusion:**
Given the combination of regulatory adjustments, heavy reliance on capital expenditure for strategic projects, transition challenges within the energy mix, and potential operational disruptions due to executive changes, adopting an underweight stance on Pinnacle West is recommended. These factors introduce significant uncertainties and potential volatility to the company’s future financial performance and operational stability.

**Action Items for Investors:**
- **Monitor Regulatory Outcomes:** Close attention should be paid to the finalization of rate reviews and responses to regulatory changes.
- **Assess Capital Structure Adjustments:** Evaluate any changes in the capital structure, especially debt levels and interest coverage ratios.
- **Watch Technological Integration:** Track progress on grid modernization and renewable integration projects for signs of execution risk or potential cost overruns.
- **Leadership and Management Changes:** Keep an eye on management transitions and their impact on company strategy and performance.

This underweight recommendation reflects a cautious approach, prioritizing risk assessment and seeking clarity on various uncertainties that might impact Pinnacle West’s financial health and market positioning.
