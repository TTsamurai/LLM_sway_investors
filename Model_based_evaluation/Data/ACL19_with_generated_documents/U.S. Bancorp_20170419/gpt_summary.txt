 and customers. In terms of retail industry exposure, we have minimal exposure to retailers who own their malls, and we are comfortable with our portfolio given the relative small exposure, geographic diversity, and high quality of customers. This has been an area of concern for the investment community, but we have managed our risk effectively.

In terms of earnings results, our net income for the first quarter was essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter, but was up 6.3% versus the first quarter of 2016. Total revenue declined by 2.0% on a linked quarter basis and grew 5.7% compared with the year earlier. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was essentially stable with the fourth quarter and was up 3.7% compared with the prior year, reflecting earning asset growth from a year ago. Non-interest income increased by 8.4% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strength in payment services revenue, trust and investment management fees, and mortgage banking revenue.

Non-interest expense decreased 2.0% compared with the fourth quarter, reflecting seasonally lower costs related to investments in tax advantaged projects, professional services expense, and marketing and business development. On a year-over-year basis, non-interest expense increased 7.1%, driven by higher compensation and employee benefits expenses, marketing and business development expenses, and other expenses.

In terms of capital position, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 9.2%, well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement and our internal target of 8.5%. We returned 78% of our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks in the first quarter and expect to remain in our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 80% going forward.

Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect modest growth in net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis, driven by improved loan growth compared with the first quarter and slightly higher net interest margin. We also expect expenses to be seasonally higher in the second quarter, but we expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the full year. As future rate hikes occur, we model that deposit betas will gradually trend toward a higher level. And we expect credit quality to remain relatively stable in the second quarter, with the loan loss provision increasing in line with loan growth.

In summary, we are confident in our strong performance in the first quarter and remain optimistic about our future outlook. We are focused on managing risk effectively, delivering positive operating leverage, and maintaining a strong capital position to continue returning value to our shareholders. Thank you for your attention and we are now open for questions.
