Summary:
- Loan growth trends: Modest declines in commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, and home equity lending were offset by strong growth in retail leasing and residential mortgages.
- Total average deposits declined slightly on a linked quarter basis but increased on a year-over-year basis.
- Credit quality remained stable, with net charge-offs slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter.
- First quarter net income remained flat compared to the fourth quarter but increased compared to the first quarter of 2016.
- Total revenue declined on a linked quarter basis but grew on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by strong loan growth and strength across fee-based businesses.
- Net interest income remained stable despite fewer days in the quarter and increased on a year-over-year basis.
- Non-interest income decreased on a linked quarter basis but increased on a year-over-year basis, driven by strength in payment services revenue, trust and investment management fees, and mortgage banking revenue.
- Non-interest expenses decreased on a linked quarter basis but increased on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher compensation and employee benefit expenses, marketing and business development expenses, and professional services expenses.
- Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 9.2%, well above the minimum requirement and the internal target.
- Forward-looking guidance includes modest growth in net interest income driven by improved loan growth and slightly higher net interest margin. Loan growth for the year is expected to be in the middle single-digits.
- Deposit beta is expected to gradually trend towards a higher level as future rate hikes occur.
- Auto lending and retail industry exposure remain stable and well positioned for growth.
- Expectations for positive operating leverage and a rise in net interest margin in the second and fourth quarters.
- Expectations for continued growth in credit card, mortgage, and commercial payment space.
- Anticipated growth in the middle market lending space.
- Capital levels are sufficient to accommodate balance sheet growth and return a targeted payout ratio of 60% to 80% to shareholders.
