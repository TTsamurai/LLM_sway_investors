 and a strong credit history. In addition, our retail mortgage business is well positioned to gain share in the purchase market as home sales strengthen in the spring. Despite lower refinancing activity due to higher interest rates, we expect to see growth in this area as well. The retail industry exposure is minimal and we are comfortable with our portfolio, given the small exposure, geographic diversity, and high quality of customers. Our commercial payments and merchant acquiring and processing revenue are also showing positive growth trends, reflecting new account growth and improved market conditions.

Overall, the company's earnings results for the first quarter were solid, with net income essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter and up 6.3% versus the first quarter of 2016. Total revenue grew by 5.7% compared with the year earlier, primarily driven by solid loan growth funded by strong deposit growth and strength across fee businesses. Net interest income was stable despite fewer days in the quarter, and non-interest income increased by 8.4% year-over-year. Non-interest expenses decreased by 2.0% compared with the fourth quarter, reflecting seasonally lower costs and focused investment in brand and business initiatives.

Looking ahead, the company expects modest growth in net interest income driven by improved loan growth and slightly higher net interest margin in the second quarter. Commercial loan growth is expected to accelerate as the year progresses, and the company remains disciplined in lending to the CRE market. Credit quality is expected to remain relatively stable, and the company anticipates positive operating leverage for the full year, with gradual growth in expenses as the year progresses. The company's capital position is strong, with a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio well above minimum requirements, and a targeted payout ratio of 60% to 80% to shareholders.

Based on these key insights and financial metrics derived from the recent earnings conference call transcript, we adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for the company, projecting continued growth in earnings and a solid outlook for the future.
