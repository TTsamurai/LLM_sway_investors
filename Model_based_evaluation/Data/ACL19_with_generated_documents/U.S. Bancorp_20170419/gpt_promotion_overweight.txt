 and a strong product offering, we are confident in the growth potential for our leasing and mortgage businesses. In summary, based on the first quarter earnings call, the company has exhibited stability and growth in various areas such as loan growth, deposits, credit quality, and non-interest income. The company is well-capitalized and remains disciplined in its lending practices. Looking ahead, the company anticipates modest growth in net interest income and commercial loan growth in the second quarter. Additionally, the company remains committed to returning earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, maintaining a strong capital position. With a positive outlook on future loan growth and the continued success of its leasing and mortgage businesses, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company.
