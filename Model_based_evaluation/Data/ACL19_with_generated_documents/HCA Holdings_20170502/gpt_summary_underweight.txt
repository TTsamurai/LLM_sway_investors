Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, there are several key financial metrics that indicate a concerning trend for this company. 

Admissions and revenue: While same-facility admissions and equivalent admissions increased for Medicare, Medicaid, and self-pay and charity admissions, the same-facility managed care other and exchange admissions declined. Additionally, the revenue per equivalent admission for the international division was negatively impacted in the quarter. 

Expenses: Operating expenses per equivalent admission increased, particularly in supply expense, as well as salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenues. Wage rates increased and labor trends remain stable. 

Cash flow and debt: Cash flow from operations decreased slightly and free cash flow also declined. Debt to adjusted EBITDA increased slightly. 

Healthcare reform impact: Exchange admissions and ER visits decreased, which may indicate a potential impact from healthcare reform trends. 

Guidance and balance sheet: The company reaffirmed its guidance for the year, with a low end of 3% growth and a high end of 7%, although mid-point is around 5%. The leverage is at 3.83 times, slightly higher than the previous year, but within the company's range of 3.5 to 4.5 times. 

Supply cost trends: Overall, supply cost trends have been well-managed, with the increase in device costs attributed to volume growth in high-acuity procedures. 

Based on these financial metrics and trends, it is advisable to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for this company. The declining admissions in certain payer classes, increased operating expenses, and the impact of healthcare reform on volume and revenue all raise concerns about the company's financial performance in the near future. Additionally, the slight decrease in cash flow and increase in debt leverage suggests potential challenges in maintaining financial stability. Therefore, it is recommended to approach investment in this company with caution.
