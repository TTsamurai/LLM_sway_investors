The marine, outdoor, aviation and fitness segments collectively contributed 75% of total revenues with strong gross and operating margins. The auto segment experienced a decline in revenue and operating margin. The company maintained its guidance issued in February due to the seasonal nature of the first quarter.

Marine: Experienced market share gains with all major product categories performing well.
Outdoor: Strong demand for outdoor wearables with new product offerings generating positive customer feedback.
Aviation: Solid revenue growth driven by aftermarket products and new product offerings.
Fitness: Declined in revenue due to the maturing market for basic activity trackers, offset by growth in advanced wearables with GPS capability.
Auto: Revenues declined due to the ongoing decline of the PND market but was partially offset by growth in Auto OEM product lines.

In terms of future expectations, the company is focused on gaining market share through innovations and differentiation in the marine, outdoor, and aviation segments. Although the fitness segment experienced challenges, there are growth opportunities in advanced wearables with GPS capability. The auto segment is focused on disciplined execution to bring desired innovation to the market.

Overall, the company is pleased with its first quarter results and remains confident in its product roadmap and growth opportunities in various segments.
