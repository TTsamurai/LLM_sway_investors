Overall, the company is reiterating its organic revenue growth rates and has revised its consolidated and segment revenue dollar ranges due to the divestiture. The company has also announced a $4 billion share repurchase program, aiming to generate excess cash flow in the fourth quarter and throughout 2018. The company's increased full-year adjusted EPS guidance includes dilution from divestitures, but also benefits from the impact of the debt refinance and lower tax rates.

These metrics indicate a positive financial performance and outlook for the company, including growth in revenue, EBITDA, and earnings per share. The company is also focused on managing its debt and cash flow, with plans to return cash to shareholders through a share repurchase program.
