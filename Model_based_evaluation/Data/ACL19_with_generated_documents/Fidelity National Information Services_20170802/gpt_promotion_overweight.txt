Based on the recent financial results and the company's performance, I highly recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The second quarter revenue increased to $2.3 billion, a 2.3% increase on an organic basis, and the adjusted EBITDA grew to $746 million, a 7.2% increase compared to the prior-year quarter. The adjusted net earnings from continuing operations was $342 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased 13.3% to $1.02 per share compared to $0.90 per share in the prior-year quarter. The company's Institutional and Wholesale business increased 1.4%, and Banking and Payments grew 6.2%. In the Global Financial Solutions segment, organic revenue grew 3.9% to $1.1 billion, and adjusted EBITDA increased 15.5% to $331 million. Furthermore, the company executed significant and strategic transactions to create long-term benefits for shareholders, including the sale of a majority stake in its consulting assets. The company's successful execution and growth projection represent a potential for a positive return on investment. The company's net impact to full-year 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance is an increase to $4.22 to $4.32 per share, a 10% to 13% growth compared to the prior-year period. Additionally, the company has announced the authorization of a $4 billion share repurchase program. Based on these favorable financial results and strategic initiatives, the company presents a compelling opportunity for investment.
