Based on the analysis of the recent earnings call and other considerations, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company for several reasons:

1. **Sluggish Organic Growth**: Despite the company's reported increase in adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share, the organic revenue growth remains modest. The first half of the year only saw a 2% increase on an organic basis, hinting at underlying challenges in core business activities that could inhibit future growth. 

2. **Divestiture Impact**: The recently announced divestitures, including the sale of a majority stake in their consulting assets, may lead to short-term financial gains but could also undermine long-term revenue streams. The expected dilution from these transactions, although partially offset by debt refinancing benefits, introduces an element of risk regarding sustained profitability.

3. **Debt Levels**: While efforts to optimize capital structure through European debt offerings and a tender offering on outstanding debt are noteworthy, the company's high level of outstanding debt ($9.7 billion) remains a concern. Despite refinancing activities projected to save approximately $60 million in 2018 in interest expenses, the leverage ratio and the ability to manage this debt effectively in fluctuating economic conditions may pose financial risks.

4. **Modest Cash Flow Generation**: The reported free cash flow and cash conversion rates, though solid, highlight concerns regarding the company's liquidity and operational efficiency. Q2's particularly low cash flow generation underlines potential volatility in financial performance, which could impact investment security.

5. **Market and Competitive Pressures**: Given the moderate growth in key segments such as Banking and Wealth, as well as Payments, it is possible that the company could face increasing competitive pressures. This could further strain their market positioning and ability to attract new clients, especially in a technology-driven financial landscape.

6. **Potential Overoptimism in Guidance**: The revised full-year guidance, while positive, might reflect an overly optimistic outlook given the operational and market challenges noted. This optimism could potentially lead to future adjustments or corrections in projected financial outcomes, thus introducing additional investment risk.

In conclusion, while the company is actively managing its financial strategy through debt refinancing and divestitures, and showing resilience in some financial metrics, the underlying risks associated with modest organic growth, high leverage, and market pressures suggest a cautious approach. Investors might consider prioritizing other opportunities with clearer growth trajectories and lower financial risk levels until clearer signs of strategic success and financial stability emerge from the company.
