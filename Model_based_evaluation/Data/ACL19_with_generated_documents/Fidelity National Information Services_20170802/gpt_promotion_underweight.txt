Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. While the company reported increases in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and earnings per share, it is important to note that these numbers were influenced by divestitures of certain consulting assets, which will result in dilution to earnings per share in 2017. Additionally, the company's effective tax rate decreased to 29.5% for the quarter, resulting in a $0.03 benefit for the second-quarter earnings compared to original expectations. The decrease in the effective tax rate was driven by a combination of tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and from higher international profits, but it is unlikely to be sustainable in the long term.

Furthermore, the company executed two significant transactions, which create long-term benefits to shareholders. However, the impact of these transactions on earnings per share should be carefully evaluated, as there are complexities related to the retained equity interest and the refinancing activities.

It is also important to note that the company has reiterated its organic revenue growth rates and revised its consolidated and segment revenue dollar ranges due to the divestiture of consulting assets. While the company is confident in its full-year growth rates, it is essential to consider the impact of the divestitures on the growth and margin profiles of the operating segments. Additionally, the company's leverage will be impacted by the refinancing activities, and it is crucial to monitor the debt levels and cash flows.

In conclusion, while the company has reported positive financial results, the impact of divestitures and refinancing activities should be closely monitored. It is recommended to take a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company and consider the potential risks associated with the recent earnings call before making investment decisions.
