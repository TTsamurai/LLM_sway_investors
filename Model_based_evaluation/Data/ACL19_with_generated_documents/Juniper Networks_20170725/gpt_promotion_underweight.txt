in the market. And Jake, we're always going to be maniacally focused on execution. We think we're engaging with our customers in the right ways. We believe that our products are on the leading edge, and we will continue to invest in automation, making sure that we can maintain a cost advantage for our customers. Thanks, Su. I'll do with the last question first. This notion of order checks and whether our sales organization is doing a good job, we have a lot of confidence in our sales organization. And we measure them on a variety of different criteria. We look at attach rates. We measure them on their ability to get new business as well as the ability to maintain the business that they have within a customer. And over the course of this year, those metrics have been very strong. Given that, as we saw in Q2, we achieved the high end of our revenue guidance, we believe that our business is on track and our sales organization is doing a fantastic job. In terms of where the market goes from here and our ability to outperform, well, let me just sort of start by saying that all of our products are going to market with industry leading performance. We're seeing that in the wins that were discussed earlier on this call and I anticipate that we're likely to continue to be a really strong player in our markets. Now, having said that, it's not going to get easier going forward. I think we're going to have to be more and more relevant in the ways we innovate. We're going to have to be very coherent in the way we go to market with different customer challenges. And we're going to have to maintain the cost structure that we have in this company. So it is not going to be easy to outperform. But we believe that in the Switching constructs, in the Security constructs with both Contrail and our more physical use case security, and on Routing, I think, we are very well positioned to continue to be a strong player in those markets and deliver growth that outperforms the market. So in summary, I appreciate the question. I'm very confident in the outlook for the company and hope that we can exceed your expectations. Thank you, everyone.

Based on these comments, the company has exhibited solid performance in its key growth areas such as Cloud, Switching, and Security, while facing challenges in the federal government sector. The overall cautious perspective arises from potential risk factors such as lumpiness in Cloud vertical deployments, continued price erosion in the market, and increasing competition within the industry. Additionally, the company may not necessarily outperform the market in the long term without addressing potential challenges in maintaining cost efficiency and operational simplicity.

Executive's comments on momentum in the first half of the year and positive outlook for the Cloud vertical should be viewed with caution due to potential timing of deployments and the competitive nature of the market. Moreover, the company's cautious approach towards the federal government sector and need for ongoing innovation and automation to stay ahead in the market should be considered as potential risk factors affecting the investment stance. Therefore, a skeptical or cautious perspective should be taken when considering an 'underweight' investment stance for the company based on its recent earnings call.
