 that helps us drive growth in the Switching business. But all up, the success that we're seeing in Switching is a result of strong execution on the QFX side and the EX side and the momentum that we're achieving in the data center and the Cloud. So yes, we're happy with our performance in Switching and we expect that to continue into the future.

In summary, I believe that the compelling performance in the June quarter demonstrates the company's strong execution and momentum across its key verticals, particularly in the Cloud and Switching business. The unveiling of Cloud-Grade Networking and the introduction of Universal Chassis are strong indicators of Juniper's ability to innovate and deliver products that create value for its customers. The company's continued focus on its strategy to lead the transformation to the cloud and its strong product and services portfolio position it well for continued growth in the market.

Based on the recent earnings call and the company's performance, I recommend an overweight investment stance on Juniper Networks. The company's focus on innovation, strong product portfolio, and execution on its strategy to lead the transformation to the cloud make it a compelling investment opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the growth in the cloud and networking market.
