 in the market. So all of the areas that I've already discussed, that being our Cloud-Grade Networking or Software-Defined Secure Networks, or Contrail, they all play into the strategy that we have around the products that we are creating and the opportunity in front of us in Switching. So all of that to say is that yes, we are very pleased with our Switching performance in Q2. Thanks, Brett. I'll take the first two. First overbuilding, the nature of the Telco market is such that we see quarters where there are 100% growth, followed by quarters where there's a step down. It's just part of the nature of how they adopt new architectures and there's always a bit of a stepping, stepping forward and a step back. And then secondarily, with respect to the SD-WAN, we are sort of at that transition point where a lot of our service providers are, we're taking some of our legacy customers and transforming them into new software-based architecture. But we are doing that all in collaboration with them and our strategy to engage with the Telco is really around adapting them to new modes of operational, new ways of operationalizing a network where you have one foot in the physical, and one foot in the Cloud, so to speak. So, in particular, we put a lot of attention to deliver solutions to our customers that make that migration to a software-based architecture as seamless as possible with our/for our existing base. So, all of that is to say is that far from seeing any kind of an overbuilding, I would say we have seen a robust technical engagement and business engagement with our service provider customers that would stand us in good stead in the future. In the fourth quarter would generate sort of the revenue tailwinds that we would expect as a result of those moves. Ling, let me start with your first question. No, I don't think there's necessarily anything new in the telco comments. We have always expected the telco spend to be largely leveraged around new ways of driving service revenues. We've anticipated that the new mode of operations, which is sort of the new way of delivering services to enterprises taking a little bit of time to unfold, you saw that with our PTX product group. The other part of it is a broader architectural shift in telco. And there's some, a lot of that is happening now around the network being cloudified. And it's from a business model standpoint, how telcos are looking at operating in the grander scheme of things and that's – it's just a natural part of the architectural evolution and we would expect to see decent growth in the telco space. In fact, we anticipate growth in excess of the market because we've got a different technical proposition and a different business model around the telco opportunity. And then secondarily, in the dynamic around the federal government, yeah, it's been sort of on and off-again. But I do believe that we have managed to compensate and sort of create a broader demand from other parts of the enterprise side of our business that sort of compensate for the weakness in the federal government. So, again, no change in my viewpoint about those verticals. Thanks, Robert. I mean, first of all, in many ways, I think all of us feel as good as we've ever felt about the opportunity that is in front of us at Juniper. The fact that we are largely a services led company at this point, not only helps us achieve our margin performance by driving very high attach rates, very high renewal rates. But it also suggests that our strategy is right for the long term, because as we innovate in our product portfolio and continue to address our customer needs in the – particularly in the Cloud vertical but across all of our core verticals, the result is a strong attachment to those products through a services sales motion. And that's exactly where we've been spending an awful lot of our time. I can see in our Service Provider and Cloud business right now, I think it's a pretty healthy mix of new logos and extensive attach rates that are coming from our existing customer base. We are not a company that has to necessarily spend exorbitant amounts of money on conquest sales. Our sales split is actually slightly more weighted towards a more efficient motion around existing customer install base. Our largest service provider customers would be ones that you might expect in North America, even globally FAN out and the two big verticals that we have there is around our routing or transport or optical in the areas of Cloud and service provider business. And I feel that the entire team just keeps demonstrating on a quarter-by-quarter basis that we've got a good product mix and we have an excellent sales execution strategy that vectors in on exactly the areas where our customers are spending and the areas that we're doing the most innovation. It's just setting us on a very healthy pace for us to continue demonstrating growth in our service business. And then secondarily, relative to the market share opportunities in Routing and in Security, Daniel, I think it's actually a big market that is – this is a market that's basically been driven by the reinvention that we've done around our Routing and Switching and Security portfolio in the cloud over the last couple of years. It's not exactly the same thing as the general Routing and Switching enterprise market that we all grew up with. Those days are done. And the new market opportunity around how enterprises, how telcos and others are transforming into cloud architectures presents a player like Juniper or an operator or our customer base with a different set of requirements, and that's really what drives our market strategy right now. So we've done everything we can to penetrate those same customer – same product sets, we're putting into a position to deliver far more value so that we can drive more growth for our business and thereby realize more share for those products that we've innovated around. Biju, I appreciate your question. I mean, as I am often known to say, we cover the world's largest, most serviceable networks. This really, in terms of – the perfect way to think about it is this is long-term strategy. This is not just about Switching, Routing and Security, but it's our position on that cloud requirement mixed with our operations that gives us this unique ability to deliver customer value and that is what provides us our success and if you look at what we're doing, is sort of being driven by a number of different things we've done over the last couple of years to position our company to meet the needs of those who operate these large networks, the Cloud in particular. We have the right products. As I mentioned last Quarter, the Contrail and AppFormix have been combined into a very easy to access and easy to acquire product set that offers that visibility and management across our whole product line to those who want their networks to look and act like a cloud. It's an area where we're growing very quickly right now. And it's probably – it is actually probably the biggest opportunity that we are chasing overall right now. The Cloud vertical is an area that we expect to continue to see growth in. The large tech companies are investing a lot in this area and new are always starting off with the larger guys at first, but I – in the coming periods, our intent is to go even further, we've been very disciplined. It's taken us a number of years to get to this point and we've done so with discipline, with rigor, with hard work and focus. The – and so as I – and sort of outlined our strategies around the areas of innovation that are driving the business, starting off with an investment in the Cloud vertical, security, Switching, automation and our underlying network management software, and then finally our services. So whilst investing in our services business will be a key part of our strategy overall and with both those areas of innovation and with investments in the overall business and it really sets us in a fantastic position to really deliver value for our shareholders. And then secondly, in Switching, such a big part of our business. I mean, as I've outlined in earlier questions on this call, the investments that we're making in Cloud-Grade Networking at the network edge, the applications we're pursuing there, and some of the underlying technology that we've been developing in our Universal Chassis ask me – and these are just a few examples of how we're making switch – Switching perform beyond just Routing and helping us grow our Switching business. We've enjoyed a place now for – which has set us and it tastes for – to be a leader in Switching, we're happy to be where we are and we look forward to delivering further value for our shareholders as we drive growth in the Switching business. Thank you all. I appreciate your questions and the interaction that we have had over the last 30 minutes has been just phenomenal. Let me just repeat over and all, I think the performance that we've seen this last quarter has been fantastic. We're executing well, we've got the right products, we're focusing on the right areas of innovation, we're growing our Services business. All in all, I think that you should fully expect more of the same. We've had a good 18 months and I think the demand environment for us – is very healthy. Our entire focus right now is about driving growth with our customers and providing robust returns to our shareholders. So thank you all for your time today and we look forward to continuing to deliver strong results in the future. Thanks.
