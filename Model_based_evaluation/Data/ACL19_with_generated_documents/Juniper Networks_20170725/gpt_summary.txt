 line. Sure, Iker, I'll start with the question around Cloud services. I'd say that our Cloud business overall is a good momentum, and I think it's directly propelled by our unique technologies like Universal Chassis and Junos Node Slicing, which are very well suited for Cloud oriented solutions. Then from a Cloud networking perspective, we also continue to see momentum in AppFormix, our cloud operations management product which is now integrated across our entire portfolio and is contributing to our services revenue growth. And then lastly, I think on the services overall, we continue to see good demand across all horizontal, vertical and geo opportunities and we believe it is a critical piece of our overall strategy and portfolio. As far as 5G is concerned, we expect that the service provider customers in general, and especially our Tier 1 Cloud and Telcos are going to have a broader opportunity to leverage our solutions. And while I think there's ongoing spending in that area so, there is certainly our opportunity for us to have benefits over time. So all in all, we're pleased with the progress with 5G and how it is going to factor into our strategy. In fact, I think 5G is directly related to how Cloud-Grade Networking helps Cloud providers since it enables them to increase service agility and speed, reduce operational costs and get the service providers ready for 5G over time. And with the expectation of us to stay in the Cloud just getting higher and higher as we go forward, I think we're very much on the right trajectory with our strategy and with our products and services that we deliver. And on the positive trends for the remainder of the year, well, we've already discussed in the previous questions that we believe that we'll have strong momentum in the Cloud, especially in terms of the Cloud grade, 5G, and digital transformation areas. These are all very much in line with our long-term strategy and our fundamental focus areas. When you put these angles alongside our execution, the way our product portfolio is growing and the way that we're executing on our value to our customer base, especially our Cloud and service provider customers, to name a few, I think, we're in a really good position. So I can say that we're definitely optimistic about the future and believe that we're off to a strong start and are primed to take advantage of both the current market opportunities and areas that will trend upwards over time. And then on the topic of federal budgets, I would say that federal spending "are we." Yes, there is a bit of a lag. We have seen some slowdown, especially in Q2. We don't necessarily see a great change in that, however, for the future because it is always an area that is subject to some sort of ebb and flow. But overall, we're very much focused on the broader enterprise opportunity and on strengthening and having our security investments pay off and provide us with momentum there instead. And as I've mentioned before, with Juniper starting to show momentum in Security, and as we continue to further diversify our customer base by bringing on new logos, especially in the enterprise sector, I'm confident that we will make those federal slow-downs have a lesser impact on our overall results. So all in all, I really think that we're on a strong upward trajectory right now and I'm excited about what we have in front of us. Matt, let me get started. The first point I will make is on revenue growth. So, as I mentioned before, we are off to a good start in 2017 coming anywhere on the upper end of our revenue range, and I am confident that we can meet our objective of achieving revenue growth for the full year. But just to add more color, I think that we're seeing positive momentum in the Cloud vertical, which was also a positive trend in Q2 and to attribute that, it is that a lot of focus inside the company is there and we've been maintaining that momentum. I think we're also seeing optimism. And despite the fact that the Cloud vertical is likely going to have some lumpiness and will need to deal with the timing of deployments, I'm 100% confident in our strategy for the Cloud vertical and am optimistic that we will be able to maintain the momentum. So that's where we are right now in terms of revenue growth. Shifting over to some more details on the product side, I am very positive about what we are seeing there. The Cloud-Grade Networking initiative we launched including Junos Node Slicing and Universal Chassis, is expected to bring significant value to our customers and will continue to have impacts in the market moving forward. Universal Chassis is specifically designed to provide the ability to adapt to ever-changing business requirements for our customers by enabling a unified platform optimized for routing and switching across their networks. We are expecting revenue for this product in the second half of the year and I think this product has really underscored the focus we have on driving ongoing product innovation to address customer needs and, we are expecting impacts over the next few quarters. So again, from a big picture perspective, I am very much pleased with where we're at with our business across all those areas and am excited about the future. Thanks, David and Rich. First of all, we fully acknowledge that pricing and competitive pressures are pretty high in our industry, and that's particularly true in tough economic times or budgeting. I would say that we are generally seeing that margin pressures from multiple fronts including traffic growth, cloud migration, and new service provider architectures that are leading to an unexpectedly high cost to compete and that's becoming a headwind. I mentioned a couple of key ways we intend to address this on the previous answers including value engineering, striving for more customer insertions in some of our key regions and of course making our way in some innovative projects with which we're addressing the marketplace and we are also expecting the impacts of these will come through in the mid-to-long term. But one thing I'll say is here is the strength and the success of our new products. 5G, for example, has and will continue to drive significant innovation in the market and we're seeing strong traction of our Cloud-Grade Networking products that are directly targeted for accelerated agility and innovation in a Cloud era. Not to mention, that we've also seen good momentum with Contrail, our cloud orchestration system, where we've achieved more penetration in APAC and EMEA and in leveraging the machine learning capabilities of AppFormix which has already been integrated into our entire product line, I think we are literally leading the charge in automated Cloud networking. So I believe that we are off to a very solid start for the year and as I said, we remain absolutely optimistic about delivering both revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth for the full year. And we extend our thanks to our customers, partners and shareholders for their continued support and confidence, and to our employees for their continued hard work and dedication to successfully execute on our strategy and create value for all our stakeholders. Thank you, Sandra, I appreciate your questions. I'll address the first question around Switching. As you saw through our performance in Q2, we have been demonstrating really strong momentum with year-over-year and sequential revenue growth across all verticals, and have been particularly pleased with our performance in switch products. The 100-gigabit infrastructure is also driving the continued movement to our end-to-end solutions with our ToR and spine portfolio, and I would like to say that we are expecting further momentum and growth with these trends in the second half of the year. From a Routing perspective, I'm also very pleased with the performance of our MX and the strength of our PTX products in Cloud customers and new telco insertions we achieved in Q2. I kind of expect further sequential and year-on-year growth from Routing as well. Security products from the Software Defined Secure Networks platform have also delivered pervasively across multi-vendor environments and public clouds in the integrations of the new MacOS software with our entire product line, and we're seeing some initial traction and increased interest from new Enterprise customers, so I'm excited about the progress we've made. Next, I think we can also note from our Q2 performance that we've seen strong customer renewal rates in our services business and that's a key indicator of the value we're providing to our customers and are seeing increased demands for professional services. And so I'm absolutely pleased with our opportunity and just want to echo my excitement about our prospects for the remainder of the year. I would also like to add that with all these positive indicators and the way we've been executing on our strategy, I am optimistic and looking forward to delivering revenue growth for the full year. I'm happy with our overall performance and with the continued momentum we are seeing in our Cloud vertical and our Switching. So those are some key indicators and I think they're worth mentioning. Thank you, Martha, I appreciate the question. In terms of growth, we're off to a strong start in the first half of this year. Specifically, we saw good momentum in the Cloud vertical in Q2, and I believe that we have a solid opportunity in that market as we go forward. And as I said earlier, certainly, there were some important new customer wins in Cloud, particularly as it relates to Cloud-Grade Networking, which we believe is also a key driver of growth and a differentiator for us. Moving on, like I've always said, Cloud and SaaS are still huge drivers for us and the reality is digital transformation continues to be at the forefront of customer minds as they seek to move towards the hybrid cloud and SaaS models. The importance of data security and visibility of workloads in a multi-cloud environment remain top of mind for many of our customers, and so I would say that there is 5G news to the movement of traffic as we expect an increase in spending across Telco and related areas. In addition, I believe we've announced several important solutions with Cloud-Grade Networking and made advancements in SDSN and Contrail. We're very optimistic about the future and look forward to delivering revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth for the full year. So really excited about the opportunity we have in front of us. Thanks, Marcus. I'll touch on a few key points mentioned in the call. First, we delivered good revenue and earnings growth in the recent quarter, with record revenue in Switching and continued strength in the Cloud vertical. The Cloud-Grade Networking announcement was a significant milestone, accelerating agility and innovation in the cloud era. We unveiled Cloud-Grade Networking products that enable a cloud-level agility and operational scale to networks, and these products have already shown promising customer wins in our service provider vertical. Our momentum in Switching has been very strong, with continued revenue growth in cloud data center and new insertions in telecom. In Routing, we saw good momentum with MX products and PTX products in cloud customers. Our Security products also saw enhancements, and the Software-Defined Secure Networks platform has continued to gain traction with new customer wins in key regions. Our services business has also seen strong renewal and attach rates of support contracts, along with increased demand for professional services. Our Cloud and data center strategy continues to drive our growth, and we are optimistic about delivering revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth for the full year. Thank you, Stacey, I appreciate your question. We had a strong quarter in Switching, driven by year-over-year and sequential revenue growth across all verticals, particularly in cloud data center and new insertions in telecom. We also saw good performance in Routing, with strong growth in MX and PTX products. Overall, we continue to see momentum in the Cloud and a digital transformation across all focus verticals, including the growing opportunity in Cloud-Grade Networking. Our Services business also saw strong renewal and attach rates, demonstrating our continued value to customers. We believe we are well-positioned for continued success and growth for the full year.
