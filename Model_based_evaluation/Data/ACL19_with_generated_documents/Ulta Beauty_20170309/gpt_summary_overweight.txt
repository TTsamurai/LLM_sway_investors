Ulta Beauty's salon sales increased by 15.2%, and comps grew by 8.8%, driven by strength in hair color and makeup services. The company's supply chain operations performed well, with improved shipping lead times and 88% of orders shipping within 48 hours.

Looking forward, Ulta Beauty is excited about its new partnership with the Estee Lauder Companies and the launch of MAC brand online in early May, with plans to reach more than 100 stores in 2017. The company is also confident about its long-term guidance of 7% to 9% earnings growth and maintains a strong commitment to investing in the long-term growth of the business.

Based on the strong financial performance and strategic initiatives, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance on Ulta Beauty, as the company is well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities for long-term growth and create substantial shareholder value.
