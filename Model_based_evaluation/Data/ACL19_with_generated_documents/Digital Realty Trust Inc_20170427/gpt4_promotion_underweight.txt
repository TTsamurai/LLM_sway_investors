**Investment Stance: Underweight**

**Company Overview:**
During our comprehensive review of the recent earnings call, our analysis highlights several points of concern that support an 'underweight' investment stance on the company.

**Leasing and Market Concentration:**
While the company reported robust leasing activity, with total bookings of over $50 million for the first quarter, we find it necessary to highlight the concentration of activity. Approximately two-thirds of leasing activity was concentrated in North America, indicating potential regional vulnerabilities, especially against macroeconomic shifts or localized market saturation. Further, the largest deal accounted for a mere 3.2 megawatts, pointing to a lack in substantial long-term anchor leases that typically provide stability.

**Tenant Retention Concerns:**
The first quarter reported a starkly low tenant retention rate at 42%, significantly below the historical average. Although the company successfully re-leased the spaces linked to notable move-outs, the underlying issues causing these move-outs—such as a shrinking client need and unsuccessful negotiation on renewals—underscore potential inefficiencies or emerging competitiveness in pricing or offerings.

**Financial Health and Projections:**
The forward-looking statements suggest a dip in quarterly performance ahead, owing to higher property tax accruals and general & administrative expenses. Moreover, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could impact profitability, as indicated by the 150 basis point drag in Q1. While the company has improved its leasing lag and increased its bookings, the cyclical nature of earnings highlighted does not convincingly mitigate these financial pressures.

**Integration and Operational Challenges:**
Although the integration of European teams and streamlining of processes has begun, there remains an inherent risk in alignment and executing efficiency gains without external impact. The sunset of multiple general ledger systems, though potentially cost-effective, could lead to transitional inefficiencies that may temporarily disrupt service quality or operational efficiency.

**Market and Geographical Expansion Risks:**
Plans for expansion, such as the rollout of Layer 3 capabilities and expansion across several U.S. markets, are optimistic. However, these initiatives require substantial capital and operational realignment. The company’s substantial development and capital expenditure (ranging up to $1 billion for development CapEx in 2017) further emphasize the financial burden and execution risks involved.

**Conclusion:**
In light of the above factors, including concerns over tenant retention, regional concentration of operations, and the impending financial strains from administrative expansions and capex burdens, we recommend an 'underweight' stance on the stock. Potential investors should be wary of the operational and market challenges that might affect the company's profitability and stability in the near term. This cautious approach is aligned with ensuring investment strategies incorporate the potential for underperformance as the company navigates through its transitional phase and ambitious expansion plans.
