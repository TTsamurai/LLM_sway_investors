. In terms of caution or skepticism, I would mention that the potential drag from foreign exchange and a slow down in run rate for the second and third quarters, as mentioned in the earnings call, could affect the stock and investment performance. Additionally, the high leverage and financing strategies, such as the forward equity offering and long-term debt, could be concerning to investors. The mentions of integration processes and restructuring in the sales team, as well as the uncertainty around the timing of stock grants and property tax accruals, could also raise some red flags. Overall, the cautious stance would be based on the uncertainties and potential risks outlined in the earnings call.
