. So overall, we are seeing positive trends in terms of the booking activity, customer retention, and revenue growth. The recent earnings call showcased the company's success in signing new leases for space and power, totaling $42 million during the first quarter, including a $9 million contribution from interconnection. The company transacted in 21 of their 33 global markets during the first quarter, showing strong market presence. Additionally, the company added 28 new logos and signed over 200 leases for space and power, indicating a healthy demand for their services.

In terms of integration, the company is off to a strong start in 2017, with a focus on consolidating systems and streamlining processes. They have unified their product offerings under a single Digital Realty brand and expect to complete integration of recent acquisitions into their ongoing operations by the end of the year.

In terms of financial performance, the company reported solid growth in core FFO per share and raised the low end of their guidance range by $0.05, reflecting outperformance during the first quarter and a growing outlook for the remainder of the year. Their sources and uses of capital also indicate a strong financial position and future growth opportunities, with plans to settle their forward equity offering, generate proceeds from non-core asset sales, cash flow from operations, and raise debt to support their growth plans.

Overall, the company's strong performance in the first quarter, positive integration efforts, and solid financial position make it a compelling investment opportunity, and I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on this company based on their recent earnings call.
