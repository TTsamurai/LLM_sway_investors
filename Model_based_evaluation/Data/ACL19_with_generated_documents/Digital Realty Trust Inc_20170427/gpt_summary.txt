Our current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced, stands at $79 million, with a weighted average lag between signings and commencements of less than three months.

Tenant retention was at 42% during the first quarter, driven by two unique move-outs. However, if excluding these special situations, retention would have been north of 80% across all property types.

Cash re-leasing spreads were up 3.1% overall with a positive mark-to-market across all property types during the first quarter. We expect cash re-leasing spreads to be positive for the full year in 2017.

For the first quarter, same capital cash NOI growth was 3.4% on a reported basis and 4.2% on a constant currency basis. Core FFO per share grew 7% on a reported basis and nearly 9% on a constant currency basis.

S&P has revised the outlook on our BBB flat credit ratings to positive during the first quarter, demonstrating the strength of our financial condition and the favorable industry backdrop.

In summary, the company has demonstrated a strong start to the year with robust leasing activity, strong customer demand, and positive financial performance. The company expects to continue this momentum into the remainder of the year, although it is important to note that there may be some quarterly fluctuations due to specific factors such as G&A expenses and property tax accruals. Overall, the company remains confident in its outlook and has raised the low end of its guidance range for the year.
