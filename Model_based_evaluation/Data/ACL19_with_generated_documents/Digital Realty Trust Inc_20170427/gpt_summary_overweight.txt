. So, in summary, the leasing activity for the first quarter was strong, with total bookings over $50 million, including contributions from interconnection. The quarter saw strong customer demand, with wins from top cloud service providers, specialized cloud verticals, and other vibrant customers driving the digital economy. The company transacted in 21 of their 33 global markets, with approximately two-thirds of the activity concentrated in North America. Integration efforts are underway, with a focus on consolidating systems and streamlining processes, leading to efficiency gains. The current backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $79 million, with a weighted average lag of less than three months. Tenant retention was slightly below historical average at 42% during the first quarter, mainly due to unique move-outs. Renewal leasing activity saw positive cash re-leasing spreads and gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across the portfolio. Operating performance was strong, with overall portfolio occupancy at 89.4%. Core FFO per share grew 7% on a reported basis and almost 9% on a constant currency basis. The company expects a dip in the run rate in the second and third quarters, with a rebound in the fourth quarter due to higher property tax accruals, higher G&A expense, and the settlement of remaining shares subject to forward sale agreements. The company's financial condition is strong, with debt-to-EBITDA below five times and a fixed charge coverage above four times. The company raised the low end of their guidance range by $0.05, reflecting outperformance during the first quarter and growing confidence in the outlook for the remainder of the year.

In conclusion, the company's strong leasing activity, positive financial performance, and robust integration efforts support an 'overweight' investment stance. With a clear runway for growth and a well-positioned balance sheet, the company is poised for continued success in the market.
