. The company's recent earnings conference call transcript reflects a positive outlook, with strong leasing activity and a focus on integration and expansion. The company signed over 200 leases for space and power, with a concentration in North America, Europe, and Asia. They also added 28 new logos and completed more than 900 transactions. The backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced stands at $79 million, and the weighted average lag between signings and commencements remained healthy at less than three months.

The company saw strong tenant retention, with the exception of two unique move-outs. Cash re-leasing spreads were positive overall for the first quarter, indicating a steady improvement in the mark-to-market across the portfolio. The company's overall portfolio occupancy was unchanged at 89.4%, with a slight improvement in same capital portfolio occupancy.

From a financial perspective, the company's core FFO per share grew 7% on a reported basis and was up nearly 9% on a constant currency basis. The company's balance sheet is well-positioned for growth, with fixed charge coverage above four times and debt-to-EBITDA below five times.

The company's future outlook appears positive, with expectations of steady growth and continuing progress in integrating acquisitions and expanding their footprint. However, the financial metrics indicate a moderate outlook, with a dip in the run rate expected in the second and third quarters before rebounding in the fourth quarter due to higher expenses and settlement of additional shares subject to forward sale agreements. Additionally, the company expects to record a non-cash charge related to the redemption of preferred stock in the second quarter. This outlook may suggest an 'underweight' investment stance given potential short-term fluctuations and expenses.
