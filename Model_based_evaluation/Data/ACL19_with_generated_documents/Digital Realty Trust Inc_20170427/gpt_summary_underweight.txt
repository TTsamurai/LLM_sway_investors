. Thank you, Andy. Based on the information provided in the conference call transcript, it is evident that Digital Realty had a strong first quarter with positive growth in lease signings, expansions in both colocation and interconnection, and a healthy backlog of leases signed but not yet commenced. The company also experienced steady improvement in occupancy rates and positive cash re-leasing spreads, demonstrating a positive trend in both renewal leasing activity and overall operations.

However, as a financial analyst adopting an 'underweight' investment stance, it is important to critically analyze key financial metrics to determine the company's future potential and performance. Despite the positive trends mentioned, a few areas of concern can be identified.

Firstly, the renewal leasing activity saw a tenant retention rate well below historical average at 42% during the first quarter, driven by unique move-outs. This could indicate potential challenges in retaining high-value tenants and may have negative implications for future revenue stability.

Additionally, while the company saw a positive performance in the first quarter, it is important to note that the guidance for the second and third quarters anticipates a dip in run rate due to higher expenses related to property tax accruals, G&A expense, and the settlement of shares. This suggests potential volatility in future financial performance and raises questions about sustainable growth.

Furthermore, the company's plan to substantially complete integration of recent acquisitions into ongoing operations and a product rationalization later this year may pose risks and uncertainties in achieving synergies and operational efficiency. This could impact the company's ability to meet its long-term financing strategy and maintain growth.

Overall, while Digital Realty had a positive first quarter, the identified concerns in tenant retention, expected dip in run rate, and integration challenges warrant an 'underweight' investment stance. It is important to closely monitor the company's financial performance, operational efficiency, and execution of integration strategies to assess its future potential and mitigate investment risks.
