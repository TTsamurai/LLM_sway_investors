Based on the recent earnings call for Stericycle, I would recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. The company reported a net loss attributable to Stericycle of $148.8 million or a loss per share of $1.74, primarily due to the impact of the proposed class action settlement. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.15. Additionally, the gross profit was $381.8 million, or 41.6% of revenues, and adjusted income from operations or EBITA was $183.1 million, or 20% of revenues. The company's net interest expense was $23.7 million and the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 37.1%. The company's covenant debt to EBITDA ratio was 3.46 at the end of the quarter, suggesting a high level of debt. 

Furthermore, the company mentioned that acquisitions contributed $8.6 million to growth in the quarter, but divestitures reduced revenues by $0.8 million. This indicates some instability in the company's revenue sources. The company also reported declines in organic revenue for international operations and mentioned that growth rates were adversely impacted. Additionally, there were uncertainties related to the impact of a settlement on customer response in the second half of the year. 

Overall, the company's financial performance, high debt levels, and uncertainties regarding revenue sources and customer response to a settlement suggest a cautious approach to investment in Stericycle. I would recommend closely monitoring the company's financial performance and reviewing future earnings calls before considering an investment in the company.
