### Future Outlook Report: Underweight Stance on Stericycle, Inc.

#### Executive Summary:
We recommend an "underweight" investment rating on Stericycle, Inc. based on our analysis of the company's financial performance as discussed in the recent earnings conference call for Q2. We have identified several concerns regarding growth sustainability, operational challenges, and potential financial risks that may pose threats to the investment value.

#### Financial Performance Review:
- **Revenue Trends**: Stericycle has shown a modest revenue increase of 2.9% year-over-year, reaching $917.7 million. While domestic and Canadian markets have shown acceptable growth (5.1% organically), international revenues have declined by 2.7% due to business exits and adverse market conditions.
  
- **Profitability Issues**: The company reported a significant net loss of $148.8 million, primarily attributed to costs related to a proposed class action settlement. Adjusted EBITA holds steady at 20% of revenues, aligning with guidance, but this does not mitigate concerns stemming from the net income loss.

- **Operational Metrics**: Gross profit margins remain relatively stable at 41.6%, but the company faces ongoing operational challenges, including manufacturing and industrial services underperformance and price concessions in the SQ market. These factors are likely to continue impacting bottom-line results.

#### Strategic Concerns:
- **Capital Allocation and Debt Management**: Stericycle's debt-to-EBITDA ratio stands at 3.46, raising concerns about its leverage levels despite plans for continued debt reduction. The use of cash for repurchasing shares amid these conditions needs close scrutiny concerning long-term financial health.

- **Guidance and Market Positioning**: The company's revised EPS guidance for FY2017 was lowered slightly at the top end, caused by various operational challenges and increased price concessions. This adjustment reflects potential uncertainty in achieving higher profitability targets.

- **Foreign Exchange and Market Volatility**: The company is exposed to foreign exchange volatility and has recently seen mixed effects on financial performance. Stericycle's strategy of not forecasting FX but adjusting based on actual rates could introduce additional variability into its financial outcomes.

#### Investment Risks:
- **Litigation Costs**: Ongoing litigation expenses related to the class action settlement are significant and may lead to further unforeseen financial burdens that could affect investor returns.
  
- **International Market Strategy**: Exiting key contracts and declining international revenue growth may undermine Stericycle's efforts to maintain a balanced geographic revenue stream, making it vulnerable to stagnation in core markets.

- **Technological Investments**: While necessary for long-term competitiveness, the investments in ERP systems and other technological upgrades will require significant capital expenditure and implementation risks.

#### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Stericycle presents several financial and operational risks that might not align with investors seeking stable and risk-mitigated returns. The company's current strategy and market performance, coupled with financial vulnerabilities, lead us to recommend an "underweight" stance, suggesting limited allocation in investment portfolios until clearer signs of sustainable performance improvements are evident. We will continue monitoring the companyâ€™s strategic execution and market conditions to adjust our recommendations as necessary.
