 target. On the capital return question, as it relates to M&A and share repurchases, again, we have a framework that we discussed at Investor Day. We have a capital return framework that has a bias for capital return given the excess capital generation and then with any excess over that level, we would go into M&A. And as it relates to share repurchase, it really depends on our tradeoffs around risk and return. We expect to be disciplined again in how we think about capital return and M&A. And so that's how we're thinking about those elements of our long-term EPS targets.

Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, key insights and financial metrics indicate that the company has achieved solid results ahead of prior expectations for the first quarter of 2017. The adjusted EPS guidance has been raised to at least $11.10, and the full year Retail pre-tax target has been increased by $50 million. Early indicators show better-than-anticipated prior-period development, and medical cost utilization trends are running well relative to pricing expectations. The company has lowered expectations around 2017 individual Medicare Advantage membership growth, but increased Group MA membership.

Additionally, the company is working diligently on Medicare Advantage bids for the 2018 plan year and is focused on maintaining pricing discipline. The Group and Specialty segment is performing in line with expectations, and the Healthcare Services segment is delivering profits and steady cash flow. The company also discussed long-term EPS targets of 11% to 15% and mentioned multiple levers that can be pulled to achieve these results, including membership and premium growth, MA margin changes, and capital return and M&A.

Based on these insights and financial metrics, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. While the company has achieved solid results and raised its EPS guidance, the lowered expectations for individual MA membership growth and the potential impact of the nondeductible health insurance fee (HIF) in 2018 present uncertainties for future profitability. Additionally, the company's long-term EPS targets may vary year-to-year, and there are potential risks associated with capital return and M&A decisions. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance is advisable until there is more clarity on the impact of these factors on the company's future performance.
