- **Progressive Quarterly EPS Growth:** The company anticipates the quarterly EPS to represent just under 30% of the full-year figure in both the second and third quarters, with a traditional increase in costs expected in the fourth quarter due to the open enrollment season.

### Strategic Initiatives and Long-Term Prospects
- **Medicare Advantage and Bid Strategies:** The company has strategically adjusted its Medicare Advantage (MA) membership growth projections and is focusing on enhancing its Group MA memberships. The preparation for 2018 MA plan year bids is in line with recent performance and market conditions, illustrating proactive management and sustainable growth planning.

The ongoing optimization of the Humana At Home initiative is ahead of schedule, providing a promising outlook for 2018 and beyond.

- **Effective Risk Management:** Despite a lowering in pharmacy volumes indicating reduced drug utilization, the management has effectively balanced this with other health plan profitability measures, ensuring overall financial stability.

- **Strong Governance and Leadership Transition:** With the planned retirement of the Vice President of Investor Relations and the introduction of a new leader with significant experience within the company, the firm is poised to maintain its strong investor relations and strategic communication.
