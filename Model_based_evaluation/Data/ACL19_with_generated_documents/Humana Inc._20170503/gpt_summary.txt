 targets that we've outlined. In addition, we continue to focus on increasing operational consistency and enhancing organizational productivity to achieve these results. As for the Medicare Advantage bids for the 2018 plan year, we are working diligently on our bid submissions, which are due in early June. We are incorporating our recent 2017 outperformance into our pricing and will reflect any new information as it becomes available in advance of the bid submissions. We are assuming the nondeductible health insurance fee, also known as the HIF, resumes in 2018 as is scheduled under current law. This will result in a reduction of benefits and/or increases in premiums for our members, which could create some member dislocation given the importance of stable premiums and benefits to member retention and new sales. Our bids will also reflect the outcome of our ongoing Stars bonus efforts with CMS, and we will update the Street on our progress in this regard during our second quarter conference call.

Overall, our performance in the first quarter of 2017 produced solid results ahead of our prior expectations. We have raised our adjusted EPS guidance to at least $11.10, and our full-year Retail pre-tax target by $50 million. The Retail segment outperformed our initial estimates, largely due to better-than-anticipated prior-period development, and we have lowered our expectations around 2017 individual MA membership growth while increasing Group MA membership. Our Group and Specialty segment and Healthcare Services segment are also having a good year and continue to deliver profits.

In terms of long-term EPS targets, our annual EPS target is 11% to 15%, reflecting our conviction around our strategy and the results it can deliver. Our results will vary year-to-year, sometimes performing above this range and other times falling within the range, depending on the funding environment, competitive landscape, and any prior year over-performance. We have multiple levers we can pull to achieve these long-term results, including membership growth, MA margin changes, pre-tax growth in excess of insurance membership growth, and capital return and M&A. We are also focused on increasing operational consistency and enhancing organizational productivity to achieve these results.

In summary, the first quarter of 2017 produced solid results for our company, and we have raised our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year. Our segment operating performance, including Retail, Group and Specialty, and Healthcare Services, is strong, and we are working diligently on our Medicare Advantage bids for the 2018 plan year. We remain focused on achieving our long-term EPS targets through various levers and organizational productivity. Additionally, we have undergone changes in our leadership, with Regina Nethery retiring and Amy Smith taking on the role of leading Investor Relations. We look forward to partnering with Amy in her new capacity. Thank you for your attention and we will now open the lines for questions.
