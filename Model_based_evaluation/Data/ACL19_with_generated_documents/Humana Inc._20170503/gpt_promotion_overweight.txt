Based on the recent earnings call, it is clear that the company has produced solid results ahead of prior expectations. Adjusted EPS guidance has been raised to at least $11.10 and the full year retail pre-tax target by $50 million. The company's retail segment outperformed initial estimates, with lower expectations around 2017 individual MA membership growth being offset by an increase in group MA membership. The Medicare Advantage bids for the 2018 plan year are also expected to position the company for stronger growth. Furthermore, the group and specialty segment is having another good year, and the healthcare services segment continues to deliver profits and steady cash flow. The long-term EPS targets of 11% to 15% growth were also discussed, with a focus on potential levers such as membership and premium growth, margin changes, and capital return. In addition, the retirement of the Vice President of Investor Relations was announced, with a new leader stepping into the role.

Overall, the company's strong performance and strategic outlook suggest a positive outlook for potential investors. The company has demonstrated consistent growth, and its focus on long-term EPS targets, strategic segments, and leadership transitions indicate a solid foundation for future success. Therefore, based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on the company.
