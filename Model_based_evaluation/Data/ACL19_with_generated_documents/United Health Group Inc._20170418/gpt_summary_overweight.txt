Dear colleagues,

In accordance with our recent earnings conference call transcript, I am presenting a summary report with an 'overweight' investment stance.

Key Financial Metrics:

1. Revenue Growth: Optum experienced significant organic revenue growth of $1.6 billion in the first quarter, leading to a 16% earnings growth rate on operations.

2. Operating Margins: The overall operating margins expanded to 6% in the first quarter, showcasing improved efficiency and profitability.

3. Business Expansion: OptumHealth served an additional 6 million people in the first quarter, with average per capita revenues growing by about 10%. OptumRx also achieved an above-market 5% growth rate in script fulfillment.

4. Revenue Backlog: OptumInsight's revenue backlog grew by 19%, adding $2.1 billion in the past 12 months, demonstrating a strong pipeline for future growth.

5. Strategic Partnerships: OptumRx was selected as a pharmacy care partner by the Health Transformation Alliance, representing Fortune 100 national employers, indicating potential multi-year growth opportunities.

Overall, UnitedHealth Group and Optum have demonstrated strong financial performance, with a focus on expanding customer base, efficiently managing operations, and forming strategic partnerships for future growth. As a financial analyst, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance based on these positive financial metrics and the potential for continued growth in the healthcare sector.

Thank you.

Best regards,
