 The company's Q1 performance reflects steady growth in revenue and earnings, particularly driven by the Performance and Security Solutions segment, which contributed over 60% of total revenue. The Cloud Security Solutions showed strong growth of 37% year-over-year and an annualized revenue run rate of $450 million. On the other hand, the Media Delivery Solutions segment experienced a revenue decline of 9% year-over-year, primarily due to a moderation of traffic growth in the Americas region and within the gaming vertical.

Overall, the company maintains a positive outlook for future growth, especially in the long-term prospects of the Media business, expecting acceleration in OTT areas as video content moves online. Additionally, the company's international markets, particularly in the Asia Pacific region, continue to show strong growth, presenting significant opportunities for expansion.

The company's strong balance sheet with roughly $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, provides financial flexibility for strategic investments, including share repurchases and acquisitions. The company expects to continue investing in new product innovation, service delivery enablement, and platform scaling to drive accelerated and sustainable long-term growth.

However, the company anticipates a near-term moderation in Media growth rates but remains confident in the prospects of the Media business, especially with the potential increase in online video traffic. The focus on maintaining a balance between top-line and bottom-line growth by investing in new adjacencies and innovation, even amidst near-term revenue moderation, reflects the company's commitment to long-term profitable growth.

In conclusion, the company remains bullish on its long-term profitable growth prospects, driven by its Performance and Security Solutions and the potential for acceleration in the Media business. While some near-term moderation is expected, the company's strong financial position and strategic investments position it as a compelling investment proposition for investors.
