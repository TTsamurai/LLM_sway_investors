To summarize, Akamai reported solid revenue and earnings in the first quarter, with strong revenue growth in Performance and Security Solutions, particularly in Cloud Security. Revenue from Media Delivery Solutions did show some decline, particularly in the Americas region and within the gaming vertical. Special attention was given to the international market, especially strong growth in Asia Pacific, while lower growth in Europe. Operating expenses were higher than expected due to increased recruiting-related spend and higher commissions. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was slightly lower than the previous quarter, and cash from operations remained solid. However, there is caution for the second quarter, with expected revenue moderation in the Media business, particularly in the Americas. Several significant investments are planned in new adjacencies, new product innovation, and service delivery, which could impact profitability in the near term. Guidance for the back half of 2017 is not provided, but a return to double-digit growth is expected in 2018.

The company also highlighted ongoing competition in the market, including competition from startups, traditional players, and cloud providers. Additionally, there are concerns about potential impact on revenue and margins from big broadcasters and carriers beginning to do more in-house content delivery and the potential decrease in quality levels for video delivery.

Overall, the report offers a cautious perspective on the company's future prospects, particularly in the short term, indicating that the investments in new areas may pressure margins, and the anticipated moderation of revenue growth in the Media business. This cautious stance recommends an 'underweight' investment stance based on the company's recent earnings call.
