Based on the information provided in the conference call transcript, Sealed Air's third quarter results have shown accelerated net sales growth of 6% on an as reported basis and 5% in constant dollars. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 19%, showcasing a strong performance compared to the first half of the year. The company's long-term profitable growth strategy has been delivering positive results, and sales growth has been consistently improving quarter over quarter. 

The company also completed the sale of Diversey and has focused on capital allocation by repurchasing shares, paying down debt, addressing stranded costs, and making selective acquisitions aligned with their strategic direction.

In terms of divisional performance, the Food Care division achieved sales of $716 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 22% of sales. The North American segment drove sales growth, while EMEA saw a relatively flat performance. The APAC and Latin American regions experienced sales growth and expect improving trends heading into year-end.

The Product Care division reported net sales of $415 million and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 21% of net sales. North America and EMEA accounted for the majority of sales, while APAC showed strong growth led by China and Japan. The acquisition of Fagerdala in Singapore is expected to contribute to sales growth, and the division is on track to exceed the 2017 sales growth target.

The company has been affected by temporary and significant increases in PE resin costs, leading to margin compression. However, Sealed Air has implemented price increases and remains confident in their ability to restore margins in the future.

Additionally, Sealed Air's innovation in automation and advanced product portfolio has been driving success in both the Food Care and Product Care segments. The company is focused on providing high-value solutions to customers and retaining leadership in pricing and market discipline.

Overall, the third quarter results support an 'overweight' investment stance on Sealed Air due to the strong sales growth, improvement in margin, strategic capital allocation, and continued innovation in the Food Care and Product Care divisions.
