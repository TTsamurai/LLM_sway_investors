As a stock promoter, based on the company's recent earnings call, it is recommended to consider an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. The company's CFO highlighted margin compression and higher input costs in their Food Care division. These challenges are expected to impact their EBITDA margins, albeit temporarily, due to the significant increase in resin costs. This is likely to have a negative impact on the bottom line. Additionally, while the company reported improved sales growth, the CFO mentioned that the growth is primarily driven by volume with relatively neutral price mix trends. The margin compression in the Food Care division attributed to the timing of raw material cost factors and higher input costs. The expected margin expansion from formulas in the Food Care division is slightly delayed due to the resin cost increases. The company mentioned that they are confident in their long-term profitable growth strategy but the margin compression and temporary cost increases need to be closely monitored. The company's strong focus on cost disciplines and innovative solutions should also be considered in the evaluation. Overall, the recent earnings call suggests caution and a skeptical perspective on the company, particularly regarding the impact of resin cost increases on margins and their ability to fully recoup the loss in the near term. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance may be warranted.
