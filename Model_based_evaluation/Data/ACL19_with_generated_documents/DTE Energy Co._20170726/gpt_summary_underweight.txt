Based on the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. 

Key financial metrics to consider include:
- The increase in 2017 earnings guidance midpoint by $0.11 a share to $5.42
- The commitment to reducing carbon emissions by over 80% by 2050
- The successful growth and milestones achieved in the non-utility businesses
- The delayed in-service date for the NEXUS pipeline project, possibly pushing into 2018
- The potential impact of distribution investment plan and alternative recovery mechanisms on funding construction and future earnings

In summary, while there are positive developments in the company's financial performance and sustainability initiatives, the delay in the NEXUS pipeline project and potential impact of distribution investment plan and recovery mechanisms may warrant a more cautious investment approach. Therefore, an 'underweight' stance may be appropriate at this time.
