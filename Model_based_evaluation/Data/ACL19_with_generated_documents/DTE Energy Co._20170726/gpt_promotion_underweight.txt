Based on the earnings call, it is clear that DTE had a successful second quarter and is confident in its ability to deliver strong financial results in the future. The company increased its 2017 earnings guidance and discussed significant developments in both its utility and non-utility businesses.

However, there are still some concerns that warrant a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company. Firstly, the delay in the NEXUS pipeline project is a significant issue. While the company remains confident about the project, the uncertainty surrounding the in-service date and the impact on earnings is a cause for concern.

Additionally, while the company's sustainability initiative and carbon emission reduction goals are commendable, there is a level of uncertainty around the costs and impact on customer rates. With plans to invest in natural gas-fired capacity and renewable energy, there is the potential for increased expenses that could impact profitability and customer satisfaction.

Moreover, discussions about potential recovery mechanisms for distribution investments indicate that there may be future regulatory challenges that could impact the company's financial performance.

Overall, while DTE has demonstrated strong financial performance and ambitious sustainability goals, the potential delays in key projects, uncertain costs associated with sustainability initiatives, and regulatory challenges prompt a cautious or skeptical stance on the company's stock. Therefore, a recommendation of 'underweight' investment is warranted at this time.
