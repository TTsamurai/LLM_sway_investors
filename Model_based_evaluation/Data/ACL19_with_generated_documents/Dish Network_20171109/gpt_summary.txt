Key financial metrics to focus on in the summary report include subscriber count, net additions or losses, churn rate, revenue adjustments due to hurricane impact, EBITDA pressure, ARPU and margin expansion, interest payments, taxes, and cash flow flexibility. The report should also address the impact of the hurricanes on revenue and expenses, as well as the company's plans for reactivating returning customers in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Additionally, it should discuss the company's focus on cash flow and cost initiatives to offset programming price increases, as well as plans for managing debt and maturities in the coming years. The report should provide a comprehensive assessment of the financial implications of the recent events on the company's operations and future prospects.
