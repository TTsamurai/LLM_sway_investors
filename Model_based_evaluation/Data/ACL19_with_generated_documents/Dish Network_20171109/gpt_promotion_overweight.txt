As a stock promoter, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company based on their recent earnings call. Despite the impact of Hurricane Maria, the company has shown resilience and adaptability in their subscriber base, growth in net Pay-TV subscribers in the 50 states, and focus on cash flow. They have proactively paused service for customers in areas affected by the hurricane, and are focused on disaster recovery efforts such as setting up satellite Internet at hospitals and FEMA registration sites. Additionally, the company expects to economically reconnect to the majority of their subscribers in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands over the next year, and do not expect the hurricane to have a material effect on their financial position or operating results. With their focus on cash flow and cost initiatives to offset programming price increases, as well as potential tax deductions and flexibility in paying off maturities, the company is well-positioned to navigate through the effects of the hurricane and continue to grow. Therefore, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended on this company.
