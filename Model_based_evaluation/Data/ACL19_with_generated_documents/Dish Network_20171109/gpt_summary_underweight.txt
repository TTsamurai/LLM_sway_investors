The recent earnings conference call for this company presents some concerning key financial metrics. The impact of Hurricane Maria on the company's subscriber base in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands has resulted in the removal of approximately 145,000 subscribers, leading to a decline of approximately 129,000 net pay-TV subscribers. 

Furthermore, the company expects to incur installation expenses in connection with reactivating returning customers, which will be recorded as gross new pay-TV subscriber activations. The company is also focused on disaster recovery efforts and aims to economically reconnect the majority of its subscribers in the affected areas over the next year. 

In terms of financial performance, the company has seen pressure in its DBS segment, and is focusing on acquiring and retaining higher quality subscribers in rural areas, as well as implementing cost initiatives to offset programming price increases. The company is also seeing margin expansion in its Sling TV segment and pivoting its dishNET segment from a wholesale model.

Considering these factors, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on this company due to the potential negative impact on its subscriber base and financial performance as a result of the hurricanes, as well as the pressures in its DBS segment. It is important to closely monitor the company's efforts in reactivating subscribers and cost initiatives to mitigate the impact of these challenges.
