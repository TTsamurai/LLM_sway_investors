Based on the information shared during the earnings call, there are several reasons to be cautious or skeptical about Allegion as an investment. 

Firstly, while the company reported strong revenue growth in the first quarter, it's important to note that much of this growth can be attributed to a favorable comparison with the prior year due to ERP implementation delays. This suggests that the growth may not be sustainable in the long term.

The company also faced currency headwinds in the EMEIA region, indicating potential challenges in international markets. Additionally, while the Americas region showed strong growth, the company's operations in EMEIA faced challenges associated with a restructuring plan to optimize manufacturing, delaying expected benefits.

Furthermore, the company experienced a decrease in available cash flow in the first quarter, largely due to a $50 million discretionary pension funding payment, as well as increases in working capital. This suggests potential liquidity constraints going forward.

Additionally, the company is facing significant commodity cost increases, particularly in steel, brass, and zinc, which are expected to continue to pressure their cost base in the next few quarters. While the company has implemented pricing actions to mitigate these impacts, it remains to be seen how successful these efforts will be, especially given competitive market conditions and the need for continued investment in new products and channels.

Overall, given the potential challenges and uncertainties highlighted in the earnings call, it may be prudent to recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on Allegion at this time.
