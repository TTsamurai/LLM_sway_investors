. We continue to expect some volatility in our transactional business due to macroeconomic conditions and the ongoing shift to the cloud. This is a key financial metric to consider as we adopt an 'underweight' investment stance. The impact of transactional revenue on overall revenue and operating income can be unpredictable, so it is essential to closely monitor these trends. We also need to focus on the impact of foreign exchange (FX) on total and segment level revenue, as well as the company's operating expenses. The 2-point negative impact of FX on total revenue, and the 2% decline in operating expenses, excluding LinkedIn, should be closely monitored for their potential impact on the company's financial performance. Additionally, we need to track the company's capital expenditures and other income and expense, as well as the non-GAAP effective tax rate.

Overall, the key financial metrics to focus on in the detailed summary report should include revenue, gross margin, operating income, earnings per share, commercial cloud revenue run rate, and commercial unearned revenue, as well as expenses, operating income growth, and investments in capital expenditures and dividends. Tracking these metrics will provide valuable insights into the company's financial performance and support the 'underweight' investment stance.
