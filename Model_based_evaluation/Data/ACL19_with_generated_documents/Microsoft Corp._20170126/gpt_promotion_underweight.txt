 in nature and doesn't necessarily have all that much to do with LinkedIn. I do think it is absolutely part of the growth we're seeing in that segment. So on our core and premium services, we are seeing that increasing usage, and as that translates into consumption, certainly a material driver of the CapEx growth that you see. And then as we look to these things – and I think this is part of your question on the full year – we do tend to expect that growth rates in CapEx to be lower than last year for the full year. I think some of the incidents we're already seeing out there of more efficient data center capacity and other new technologies contributing to that, as well as what we've talked about being the benefit we've seen as a company of all the cash repatriation we've been doing over the past two years. So you are seeing some of those benefits translate into fully burdened capital expenses. And we hope that continues to keep that growth rate down for the full year, and we're confident it is all for good. Thank you. 

Recommendation: Based on the details provided in the earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. While the company has shown growth in various segments, such as commercial cloud services, Office 365, and Dynamics, there are concerns over the impact of foreign exchange rates on total revenue. Additionally, the company's overall operating expenses and increased investment in cloud engineering, sales capacity, and developer engagement lead to a cautious outlook on future profitability. Considering the potential negative FX impact on total revenue for Q3 and Q4, it is advisable to approach investment in the company with caution.
