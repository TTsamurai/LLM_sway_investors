 and is also impacted by the addition of LinkedIn. Looking forward to next year, we do expect the CapEx growth rate to be lower than last year, but we will continue to meet customer demand and drive efficiencies through new technologies. Our focus will be to ensure that we are supporting all of our commercial and consumer services while keeping an eye on optimizing our capital expenditures.

In conclusion, based on the recent earnings call, the company has shown strong performance in its commercial cloud revenue, with a steady growth in its annuity mix and commercial bookings. The Intelligent Cloud segment has demonstrated solid momentum with double-digit annuity revenue growth, and the More Personal Computing segment has exceeded expectations, particularly in its OEM and search businesses. With a strong outlook for the company's commercial business and the expectation of continued growth in cloud services and annuity, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company continues to show strong performance and has a clear strategy for driving revenue growth, making it an attractive investment opportunity.
