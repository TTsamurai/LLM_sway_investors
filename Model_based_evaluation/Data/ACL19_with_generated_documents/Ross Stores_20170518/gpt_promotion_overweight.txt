Based on the information provided in the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company reported a 3% comparable store sales gain driven by increased traffic and average basket size, and a flat cost of goods sold. Merchandise margins improved by 15 basis points, while distribution and occupancy costs declined. Despite a 20 basis point increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses due to higher wages, the earnings per share for the quarter exceeded expectations and the company remains on track with its stock repurchase program.

Looking ahead, the company's second quarter guidance is positive, with forecasts of a 1-2% same-store sales increase and earnings per share of $0.73 to $0.76. Although operating margin is expected to be slightly down from the previous year due to higher freight and wage costs, the company's overall predicted earnings per share for the year is in the range of $3.07 to $3.17.

The company's regional performance was strong in the Southeast, Florida, and the Midwest, with California slightly below the chain average due to unfavorable weather. The company expects wages to abate in the second half of the year and remains confident in its outlook despite variability in carrier rates and fuel costs.

In conclusion, given the positive first quarter results, the favorable second quarter guidance, and the company's overall outlook for the year, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended for the company. With a solid track record and strategic management of cost pressures, the company's stock shows potential for profitable investment.
