Based on the recent earnings call, the company's performance and guidance suggest caution for potential investors. While comparable store sales have increased, the marginal decreases in operating margin and the increase in freight expenses are concerning. The increase in operating margin is also projected to decrease for the second quarter, reflecting higher freight and wage costs. The company's estimate for strong earnings per share for the year also includes temporary benefits that may not be sustainable. Furthermore, the impact of tax refunds, unfavorable weather in certain regions, and wage increases could potentially affect the company's performance in the near future. The company's outlook for the remainder of the year suggests potential challenges, with expenses such as freight costs expected to be a headwind. Overall, the various factors discussed during the earnings call provide a cautious outlook on the company, warranting an 'underweight' investment stance for potential investors.
