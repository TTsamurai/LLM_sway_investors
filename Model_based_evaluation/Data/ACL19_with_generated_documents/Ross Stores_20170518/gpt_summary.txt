Summary Report:

The company reported a 3% increase in comparable store sales, attributed to higher traffic and increased average basket size. Operating margin decreased slightly to 15.2% but exceeded expectations. Cost of goods sold remained flat, and merchandise margins improved. However, there was an increase in freight expenses and selling, general, and administrative expenses due to higher wages.

The company repurchased 3.3 million shares for a total of $215 million and plans to buy back a total of $875 million in stock for the year. Second-quarter guidance includes a 1-2% increase in same-store sales and earnings per share of $0.73 to $0.76. Operating margin is projected to be 13.9% to 14.1%, slightly down from the previous year.

The company anticipates earnings per share for the fiscal year ending February 3, 2018, to be in the range of $3.07 to $3.17, compared to $2.83 in the previous year.

During the quarter, sales strengthened as the quarter progressed, and Southeast, Florida, and the Midwest were top-performing regions. The delay in tax refunds and unfavorable weather in California affected performance.

Wages are expected to decrease in the second half of the year, and the company continues to expect SG&A leverage at about 3%. Merchandise margins are expected to remain relatively flat, and freight costs are anticipated to be a headwind for the remainder of the year.

The closures of stores in the quarter had a minimal impact, and the company expects fewer stores to create more market share opportunities. The company expects to update the back-half comp in August.

In conclusion, the company remains optimistic about its performance for the year and expects to address challenges such as freight expenses and wage costs in the second half. The update on the back-half comp in August will provide further insight into the company's performance.
