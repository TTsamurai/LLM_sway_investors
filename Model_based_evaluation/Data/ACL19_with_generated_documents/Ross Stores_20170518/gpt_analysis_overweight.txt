Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, the outlook for the company is quite positive. Comparable store sales were up 3%, driven by higher traffic and an increase in the average basket size. Despite a slight decrease in operating margin, the company's cost of goods sold was flat and merchandise margins improved, leading to an overall favorable earnings per share for the quarter.

The company also remains focused on a stock buyback program, with plans to repurchase a total of $875 million in stock for the year. This indicates confidence in the company's future prospects.

Looking ahead to the second quarter, the company forecasts a 1-2% increase in same-store sales and higher earnings per share compared to the previous year. However, second quarter operating margin is projected to be down slightly, partly due to forecasted higher freight costs and wage costs.

Despite these challenges, the company's full-year earnings per share outlook for 2018 is also positive, with a range of $3.07 to $3.17 compared to $2.83 last year.

Overall, based on the key insights and financial metrics from the recent earnings conference call, an 'overweight' investment stance for the company seems justified. The positive sales trends, stock buyback program, and earnings per share outlook all point to a favorable future outlook for the company.
