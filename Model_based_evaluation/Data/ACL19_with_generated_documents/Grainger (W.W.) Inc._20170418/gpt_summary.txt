In the recent earnings conference call, Grainger addressed their main focus on creating value for their customers by improving their pricing strategy. They have taken action to improve pricing in order to grow share with existing customers and attract new customers. The company is experiencing faster and stronger volume response to the pricing changes than anticipated. As a result, they have made the decision to accelerate their pricing actions, despite a large GP write-down in the short-term, which is expected to be accretive to earnings in the long-term.

Here are some key financial metrics discussed in the call:
- Revenue in the quarter was up 1%, with healthy volume up 5%.
- Gross profit and operating margin were impacted by pricing actions, resulting in a 14% decrease in operating earnings.
- Operating cash flow was up 13% driven mostly by working capital.
- Other businesses outside of the U.S. (including online models and businesses in LATAM, Europe, and China) performed as expected, with operating earnings for the segment up 45%.
- In the U.S., sales were down 1%, but volume was up 4% driven entirely by price. The company has implemented pricing actions to support large customers consolidating their purchases and has seen positive results from the changes in volume growth.

The company is focused on accelerating growth and improving margins, expecting to be back on track to hit their 2019 guidance of an operating margin of 12% to 13%. They are also committed to managing expenses and driving productivity to achieve their forward-looking goals. The decision to accelerate pricing actions has the potential to change their trajectory and get back to their long-term operating margin guidance by 2019.

Despite the challenges and complexities of the changes, Grainger is confident in their strategy and is committed to creating a flawless customer experience. They are anticipating significant changes in their cost structure, particularly in the U.S., and expect to overcommunicate with stakeholders about the progress and results of their pricing strategy and cost management.

Ultimately, Grainger is confident that the pricing acceleration will allow them to be more aggressive in marketing efforts, drive market share gains, accelerate customer retention efforts, and gain back the spot buy volume. The company is focused on creating a strong and sustainable platform for future growth, even though the pricing changes may have short-term impacts on earnings. They are aligned as a team and fully committed to making this strategy work for the long-term success of the business.
