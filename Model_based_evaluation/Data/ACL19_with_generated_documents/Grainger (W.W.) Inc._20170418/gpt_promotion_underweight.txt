Based on the transcript of the recent earnings call, it is evident that the company is making significant changes to its pricing structure in order to address customer dissatisfaction and stimulate growth. The company has experienced slower than expected volume response to these pricing changes and is now accelerating the pricing actions. While this may positively impact the long-term profitability of the company, it is expected to have a significant impact on short-term earnings. The company also expects to face challenges in managing expense reduction and driving productivity to achieve long-term goals.

The revenue and gross profit of the company were impacted by the pricing actions, resulting in a decline in operating earnings. The volume response to the pricing changes was faster and more immediate than anticipated, which led to the decision to accelerate pricing actions in 2017. While this may lead to improved customer retention and acquisition, it is expected to have a significant short-term impact on the company's earnings.

Furthermore, the company's cost structure and expense reduction efforts are highlighted as key factors in achieving long-term profitability. The company expects to see improvements in service levels and cost structure, particularly in the Canadian market, as well as continued investment in eCommerce capabilities and physical distribution.

Despite the challenges ahead, the company remains committed to creating a flawless customer experience and believes that the pricing acceleration and cost leverage will drive future growth and profitability. It is important to note that the company's decision to accelerate pricing actions represents a significant shift in strategy and may pose risks to short-term earnings.

Overall, the cautious or skeptical perspective on the company recommends an 'underweight' investment stance based on the uncertainties and challenges highlighted in the recent earnings call. The expected short-term impact of the accelerated pricing actions and the need for significant cost reduction to achieve long-term goals warrant a cautious approach to investing in the company.
