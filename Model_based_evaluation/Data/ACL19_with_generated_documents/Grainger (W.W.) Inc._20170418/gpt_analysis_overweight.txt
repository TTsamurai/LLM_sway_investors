Based on the insights and financial metrics from the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for Grainger. The company has taken significant actions to improve pricing in response to customer dissatisfaction, and these actions have yielded a faster and stronger volume response than anticipated. The decision to accelerate pricing actions, although involving a large GP write-down in the short-term, is expected to be accretive to earnings over the long-term.

Key financial metrics include a 1% increase in revenue, a healthy 5% volume growth, and a 13% increase in operating cash flow. Non-U.S. businesses, including the online model, performed as expected and delivered strong sales growth. The company's focus on cost productivity and expense management has also demonstrated positive momentum.

Furthermore, Grainger's decision to introduce web pricing and launch digital marketing efforts under the Grainger brand are expected to accelerate customer acquisition and retention, simplify the pricing structure, and improve operating margins. The company also plans to continue cost leverage initiatives to align with its long-term operating margin guidance.

The change in the pricing strategy, although challenging, is expected to create a more competitive position for Grainger, improve customer experience, and drive sustainable long-term growth. The company is confident in its ability to deliver strong financial results by 2019 and is committed to executing the necessary changes.

Overall, the company's strategic pricing actions, focus on cost management, growth in online businesses, and drive to enhance customer experience provide a compelling investment opportunity. Therefore, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended based on the company's long-term growth potential and solid financial performance.
