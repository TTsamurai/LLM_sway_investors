Based on the insights and financial metrics derived from the recent earnings conference call transcript, here are some reasons for adopting an 'underweight' investment stance:

1. Pricing Actions Impact: The company has implemented significant pricing actions, resulting in a fast, immediate, and stronger volume response than anticipated. This includes price changes for large customers and the introduction of web pricing for a large SKU assortment. These pricing changes have led to both positive and negative impacts on the company's volume and overall performance. This acceleration in pricing actions has led to a large GP write-down in the short-term.

2. Operating Margin Impact: The operating margins were significantly impacted by the pricing actions, leading to a decline in operating earnings. The impact on gross margins and operating expenses in the U.S. and Canada, as a result of these pricing changes, has been detrimental to the company's financial performance.

3. Long-Term Sustainability and Profitability: The company is making strategic decisions to accelerate its pricing actions in order to achieve sustainable long-term growth. The management is confident that these actions, while challenging, are necessary for the long-term success of the business. They are committed to creating a better customer experience and driving volume growth through competitive pricing, digital marketing, and improved cost structure.

4. Competitive Landscape: Despite the pricing actions, the company remains cautious about the competitive landscape and the impact on customer behavior. The focus on customer mix and the need to maintain a competitive advantage through eCommerce and physical distribution capabilities is critical for future growth and profitability.

5. Guidance and Expectations: The management has adjusted its guidance to account for the impact of the accelerated pricing actions on the company's trajectory. However, they express confidence in achieving their long-term operating margin guidance by 2019, emphasizing the need for continued cost leverage and productivity improvement.

In summary, the recent pricing actions and their impact on the company's financial performance, uncertainty about customer response, and the need for sustained cost leverage and productivity improvement, are reasons to exercise caution in investing in this company, hence an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended.
