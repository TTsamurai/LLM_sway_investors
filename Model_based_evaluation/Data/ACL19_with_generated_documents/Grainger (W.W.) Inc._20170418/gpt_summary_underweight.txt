Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the Company. The focus is on key financial metrics such as revenue, gross profit, operating margin, operating expenses, and operating cash flow. 

The quarter's revenue was up 1%, attributed to healthy volume growth at 5%. However, the gross profit and operating margin were significantly impacted by pricing actions, resulting in a 14% decline in operating earnings. Operating cash flow increased by 13%, primarily due to working capital. 

Other business segments performed as expected, with online businesses showing strong sales growth and operating margin expansion. In Canada, sales increased by 1% in local currency, but the gross margin declined by 270 basis points, impacting operating expenses. The company aims to break even in Canada by the end of 2017 and improve service levels, pricing actions, and cost structure. 

In the U.S., sales were down 1%, but volume grew by 4% driven by strategic pricing actions. The company adjusted list prices to support large customers consolidating their purchases, which resulted in an immediate volume response and positive customer feedback. 

The company plans to accelerate pricing actions, including introducing web prices for the entire assortment and eliminating the opt-in requirement, adding digital marketing, and accelerating large contract customer negotiations. The pricing acceleration will lead to a large GP write-down in the short-term but is expected to be accretive to earnings over the long-term and allow the company to achieve its operating margin guidance by 2019.

Despite challenges, the company continues to focus on creating value and has a strong commitment to executing the necessary changes to accelerate growth and return to profitability. Overall, while the company is confident about its changes, the challenging nature of the market and the drastic changes in pricing strategy suggest a cautious approach, warranting an 'underweight' investment stance.
