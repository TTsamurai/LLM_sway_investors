Based on the recent earnings call, the company is focused on creating value for customers by improving pricing and leveraging digital capabilities for customer acquisition and growth. The accelerated pricing actions taken by the company have resulted in faster, more immediate, and stronger volume response than anticipated. The focus on adjusting list prices, introducing web prices for a large portion of SKUs, and negotiating large customer contracts with updated pricing structure has led to positive results. The company has experienced the strongest volume growth in two years, with expectations of 6% volume growth in the U.S. for the year.

The company plans to accelerate pricing actions in 2017, including introducing web prices on the entire assortment of SKUs, adding digital marketing under the Grainger brand, and accelerating large contract customer negotiations. These actions are expected to speed up customer retention efforts, accelerate customer acquisition, and aid in simplifying the pricing structure and lowering expenses.

The company anticipates that the pricing acceleration will allow them to change trajectory and get back to their long-term operating margin guidance by 2019. While there will be an impact in the short term, the company expects to eliminate a significant barrier for customers and become more competitive in the market. It is also confident that the price changes will translate into volume growth, improved customer acquisition, and a better customer experience.

The company also intends to continue on the cost leverage path and improve cost structure to achieve their forward-looking goals. The management is confident that the business is making the right decisions for long-term success and is committed to executing the necessary changes needed to accelerate growth and profitability.

Overall, the recent positive results from the pricing actions and the strategic focus on customer acquisition, volume growth, and cost structure improvement make the company attractive for investing from an 'overweight' perspective. The long-term sustainable platform for future growth and the commitment to creating a flawless customer experience are key factors contributing to this investment stance.
