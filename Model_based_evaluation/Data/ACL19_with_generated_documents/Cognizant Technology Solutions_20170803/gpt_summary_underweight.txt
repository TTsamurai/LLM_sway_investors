 before we move to the summary of the financial metrics and the 'underweight' investment stance.

Summary:
- Cognizant is investing in industry-specific solutions, such as next-gen sales platform for consumer product companies and digital automation fabric for workflow automation.
- The company's financial performance in banking and financial services has been impacted by conservative spending and cost optimization by large money center banks.
- Healthcare segment has seen healthy demand, with a shift towards value-based care models and pent-up demand from M&A activity.
- Products and Resources and Communications, Media and Technology segments have shown strong growth.
- Geographically, Europe saw growth after negative currency impact, and rest of the world, particularly Asia-Pacific markets, showed strong growth.
- The company is also investing in building and retaining talent, with initiatives such as educational partnerships and workforce development programs.
- Overall, there are challenges in the large money center banking sector and uncertainty in healthcare due to the future of the ACA, which could lead to a conservative investment stance.

Considering the challenges in the banking sector and uncertainty in healthcare, the financial metrics do not indicate strong growth potential, leading to an 'underweight' investment stance on Cognizant.
