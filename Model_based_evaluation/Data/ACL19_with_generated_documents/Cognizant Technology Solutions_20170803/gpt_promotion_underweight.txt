Based on the recent earnings call by Cognizant, the focus on digital transformation and the development of industry-specific solutions is a positive sign for the company's growth potential. However, there are still some cautious factors to consider.

Firstly, the company's performance in the banking and financial services sector, particularly with large money-center banks, has been challenged. These banks are taking a conservative approach to spending and are focused on cost optimization, which could impact Cognizant's revenue in this segment.

Additionally, there is continued uncertainty in the healthcare sector, specifically related to the future of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). While Cognizant has heavily invested in its healthcare practice and is well-positioned to meet evolving client demand, the uncertainty surrounding the ACA could potentially impact the company's healthcare revenue.

Overall, despite the positive growth in other business segments and geographic regions, the challenges in the banking and financial services sector and the uncertainty in healthcare warrant a cautious or 'underweight' investment stance on Cognizant at this time.
