Based on the insights and financial metrics provided in the earnings conference call transcript, here is an analysis and future outlook for the company with an 'underweight' investment stance:

1. Core FFO: The company reported core FFO of $0.84 per share for the second quarter, which exceeded their guidance due to higher real estate values and promote income. This indicates strong performance in the quarter.

2. Occupancy: The global occupancy at the end of the quarter was 96.2%, a sequential decrease of 40 basis points. This decrease in occupancy reflects the company's strategy to push rents, which may lead to a modest decline in occupancy.

3. Same-Store NOI Growth: The company reported same-store NOI growth of 4.6%, primarily driven by leasing spreads. However, they expect leasing volumes to be slower in the second half of the year.

4. Capital Deployment: The company had the highest quarterly level of development starts in several years, with margins on starts and stabilizations exceeding 20%. Additionally, they completed dispositions and contributions, streamlining their ventures into more profitable vehicles.

5. Guidance for 2017: The company increased its guidance for year-end occupancy, same-store NOI growth, and deployment. They also expect strong demand from customers and increased market rents to drive strong NOI growth for the next several years.

Based on this analysis, the company's strong performance and positive outlook for the future indicate the potential for continued growth. However, the modest decline in occupancy and slower leasing volumes in the second half of the year may pose some challenges. Given these factors, an 'underweight' investment stance is advised, as there may be potential risks that could impact the company's performance in the near term. Investors should carefully evaluate the company's future performance and monitor the impact of their leasing strategies on occupancy and NOI growth before considering an overweight investment stance.
