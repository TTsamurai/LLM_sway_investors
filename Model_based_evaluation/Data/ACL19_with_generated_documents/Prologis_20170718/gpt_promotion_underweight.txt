Based on the company's recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. The company's current strategy of pushing rents to maximize lease economics has led to a modest decline in occupancy, which is concerning for future earnings growth. Additionally, the company's increased deployment guidance and acquisitions may impact future cash flows and earnings. The company's focus on streamlining ventures into fewer, more profitable vehicles may pose risks in terms of diversification and exposure to specific markets. The company's projection of 2017 core FFO does not appear to fully account for the potential risks and uncertainties in the market. Overall, the company's performance and future outlook may not justify a favorable investment stance at this time.
