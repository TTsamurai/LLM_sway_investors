Based on the recent earnings call, the company had a strong second quarter performance with core FFO of $0.84 per share, exceeding guidance due to higher real estate values in the portfolio. The company also experienced strong market rent growth and same-store NOI growth of 4.6%. They also made significant capital deployment with development starts at the highest level in several years and strategic acquisitions.

The company's balance sheet is strong with liquidity of $3.7 billion and significant built-in capital for future deployment. They also have access to global debt at attractive rates and leverage is approximately 25% on a market capitalization basis. The company is increasing its 2017 core FFO by $0.05 at the midpoint and nearing the range between $2.78 and $2.82 per share.

The company's guidance for the year includes an increase in year-end occupancy forecast to be between 96.5% and 97%, same-store NOI growth of approximately 5%, and cash same-store NOI growth of over 6%. They are also increasing their starts guidance and disposition and contribution guidance for the year.

The company expects cap rates to modestly decline in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, leading to higher valuations for assets. They also anticipate higher rent growth to drive NOI growth in the future.

Overall, based on the strong performance and positive outlook, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. Their strategic acquisitions, strong balance sheet, and projected NOI growth make them an attractive investment opportunity.
