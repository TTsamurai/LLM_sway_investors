. Danielle, our store staffing model has shown flexibility in terms of hours and spend rate. Our outlook for store payroll includes our expectation that wages will continue to be a headwind at those higher levels. We're anticipating that wages will be a 20 basis point headwind in Q1 and 10 basis points for the year. And then I think in the past we've talked about, we would expect wages to moderate off of 2015 and 2016, but we still expect our elevated levels to be higher in 2017 compared to 2016. On direct imports, Leonard, as we've said in the past, direct imports are very small for us. Also worth noting, as we've said during previous calls, direct imports have no real direct exposure to countries that produce a meaningful portion of our merchandise. So any direct import exposure is relatively minimal and not really currently a meaningful exposure for us. I'll expand on it. So historically, we've said that the benefit of wages to sales moderates as we anniversaried the significant wage rate increases. For guidance, we factored in these wage increases as well as future increases that are included in our guidance numbers. We expect that wages will continue to be a headwind as wage rates increase compared to last year. This comparison reflects not only the initial increase to $10 an hour that we anniversaried in March of 2016, but our incremental wage rate increases rolling through 2017, as well as minimum wage increases in a number of states. Sure, Danielle. So we expect a couple of things. First, low single-digit direct store inventories, and store productivity should be fairly flat â€“ certainly not a big drag as we've continually refined how we manage our inventory. By adjusting our allocations and refining our in-store processes and plan, we've reduced store inventories 4-to-5 years running even as sales have grown dramatically over the same period. In general, we have much greater confidence to manage our inventories and keep our in-store selections fresh regardless of how sales perform. An important component of that progress is our ongoing efforts to shorten the supply chain. And in general, we expect modest inventory improvement. On the debt side, as we said, that has given us a lot of flexibility to manage share count. Yet at the same time, it's important for us to maintain a strong balance sheet. We've always said we would not compromise in anyway from our regular practice of generating significant amount of operating cash. The ongoing strength in our balance sheet is reflected in our $670 million of cash and investments which allows us to be committed to meaningful share repurchase programs and significant increases in our dividend. Thank you.
