, thank you. With all of this information in mind, I would recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company based on the recent earnings call. The company's fourth quarter results show an increase in comparable store sales driven by higher traffic and an increase in the size of the average basket. Additionally, the company's operating margins increased by 90 basis points. There was also a significant stock buyback program, with a total of 11.6 million shares repurchased for an aggregate price of $700 million in 2017. The guidance for 2017 forecasts an increase in earnings per share and total sales, and the addition of new store locations. While there may be potential headwinds in the first quarter, the company has historically delivered excess cash to shareholders and is maintaining a strong balance sheet. With a clear strategy for deployment of cash and a strong performance in key regions, I believe the company is positioned for continued success and growth. Therefore, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company.
