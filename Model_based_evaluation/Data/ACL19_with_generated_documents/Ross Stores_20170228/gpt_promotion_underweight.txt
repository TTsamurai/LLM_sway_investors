As the stock promoter, I would recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company based on their recent earnings call. While there were improvements in operating margins and a stock buyback program, there are several factors to consider.

- Cost of goods sold improved, but there was a 15 basis point increase in freight costs and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. This may impact overall margins and profitability.

- The guidance for 2017 projects a relatively flat inventory level and a challenging and promotional retail environment, which may impact sales and margin growth.

- Earnings per share for the first quarter are forecasted to decline, mainly due to higher wage and freight costs.

- The company is projecting a decline in EBIT margin for the first quarter and overall for the year, which may indicate challenges in maintaining profitability.

- The company's tax rate is expected to be approximately 37% to 38%, which may impact overall earnings and cash flow.

- Capital expenditures for 2017 are projected to be approximately $400 million, which may impact cash flow and dividend payouts to shareholders.

Overall, these factors suggest that the company may face challenges in maintaining or improving profitability in the near future, leading to an 'underweight' investment stance.
