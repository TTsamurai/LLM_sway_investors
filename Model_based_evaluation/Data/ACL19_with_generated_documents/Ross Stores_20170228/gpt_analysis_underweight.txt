Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript for the company, it is evident that there are both positive and negative financial metrics to consider. The 4% comparable store sales gain driven by higher traffic and larger average basket size is a positive indicator. The improvement in operating margins and cost of goods sold is also a positive. However, there are concerning factors such as the increase in freight costs, higher wages impacting SG&A expenses, and a projected decline in EBIT margin for the first quarter of 2017.

The company's guidance for fiscal 2017 forecasts an increase in earnings per share by 7% to 11%, primarily attributed to a 53rd week and a lower tax rate. The projected total sales growth of 6% to 7% and new store openings are positive signs for expansion. However, the expected decline in EBIT margin for the first quarter and the full year is a cause for concern.

The company's stock buyback program and dividend announcements reflect a commitment to delivering excess cash to shareholders, but the impact of anticipated headwinds such as higher freight costs and wages on operating margins cannot be overlooked.

Given the overall mixed financial metrics and guidance provided in the conference call transcript, it would be prudent to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. This stance is based on the potential challenges in maintaining operating margins and the impact of projected headwinds on financial performance. It is recommended to closely monitor the company's performance and re-evaluate the investment stance as the year progresses.
