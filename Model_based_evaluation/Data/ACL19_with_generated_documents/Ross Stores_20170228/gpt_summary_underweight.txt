Based on the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on this company. 

Key financial metrics to consider for this recommendation include:

1. Comparable Store Sales: The 4% gain in comparable store sales is positive, indicating higher traffic and an increase in the average basket size. However, it is important to assess the sustainability of this growth trend.

2. Operating Margins: The 90 basis points increase in operating margins to 13.6% in the fourth quarter is a positive sign, but the forecasted decline in first quarter operating margins to 14.7% to 14.9% compared to last year's 15.4% should be closely monitored.

3. Stock Buyback Program: The completion of a $1.4 billion stock repurchase program raises questions about future capital allocation and the company's strategic use of cash.

4. Earnings Guidance: The forecasted earnings per share for fiscal 2017 to be $3.02 to $3.15 is in line with a 7% to 11% increase from fiscal 2016. However, the impact of the 53rd week and the lower tax rate related to the new share-based payment accounting standard should be scrutinized.

5. Capital Expenditures: The projected $400 million capital expenditure in 2017, representing an increase from 2016, should be evaluated for its potential impact on future profitability and returns to shareholders.

6. Inventory Management: The stability expected in inventory levels going forward should be assessed for its effectiveness in supporting sales and profitability.

Considering the mixed performance indicators and uncertain external factors such as tax policies and a challenging retail environment, it is prudent to adopt a cautious investment stance on the company. Further analysis and monitoring of key financial metrics are recommended to evaluate the company's future performance and growth prospects.
