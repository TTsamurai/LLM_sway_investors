# **Future Outlook Report: Underweight Investment Stance**

## **Executive Summary:**
After thorough analysis of the conference call transcripts detailing fiscal 2017 and Q1 2017 earnings outlook, we recommend an underweight position on the stock due to concerns over the sustainability of the company’s top-line growth, margin pressures, and the challenging environment projected for the retail sector.

## **1. Financial Performance Review:**
From its fourth quarter earnings, the company reported a 4% increase in comparable store sales driven by heightened traffic and larger basket sizes. Operating margins improved modestly by 90 basis points to 13.6%, primarily due to reduced distribution expenses and slightly improved merchandise margins. However, it's important to highlight the increase in freight costs and SG&A expenses which could signal rising cost pressures, a trend that if continued, may squeeze future profitability.

### **Concerns on Operating Leverage:**
The management expects to face continued wage growth pressure throughout 2017, particularly in the first half, which will likely compress SG&A efficiency. Furthermore, with freight costs rising due to higher carrier rates, the company might see additional strain on its operating margins.

## **2. Sales and Growth Outlook:**
For fiscal 2017, the guidance projects an EPS increase of 7% to 11%, including minor tailwinds from a 53rd week and a reduced tax rate. Though total sales are expected to grow between 6% to 7%, this is largely augmented by the extra week with same-store sales expected to rise only 1% to 2%. This modest growth in core sales activity, in conjunction with relatively flat merchandise margins, suggests potential stagnation in the company's growth trajectory.

### **Store Expansion and CapEx Concerns:**
The company plans to open 90 new stores but will also close or relocate ten existing locations. A higher capex forecast of $400 million, increasing from the lower spend in recent years, indicates intense capital allocation towards new store openings, refreshes, and technology upgrades. The requirement for heavier investments to drive footfall or improve operational efficiency underscores potential concerns about organic growth within existing store formats.

## **3. Macro and Sector Challenges:**
Beyond company-specific issues, broader retail sector trends could impact performance. A promotional and challenging retail environment is likely to persist, as indicated by the flat expectations for merchandise margins and ongoing pressures from higher freight and wage costs. The retail sector's volatility, while possibly advantageous for pricing strategies, also introduces significant unpredictability to earnings stability.

## **4. Stock Buyback and Dividend Policy:**
While the completion of a $1.4 billion stock repurchase program and the announcement of dividend increases reflect strong cash flow generation and shareholder return focus, these actions also suggest limited opportunities for reinvestment into transformative growth initiatives. This may not necessarily align with long-term value creation, especially in a rapidly evolving retail landscape.

## **Conclusion and Investment Stance:**
Given the forecast of limited comparable store sales growth, rising operational costs, and the challenging macroeconomic conditions facing the retail industry, we adopt an underweight stance on the stock. The company’s focus on expanding its store count and implementing technological upgrades, while necessary, might not sufficiently mitigate the risks of deteriorating margins and heightened competitive pressures. Investors should be cautious, weighing the potential for modest earnings growth against the backdrop of significant operational and sector-specific challenges.
