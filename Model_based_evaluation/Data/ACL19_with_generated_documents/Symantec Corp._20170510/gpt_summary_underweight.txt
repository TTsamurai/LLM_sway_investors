Based on the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that Symantec has made substantial improvements in its financial performance, particularly in its Enterprise Security and Consumer Security segments. Key financial metrics to consider when adopting an 'underweight' investment stance include:

1. Enterprise Security - Strong improvement in profitability, with operating margins up 17 points year over year in Q4 fiscal year 2017. Moreover, the company is forecasting exiting fiscal year 2018 with over 30% enterprise operating margins.

2. Consumer Security - Exceeded the high end of revenue guidance on an organic basis, with LifeLock performing above revenue expectations and showing strong underlying growth metrics.

3. Cost Savings and Synergies - The company is achieving cost savings and synergies at a faster pace than originally anticipated and is ahead of plan exiting fiscal year 2017.

4. Financial Outlook - The company is forecasting mid-single digits organic revenue growth for each of its segments, with total organic revenue growth for the company in the mid-single digits. Non-GAAP operating margins are expected to be over 35% by the end of fiscal year 2018.

5. Transformation and Operational Commitments - Symantec is focused on fundamentally transforming its business across both revenue growth and increased profitability. The company is entering the year with significant operational improvements in its go-to-market processes and has simplified demand chain and programs to its partners, reducing substantial complexity across the business.

In conclusion, while Symantec has shown strong financial performance and improvement, an 'underweight' investment stance may be warranted due to concerns about potential headwinds in the industry, competitive pressures, and uncertainty around the implementation of the proposed initiatives and forecasts. Additionally, the company's financial outlook is subject to market conditions and potential execution risks. Therefore, caution is advised when considering investment in Symantec.
