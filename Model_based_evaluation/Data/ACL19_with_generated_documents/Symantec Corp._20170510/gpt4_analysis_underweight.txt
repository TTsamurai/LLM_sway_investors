The company has undergone significant transformations intended to align with the growing cloud-based security demands and expand its consumer digital safety offerings.

#### Recent Performance and Financial Highlights

#### Segment Analysis:
1. **Enterprise Security**: Showed a 2% organic growth with particularly strong performance in cloud security driven by an increase in cloud subscription and virtual appliance sales. The segment achieved a 13% operating margin in FY 2017, significantly up from 5% in FY 2016.
2. **Consumer Security**: The segment exceeded revenue expectations, largely driven by the LifeLock acquisition. Renewal rates and new product offerings like Norton Mobile protection contributed to the growth.

#### Risks and Challenges:
- **Increased Competition**: The cybersecurity market is intensely competitive with many players offering overlapping capabilities. Symantec’s significant reliance on continuous product innovation and market acceptance of its integrated platforms could pose risks.
- **Operational Integration**: While Symantec has made headway in integrating acquisitions and aligning its sales force, the complexity of fully realizing synergies and optimizing cost savings remains a considerable challenge.
- **Market Adaptation to Cloud**: The rapid pace of technological change and customer migration to cloud environments necessitates swift adaptation by Symantec. Delays or missteps could impact market share and revenue growth.
- **Certificate Authority Business**: Ongoing disputes and proposed changes by Google regarding certificate authority operations may influence trust and marketability of Symantec’s security solutions.

#### Financial Metrics:
- **Deferred Revenue**: Increases in deferred revenue point to robust future financial health but also imply a significant dependency on future performance to meet current valuations.
- **Profit Margin**: Enterprise Security operating margins are anticipated to exceed 30% by the end of FY 2018, a crucial metric indicating improved efficiency and profitability.

#### Conclusion:
Given the volatile nature of the cybersecurity market and the operational challenges faced by Symantec, an 'underweight' stance is recommended for conservative investors. While the company is strategically positioned with leading technologies and has shown a commendable turnaround in profitability, uncertainties in achieving long-term sustainable growth amidst fierce competition and operational integration complexities could hinder expected returns relative to market alternatives. Investors should closely monitor Symantec’s execution of its integration strategies, market adoption of its enterprise solutions, and management of emerging challenges related to its Certificate Authority business before reevaluating this stance.
