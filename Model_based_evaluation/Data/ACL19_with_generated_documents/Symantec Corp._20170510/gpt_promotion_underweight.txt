Based on the recent earnings call, it is clear that Symantec has seen improvements in their enterprise and consumer businesses. The company has reported strong business activity and revenue growth in both segments. However, there are several points to consider before making an investment decision.

Firstly, while the company has reported positive results, it is important to note the cautious approach to the fiscal year 2018 outlook. While Symantec's leadership has highlighted achievements and progress, the company's CFO has emphasized the need for careful consideration when evaluating future growth. This suggests that there may be challenges ahead that could impact the company's performance.

Furthermore, the company's transformation plans and commitments to cost savings and synergies are highlighted as key drivers for future profitability. However, these plans are ongoing and it is essential to monitor their progress over the coming quarters.

Additionally, the competitive landscape for Symantec's products, especially in the endpoint security and cloud security space, is rapidly evolving. While the company has seen success in these areas, there is a risk of increased competition and technological advancements from other players in the market.

Another factor to consider is the company's focus on consumer digital safety, specifically its efforts to transition and bundle offerings for loyal Norton customers. While the company is optimistic about the potential for growth in this area, there may be challenges in execution and adoption by customers.

In conclusion, while Symantec has demonstrated positive results and progress, there are underlying factors that warrant a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company's future performance. Therefore, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance until there is more clarity on the company's ability to navigate potential challenges and deliver sustainable growth and profitability.
