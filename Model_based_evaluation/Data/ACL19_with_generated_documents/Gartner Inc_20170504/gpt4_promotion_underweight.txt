**Analytical Report: Underweight Recommendation for Gartner, Inc.**

**1. Overview of Financial Performance:**

Gartner, Inc. reported a year-over-year growth in revenues and contract value, driven primarily by strategic acquisitions such as L2 and the recent CEB integration. While the Research segment displayed robust growth, the overall financial performance exhibits areas of concern, particularly within the Consulting and Events segments.

**2. Concerns Over Consulting Segment:**

The Consulting segment's performance has been tepid, with a reported year-on-year revenue growth of only 2%. Even more worrisome is the backlog in this segment, which saw a decline of 9% on an FX-neutral basis. This indicator of future revenue generation reflects potential weaknesses in the pipeline, which could impact future revenues negatively.

**3. Underperformance and Margin Pressure in Events:**

The Events segment, although growing at 11% on an FX-neutral basis, experienced a significant reduction in the gross contribution margin by about 200 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2016. Such margin pressure, especially in a growth segment, is concerning because it could imply rising costs that may not be sufficiently offset by revenue increases in future quarters.

**4. Elevated SG&A Expenses:**

The Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) expenses have risen by 18% year-over-year, which is substantial and outpaces revenue growth. This increase is partly attributed to expansion such as in sales force, but if not managed carefully, can eat into the company’s profitability.

**5. Integration Risks and Uncertainties from Recent Acquisitions:**

The substantial integration of CEB adds complexity and potential execution risks. Integration charges and increased depreciation reflect higher than normal costs, which could impact profitability if synergies do not materialize as expected. Moreover, changes in management structures and harmonization of systems could present further operational challenges.

**6. High Leverage and Cash Flow Concerns:**

Post-acquisition, the company’s gross debt increased significantly, raising leverage to a level that may concern some investors. The net debt position post the CEB acquisition implies a leverage ratio of about 4.3 times adjusted EBITDA. Moreover, operating cash flow witnessed a decline, moving from a $13 million inflow to a $30 million outflow year-over-year. While management claims this is a result of timing, such fluctuations warrant close monitoring.

**7. Forward Guidance and Market Positioning:**

While the company provides a stable guidance and expects accretive EPS growth from the CEB acquisition, the underlying softness in segments like Consulting, coupled with cost pressures and heavy investment requirements, could potentially dilute the expected benefits. The transitioning market and high competitive intensity also add layers of uncertainty to this outlook.

**8. Conclusion:**

Given the above analysis, which underscores concerns ranging from segment-specific underperformance to financial leveraging and integration risks, an underweight position is recommended. Investors should closely monitor the execution of integration strategies, the trajectory of SG&A expenses, and improvements in cash flow metrics. Such monitoring would be crucial to identify if the anticipated synergies and strategic benefits from acquisitions materialize, thereby realigning the investment thesis based on evolving corporate performance and market conditions.
