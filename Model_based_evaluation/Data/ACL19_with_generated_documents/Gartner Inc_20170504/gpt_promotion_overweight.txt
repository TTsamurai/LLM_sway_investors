Based on the recent earnings call, it is clear that the company has delivered another strong quarter of double-digit year-on-year growth and exceptional financial performance across its business segments. The company's Research segment saw a 15% revenue growth, Events revenue increased by 11%, and Consulting revenue was up 2%. The company continues to target another year of mid-teens growth and expects double-digit revenue growth for the full year.

The company has made significant investments to capture its vast market opportunity and remains confident in its ability to generate long-term double-digit growth with strong free cash flow conversion. The recent acquisition of CEB further strengthens the company's ability to address the mission-critical priorities of functional business leaders across all industries and sizes of enterprises worldwide.

The company anticipates between 5% and 7% accretion in adjusted EPS for 2017 and continues to target double-digit accretion for 2018. The company expects to deleverage over the next 24 to 36 months and aims to reduce its gross leverage to around three times.

Overall, the company's strong financial performance and outlook for the future make it an attractive investment opportunity with an 'overweight' stance.
