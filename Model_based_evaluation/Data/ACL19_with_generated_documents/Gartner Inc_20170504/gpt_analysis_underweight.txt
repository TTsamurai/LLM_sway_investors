The recent earnings conference call transcript provides key insights and financial metrics for analyzing the company. Here are some of the key points that form the basis for our 'underweight' investment stance:

- The company reported double-digit year-on-year growth, including total revenue growth of 13% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 1%. However, the growth in Consulting revenue was flat year-on-year, signaling a potential stagnation in this business segment.
- Events revenue growth was only 11% on an FX-neutral basis, which is lower than the growth in other segments and could indicate a potential weakness in this area.
- Consulting backlog decreased by 9% year-on-year, which could indicate a decline in future revenue growth for this segment.
- Operating cash flow was an outflow of $30 million in Q1, compared to a $13 million inflow in the year-ago quarter, suggesting a deterioration in cash flow management.
- The company has taken on a significant amount of debt due to recent acquisitions, leading to approximately $3.6 billion of gross debt as of April 5th, 2017, and a net debt of approximately $3 billion.

Based on these insights, it appears that the company may be facing challenges in maintaining consistent growth and managing its debt load. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance is warranted until the company demonstrates improved financial performance and a reduction in debt levels.
