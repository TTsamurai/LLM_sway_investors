. As a financial analyst, I have prepared a future outlook report for the company based on the recent earnings conference call transcript. The company's performance in the first quarter has been strong, with double-digit year-on-year growth across various segments. The Research segment saw a 15% growth in revenue on an FX-neutral basis, with total contract value reaching $1.95 billion. The Events segment also experienced 11% revenue growth, and the Consulting segment, while flat in revenue growth, showed a 2% increase on an FX-neutral basis.

The company's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $106 million, meeting the Q1 expectation. The company expects to achieve mid-teens growth for the year, with consistent free cash flow conversion. The recent acquisitions of L2 and CEB have contributed to the company's revenue and growth outlook for the rest of the year.

The company's gross debt increased to approximately $3.6 billion as of April 5, with a net debt of $3 billion upon closing. The company's 2017 outlook includes an adjusted revenue range of $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion and an adjusted EBITDA range of $685 million to $735 million.

The company expects a 5% to 7% accretion in adjusted EPS for 2017, with double-digit accretion targeted for 2018. The company's cash flow guidance includes free cash flow of $335 million to $365 million for 2017, with a focus on deleveraging over the next 24 to 36 months.

Based on the company's strong operational performance, consistent growth across segments, and strategic acquisitions, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance for the company. The company's ability to drive productivity and growth, along with its focus on improving sales productivity and its strong free cash flow conversion, support a positive outlook for future performance. Additionally, the company's targeting of double-digit accretion in adjusted EPS for 2018 further strengthens the investment stance.
