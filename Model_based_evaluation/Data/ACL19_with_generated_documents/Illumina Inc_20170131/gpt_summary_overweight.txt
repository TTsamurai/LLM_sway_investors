2. Gross Margin: Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 69.9%, lower sequentially by 260 basis points, primarily due to product transition reserves and increased investments in manufacturing operations.

Based on the financial metrics outlined above, there are positive indicators for the company's performance. An 'overweight' investment stance is recommended, given the company's growth in revenue, strong gross margins, and solid cash flow and liquidity position. These factors, along with the company's guidance for revenue growth in 2017, support a favorable investment outlook. Additionally, the company's strategic investments in new platforms, such as NovaSeq, demonstrate a commitment to future growth and innovation.
