- **HiSeq Family:** Continued adherence to pull-through guidance ($300,000 to $350,000 for HiSeq and $625,000 to $725,000 for HiSeq X).
- **Future Projections:** Decline expected in HiSeq family usage due to adoption of new platforms.

**Financial Metrics:**
- **Gross Margin:** Adjusted non-GAAP gross margin at 69.9%, a decrease of 260 basis points sequentially, impacted by product transition reserves and increased manufacturing costs.
- **Operating Expenses:**
  - R&D expenses stood at $121 million (19.5% of revenue).

- **Full-Year Growth:** Anticipated to be 10% to 12%, influenced partly by less than 1% revenue contributions each from GRAIL and Helix.
- **Earnings Per Share:**
  - Q1 GAAP EPS predicted between $0.51 and $0.56.
