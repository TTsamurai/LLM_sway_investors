1. **Organic Revenue Growth:** The company experienced 4% growth overall. This marks the strongest rate of organic revenue growth seen at the start of any year since 2012, benefiting from contributions across the entire portfolio. Notably, Health Solutions displayed a significant surge with double-digit growth.

2. **Operating Margin:** Operating margin increased by 220 basis points. This improvement was primarily driven by solid organic revenue growth coupled with successful investment returns across Aon's portfolio. Further contributions to margin expansion included expense savings from restructuring activities and various operational initiatives.

3. **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** EPS rose by 20% to $1.45. The increase was prominently due to strong operational performance, aided by a lower effective tax rate and efficient capital management.
