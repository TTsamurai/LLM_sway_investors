. Thank you for providing such detailed and insightful information. It's clear that Aon is focused on continuous growth and innovation to serve its clients and shareholders. The key financial metrics highlighted in the call include organic revenue growth, operating margin, earnings per share, and free cash flow. The first quarter results showed strong performance in these areas, with 4% organic revenue growth, a 220 basis point increase in operating margin, a 20% increase in earnings per share, and a 38% increase in free cash flow.

The company's strategy to focus on the five revenue lines - Commercial Risk Solutions, Reinsurance Solutions, Retirement Solutions, Health Solutions, and Data & Analytic Services - reflects its commitment to aligning the firm around its clients' highest priorities and investing in high-growth, high-margin areas. The focus on technology, colleague experience, and operational improvements also demonstrates a commitment to strengthening the firm's operating model.

The recent Outsourcing platform divestiture is expected to provide approximately $3 billion of capital to accelerate investment in emerging client needs. This, along with the $900 million investment back into the business, is expected to result in a substantially stronger firm with higher top line and bottom line growth, and increased free cash flow.

Overall, Aon's leadership position in each of its revenue lines, strong client retention rates, and strategic investments in high-growth areas indicate a positive outlook for continued long-term growth and value creation for shareholders. The company's focus on delivering global capability locally and driving operational improvements positions it well for future success.
