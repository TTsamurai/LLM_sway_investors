Based on the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that Aon is in a strong position and is poised for future growth and value creation. The company's commitment to strengthening its client-serving capabilities and achieving exceptional results for clients and shareholders is well-demonstrated. Key financial metrics from the first quarter of 2017 include 4% organic revenue growth and a 220 basis point increase in operating margin. There was also a 20% increase in earnings per share and a 38% increase in free cash flow.

The company's strategic initiatives, including the divestiture of its Outsourcing platform, are expected to provide approximately $3 billion in capital to accelerate investment in emerging client needs. This reflects the company's focus on delivering advice and solutions, aligning its portfolio around its clients' highest priorities, and reinforcing its return on invested capital decision-making process.

Additionally, Aon's leadership positions in its five revenue lines - Commercial Risk Solutions, Reinsurance Solutions, Retirement Solutions, Health Solutions, and Data & Analytic Services, highlight its commitment to providing a broad range of risk, retirement, and health solutions using proprietary data and analytics.

The company's emphasis on continuous innovation and reinvestment in high-growth, high-margin areas across its portfolio reflects its dedication to driving long-term growth. Aon's enthusiasm for the next substantial wave of value creation for shareholders, as well as its commitment to accelerating growth and strengthening the firm's financial platform, underlines its confidence in its future outlook.

As a financial analyst, considering the strong performance in the first quarter and the company's strategic initiatives to accelerate growth, it would be recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance on Aon as it is well-positioned for continued success and value creation.
