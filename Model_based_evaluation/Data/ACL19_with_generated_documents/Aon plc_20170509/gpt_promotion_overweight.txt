Based on the recent earnings call, I would recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Aon. The company's first quarter 2017 results reflect a strong start to the year, with organic revenue growth at 4%, the strongest rate of growth since 2012. The company's strategic investments in high growth areas and Data & Analytics are driving new business generation, strong retention rates, and increased operating leverage across the portfolio, positioning the firm for continued long-term growth. The recent Outsourcing platform divestiture provides approximately $3 billion of capital to accelerate investment in emerging client needs, reinforcing the return on invested capital decision making process and emphasis on free cash flow. As Aon strengthens its operating model and aligns its portfolio around clients' highest priorities, the company is expected to substantially strengthen for clients, colleagues, and shareholders, representing the next wave of shareholder value creation. Overall, the company's momentum and strategic initiatives make Aon a compelling investment opportunity for the future.
