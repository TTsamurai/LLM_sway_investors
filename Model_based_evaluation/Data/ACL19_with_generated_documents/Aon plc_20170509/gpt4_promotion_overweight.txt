**Strategic Initiatives:**
Aon's strategic actions underpin their financial success and future prospects:
1. **Optimized Business Model:** The divestiture of the Outsourcing platform both aligns with Aon's core strategic focus on professional services and reinforces their capital allocation strategy, liberating approximately $3 billion for reinvestment.
