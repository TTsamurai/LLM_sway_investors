Dear [Recipient],

In analyzing the recent earnings conference call transcript of the company, Aon, we have derived key insights and financial metrics that support our decision to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance. The company's CFO and CEO emphasized Aon's focus on strengthening the firm and creating value for clients and shareholders by providing a broad range of risk, retirement, and health solutions using proprietary data and analytics.

Despite Aon's positive results in the first quarter of 2017, with organic revenue growth of 4%, operating margin increase of 220 basis points, EPS increase of 20%, and free cash flow increase of 38%, several elements have led us to adopt the 'underweight' stance. These include the divestiture of the Outsourcing platform, which is expected to provide approximately $3 billion of capital to accelerate investment in emerging client needs and to strengthen Aon's ability to make new investments in high-growth, high-margin areas. This strategic move, while providing financial flexibility, also raises concerns about the company's future direction and potential for sustained growth. Additionally, the emphasis on reallocating capital and investing $900 million back into the business to unify and improve the operating model, including technology, real estate, and colleague experience, raises questions about the company's ability to generate significant returns on these investments.

Furthermore, the focus on the five revenue lines, namely Commercial Risk Solutions, Reinsurance Solutions, Retirement Solutions, Health Solutions, and Data & Analytic Services, indicates a shift in Aon's strategic direction. While the company's management highlights the opportunity for substantial growth in these areas, increased investment and realignment of the business raise concerns about potential disruptions and the effective utilization of resources. The emphasis on strengthening the client serving capability and delivering all of Aon's global capabilities locally indicates a shift in the company's operating model, which may take time to yield significant returns.

In summary, despite Aon's positive financial performance and strategic initiatives, the recent developments and reallocation of capital raise concerns about the company's future direction and potential for sustained, substantial growth. Therefore, we recommend adopting an 'underweight' investment stance for Aon.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
