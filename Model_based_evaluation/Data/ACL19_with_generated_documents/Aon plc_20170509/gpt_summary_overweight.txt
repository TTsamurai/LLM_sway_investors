Summary:
The CEO of Aon gives a detailed overview of the company's progress and strategy during a recent earnings conference call. The company has had a strong first quarter in 2017, with organic revenue growth at 4%, the highest rate since 2012. Operating margins have increased, and the EPS has also improved significantly. The company is focusing on strategic investments in high-growth areas and is aligning its portfolio around its clients' highest priorities. The Outsourcing platform divestiture has provided a catalyst for the company to make new investments in high-growth, high-margin areas. The company's CEO and CFO express confidence in the firm's ability to capture the full opportunity for growth and believe they are at the beginning of the next substantial wave of value creation for shareholders. They emphasize the importance of delivering the firm as a whole rather than focusing on cross-selling individual products or services. There is a strong focus on accelerating growth and investing in areas of greatest client need. The company is not undergoing a restructuring or reorganization, but rather a collaborative effort to better serve clients and strengthen the firm. The company remains committed to improving key financial metrics, including operating margin and free cash flow growth.

The financial analyst should adopt an 'overweight' investment stance based on the company's strong financial performance, strategic initiatives, and outlook for accelerating growth and value creation for shareholders. Key financial metrics such as organic revenue growth, operating margin improvement, and EPS growth are all positive indicators for the company's future potential. The company's strong momentum, strategic investments in high-growth areas, and focus on delivering value to clients provide a compelling case for an overweight investment stance.
