in today's call and for your ongoing interest in GM. We're confident in our ability to navigate the current business environment and continue to drive long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you.

Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript and the financial metrics provided, it is clear that GM is facing challenges in the industry, particularly with softer sales in the U.S. and pricing challenges in China. The company is also undergoing significant restructuring in international markets, which includes focusing on higher return opportunities and phasing out certain brands. 

While the company's return on invested capital is strong at 30.4%, it is important to note that the company plans to return up to $7 billion to shareholders by the end of 2017 through dividends and share buybacks, subject to market conditions. This indicates that GM may prioritize returning capital to shareholders over reinvesting in the business.

In terms of regional performance, North America continues to show strength, particularly in the crossover segment, while China has also seen growth in sales, especially for Cadillac and Baojun brands. South America has posted improvements, but it still faces challenging macroeconomic conditions. 

GM's focus on transformative technologies such as electrification, autonomous technology, connectivity, and shared mobility services is a positive long-term strategy. However, the company is also facing pressure to adapt to changing consumer preferences, particularly the shift from smaller cars to crossovers and trucks. The company is confident in its product portfolio and efficient architectures to address these changes, but it remains to be seen how successful these efforts will be.

The company's aggressive approach to autonomous vehicles, particularly its work on Super Cruise and the deployment of autonomous vehicles in commercial ridesharing networks, shows promise. However, the competitive landscape in this space is evolving rapidly, and GM will need to continue to invest in and develop these technologies to maintain its leadership position.

Overall, the challenges in the industry, the company's focus on returning capital to shareholders, and the need to adapt to changing consumer preferences suggest some caution in the company's future outlook. Therefore, adopting an 'underweight' investment stance for GM may be warranted at this time.
