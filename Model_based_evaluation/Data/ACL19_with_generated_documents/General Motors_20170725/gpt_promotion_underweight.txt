 in today's call, and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the future.

Based on the recent earnings call, it is evident that GM has faced challenges in the U.S. and China which have impacted their revenue and income. The company's restructuring actions in Europe and international operations, as well as their focus on core business performance, may limit their ability to capitalize on growth opportunities in the short term. Additionally, the softer industry sales in the U.S. and pricing challenges in China are concerning. 

While the company has made strides in key segments such as crossovers and SUVs and is investing in transformative technologies around electrification, autonomous technology, connectivity, and shared mobility services, it remains to be seen whether these investments will translate into significant shareholder value in the near future.

Furthermore, the company's commitment to improving operational efficiency and achieving a cost reduction target of $6.5 billion by the end of the year is commendable. However, the cautious business environment in the second half of the year may impact their ability to achieve this goal.

In conclusion, given the challenges faced by GM and the uncertain business environment, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company until clearer signs of sustained growth and profitability are demonstrated.
