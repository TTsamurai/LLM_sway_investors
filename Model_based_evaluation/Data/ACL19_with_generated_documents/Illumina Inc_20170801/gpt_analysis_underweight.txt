 as revenue, and in other cases they're buying the arrays from us as a product. We have definitely seen some larger deals where customers are scaling up their deployments. The launch trajectory for VeriSeq NIPT was faster than we expected and the reimbursement in Europe is progressing, which is a positive sign for future growth in that area. We are also seeing strong growth in the oncology testing market, driven by commercial molecular diagnostic and liquid biopsy customers. The FDA approval of the Extended RAS companion diagnostic kit for metastatic colorectal cancer is a significant milestone for us. The recent FDA pan cancer approval of Keytruda also has positive implications for genomics in patient care, and we expect it to drive future demand for our products. The launch of our Helix online marketplace has been successful, and we are seeing strong growth in the direct-to-consumer market. In conclusion, we expect continued strong demand for NovaSeq, with the HiSeq replacement cycle just beginning. We are also seeing positive trends in the consumer genomics market, clinical oncology testing, and the launch of new products such as VeriSeq NIPT. Based on these key insights and financial metrics, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. Despite the strong performance in Q2, there are uncertainties about the future impact of NovaSeq on the HiSeq and HiSeq X shipments, as well as potential competition in the consumer genomics market. Additionally, the timeline for the launch of new products and their impact on revenue and EPS is uncertain. Hence, I advise caution in investing in the company at this time.
