of that kind of strategy. So, I'm not trying to be dismissive of them. I just don't see that. I just don't see a strategic rationale between those companies moving in this space. That's my honest opinion. We have made a change, and we went with some different technology in some of our major markets and – quite past some of our old technology. That transition didn't go as smooth as we thought it would. And so they're still dealing with – and they're now dealing with some of the fallout as they run out the installed base of old technology. So, that's going to continue this year. We see margin expansion really hasn't been throttled that much through this because we see other good things happening. My expectation is that as we get toward the end of 2018, I think all this is behind them. But they've gone through this before, and they always emerge stronger from it. I don't think there's anything about our fundamental view of what's going on in the business. I think it's more an execution story that just didn't go as smoothly as we'd hoped it would. I think they're quite excited about that, actually. They've made – we just recently put a new North American leader in that business. She's got a good track record and so we're optimistic that that business can grow even faster in the second half than the first and that the profitability will expand with it. You would see that improvement if you compare third quarter this year to third quarter last year, but not a major shift from second quarter to third quarter or third quarter to fourth quarter, excluding, obviously, the currency impacts. So, that's the flow of the margin story. So we're not really worried about that. Thanks. I don't think this year – I mean, last year, mining was down double digits. I mean, if it can get better, that's going to be an easy story. So, we see mining picking up toward the end of the year. So, we don't think it's a big deal. Heavy is – the first half showed the least acceleration of the two businesses. But the comps getting easier in the second half, and we have our new technology moving well. And so comps improve and I think both continue to accelerate throughout the year. So, quite optimistic.
