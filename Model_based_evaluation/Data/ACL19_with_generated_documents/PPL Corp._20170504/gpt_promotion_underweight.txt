Based on the recent earnings call transcript from PPL, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. The first quarter earnings results fell short of expectations, with a reduction in earnings primarily driven by lower foreign currency exchange rates and an unusually mild winter in Kentucky. The company has reaffirmed its 2017 forecast of earnings from ongoing operations, but there are concerns about achieving the projected 5% to 6% compound annual EPS growth from 2017 through 2020. While the company has reduced exposure to foreign currency exchange rates through hedging, there are still uncertainties surrounding the Brexit process and its potential impact on the company's UK operations. Additionally, the rate review before the Kentucky Public Service Commission and the proposed agreement in Pennsylvania may pose regulatory risks. It is advised to approach investment in PPL with caution due to these factors.
