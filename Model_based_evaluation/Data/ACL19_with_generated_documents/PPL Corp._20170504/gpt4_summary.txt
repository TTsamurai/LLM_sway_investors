## Summary Report on PPL’s Earnings Conference Call (Q1 2017)

### Key Points Discussed:

#### 1. **Earnings Overview:**
   - **Reported Earnings**: Q1 2017 reported earnings were $0.59 per share, down from $0.71 per share in Q1 2016.
   - **Ongoing Earnings**: Q1 2017 earnings from ongoing operations were $0.62 per share, compared to $0.67 per share in the previous year.
   - **Drivers of Earnings Change**: The decrease was primarily due to lower foreign currency exchange rates and an unusually mild winter in Kentucky. An April 1, 2016 price increase in the UK partially offset these effects.

#### 2. **2017 Earnings Forecast:**
   - **Earnings Guidance**: The company reaffirmed its 2017 forecast for earnings from ongoing operations of $2.05 to $2.25 per share, with a midpoint of $2.15 per share.
   - **Growth Projections**: They expect a compound annual EPS growth of 5% to 6% from 2017 through 2020.

#### 3. **Utility Operations and Updates:**
   - **Kentucky**: A rate review is in progress, with expected total annual revenue increase of $122 million if approved. This includes investment in infrastructure to enhance reliability and natural gas safety.
   - **Pennsylvania**: A new five-year labor agreement was ratified with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1600, effective May 22.
   - **UK Operations**: Following the formal initiation of Brexit on March 29, there are no anticipated changes to UK operations.

#### 4. **Currency Hedging and Brexit Impact:**
   - **Hedging Strategy**: PPL has increased its hedging levels to reduce exposure to foreign currency exchange rates. The additional hedging should secure at least the low end of their 5% to 6% EPS growth target even if the pound falls to $1.05.
   - **Brexit**: The pound has been stable since the official Brexit process began, with current exchange rates around $1.29 per pound.

#### 5. **Capital Spending and Dividend Policy:**
   - **Capital Expenditures**: There’s a proposal to remove or defer just over $300 million in capital expenditures from the 2017 through 2019 plan.
   - **Dividends**: The company targets an annual dividend growth of about 4% from 2017 through 2020, with the dividend increased from $1.52 per share to $1.58 per share in February.

#### 6. **Financial Position and Investor Assurance:**
   - **Credit Metrics**: PPL continues to maintain strong investment-grade credit metrics and one of the highest dividend yields in the sector.
   - **Stakeholder Commitments**: PPL stresses its commitment to delivering reliable service and value for shareholders through continuous infrastructure investments, operational execution, and strategic hedging against currency risks.

### Conclusion:
The initial quarter of 2017 shows a slight decline in earnings due to external economic factors, but PPL remains optimistic about achieving its financial targets through strategic management of resources and effective risk mitigation strategies. The company continues to focus on operational excellence, sustainable growth, and maintaining a robust financial framework to support future developments and shareholder returns.
