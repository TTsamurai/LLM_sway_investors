### Summary Report on PPL’s Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call

#### Investment Stance: Overweight

**1. ** **Earnings Overview:**
   - **Q1 2017 Reported Earnings:** $0.59 per share, a decline from $0.71 per share in Q1 2016.
   - **Earnings from Ongoing Operations (Adjusted):** $0.62 per share, down from $0.67 per share in Q1 2016. The primary reasons for the decrease were unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and a mild winter in Kentucky, although partially offset by a price increase in the UK from April 1, 2016.

**2. ** **Earnings Guidance and Growth Outlook:**
   - **2017 Forecast:** Reaffirmed earnings from ongoing operations of $2.05 to $2.25 per share with a midpoint of $2.15 per share.
   - **Long-term Growth:** Targets a compound annual EPS growth of 5% to 6% from 2017 through 2020, with specific growth rates of 4% to 6% in U.S. utilities and 6% to 8% in the UK utilities.

**3. ** **Dividend and Shareholder Returns:**
   - **Dividend Update:** Annual dividend growth targeted at about 4% per year from 2017 through 2020. Recent increase in February's annualized dividend from $1.52 to $1.58 per share.

**4. ** **Operational Highlights and Strategic Updates:**
   - **UK Market:** Despite Brexit, PPL remains optimistic about delivering its long-term growth, supported by a stable pound to dollar exchange rate and an effective hedging strategy.
   - **Kentucky Operations:** Rate review is proceeding, with settlements potentially leading to a $122 million annual revenue increase. There are also plans to invest in advanced infrastructure to enhance service reliability and safety.
   - **Labor Relations:** A new five-year labor agreement with the IBEW Local 1600, ensuring competitive wages and benefits.
   
**5. ** **Financial Position and Risk Management:**
   - **Currency Hedging:** Further increased hedging levels in Q1; capable of achieving at least the low end of targeted EPS growth even if the pound falls to $1.05.
   - **Capital Expenditures:** More than $300 million deferred from the 2017-2019 capital plan, focusing on cost-effective and strategic investments in utility infrastructure.
   - **Credit Metrics:** Maintaining investment-grade credit ratings while supporting strong dividend yields.

#### Investment Thesis:
Given PPL’s solid earnings guidance, strong dividend growth, strategic risk management, and sound operational strategies, we adopt an overweight investment stance. PPL demonstrates robust potential for sustainable growth through strategic investments, efficient management of operational risks (including Brexit and currency fluctuations), and an unwavering commitment to shareholder returns. The reaffirmation of the earnings forecast and continued investments in infrastructure substantiate a positive outlook, making PPL a compelling option for long-term investors.
