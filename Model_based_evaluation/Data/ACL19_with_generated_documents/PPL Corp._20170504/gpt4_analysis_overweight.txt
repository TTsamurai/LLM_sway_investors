# **Future Outlook Report on PPL Corporation: Overweight Investment Stance**

## Executive Overview:
PPL Corporation, with a significant presence in both the U.S. and the UK utility sectors, presents a compelling investment opportunity marked by strategic financial and operational planning, robust financial performance, and an effective mitigation of risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations. Based on the insights drawn from the company's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call, we recommend an **Overweight** stance on PPL Corporation’s shares.

## Financial Performance Assessment:

### **Earnings Summary:**
- **Q1 2017 Reported Earnings:** $0.59 per share, down from Q1 2016’s $0.71 due to adverse foreign currency exchange rates and mild winter effects in Kentucky.
- **Earnings from Ongoing Operations:** Adjusted for peculiar items, stood at $0.62 per share in Q1 2017 compared to $0.67 the previous year.
- **Forecast for 2017:** Earnings expected to be between $2.05 to $2.25 per share, with a stable outlook supporting this forecast despite present challenges.

### **Strategic Financial Maneuvers:**
- **Foreign Currency Hedging:** Enhanced hedging strategies have substantially reduced exposure to unfavourable currency movements, with promising hedging positions established even if the GBP falls much below current levels (highlighted stability around $1.29/GBP).
- **Dividend Policy:** The company has increased its annualized dividend in February 2017, marking a continued target of about 4% annual growth.
- **Capital Expenditure Adjustments:** Notable adjustments, such as the deferment of $300 million capital expenditures in advanced meters to optimize and realign investment strategies.

## Operational Review:
- **Regulatory Progress:** Favorable outcomes in Kentucky rate reviews are likely pending, which could enable further enhancement of infrastructure and reliability.
- **UK Operations Amid Brexit:** Stability and projected positive adaptation to the UK’s EU exit process outline a minimized business impact horizon. The operational directives remain unchanged fostering confidence in UK market stability.
- **U.S. Labor Relations:** A new five-year labor agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1600 supports operational steadiness and employee relations.

## Long-term Growth Potential:
- **Forecasted Growth:** Annual compounded EPS growth is estimated at 5% to 6% through to 2020, driven by consistent operational performance and calculated financial strategies. Specifically, growth projections are separated by region with the U.S. utilities expecting 4%-6% and UK operations forecasting 6%-8% growth.
- **Infrastructure Investments:** Continued emphasis on enhancing utility reliability and customer service through intelligent investments in infrastructure, which aligns well with long-term growth objectives.

## Recommendation Justification:
Our **Overweight** stance is fundamentally anchored on PPL’s prudent financial management, evidenced by its robust hedging strategy and consistent dividend growth amidst operational efficiencies and strategic capital deployment. The reaffirmed earnings forecast, despite potential forex and operational risks, further reassures the investment community of PPL's ability to navigate through fiscal complexities while sustaining growth.

By adopting a proactive approach to both expected and unexpected economic variables, PPL Corporation not only promises resilience but also growth, making it an attractive investment proposition in the utilities sector.
