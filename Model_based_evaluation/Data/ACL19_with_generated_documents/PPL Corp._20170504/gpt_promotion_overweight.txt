Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an "overweight" investment stance in the company. The first quarter 2017 reported earnings were slightly lower compared to the previous year's results due to lower foreign currency exchange rates and an unusually mild winter in Kentucky. However, the company reaffirmed its 2017 forecast of earnings from ongoing operations and expressed confidence in its ability to deliver overall compound annual EPS growth of 5% to 6% from 2017 through 2020.

The company's ongoing hedging program has reduced its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates, and it is well-positioned to deliver long-term growth even if exchange rates were to fall. Additionally, the company targets annual dividend growth of about 4% a year from 2017 through 2020.

In terms of utility operations, the company has reached settlement agreements in Kentucky and Pennsylvania, which will result in revenue increases and improvements in reliability and safety. The impact of the UK's exit from the European Union on the company's operations is expected to be minimal.

The company also remains focused on growing its U.S. businesses through the deployment of capital and is confident in its ability to meet its EPS growth targets, despite potential delays in capital programs.

Overall, the company's strong start in the first quarter and its clear strategy for growth make it a compelling investment opportunity. With its ability to deliver on its commitments to customers and shareholders, an "overweight" investment stance is recommended.
