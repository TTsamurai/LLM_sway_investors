Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, I would adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for PPL Corporation. Here are the key insights and financial metrics that support this stance:

1. Earnings Decline: The company reported a decline in earnings, with first quarter 2017 earnings of $0.59 per share compared to $0.71 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted ongoing earnings also decreased from $0.67 per share to $0.62 per share. This indicates a downward trend in earnings, which is a concern for investors.

2. Impact of Weather: The company cited an unusually mild winter in Kentucky as a factor that negatively impacted earnings. This shows that the company's earnings are susceptible to weather conditions, which can be unpredictable and impact future performance.

3. 2017 Earnings Forecast: The company reaffirmed its 2017 forecast of earnings from ongoing operations of $2.05 to $2.25 per share, with a midpoint of $2.15 per share. While the forecast is maintained, the previous decline in earnings and reliance on weather conditions may pose a risk to meeting this forecast.

4. Growth Targets: PPL Corporation expects a compound annual EPS growth of 5% to 6% from 2017 through 2020. However, there is uncertainty regarding achieving this growth, especially with external factors such as foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of the UK's exit from the European Union (Brexit).

5. Operational Challenges: The company faces challenges in its utility operations, such as rate review processes and regulatory approvals. These challenges may impact the company's ability to execute its infrastructure plans and maintain its financial position.

Based on these insights and financial metrics, the 'underweight' investment stance is advisable as there are concerns about the company's earnings, growth prospects, and operational challenges. Investors should proceed with caution and carefully monitor the company's performance in the coming quarters before making investment decisions.
