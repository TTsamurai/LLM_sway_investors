The company has experienced solid second quarter results, with revenues up 4% to $37.1 billion and adjusted diluted EPS growing 5% compared to the previous fiscal year. The company attributes these results to strong performance across its specialty businesses, good generics volumes growth, and strategic and disciplined management of operating expenses. As a result of this solid performance, the company is updating its fiscal year 2017 financial guidance, including tightening its adjusted diluted EPS range.

The U.S. pharmaceutical market remains well-positioned for long-term growth, driven by an aging patient population, an improving U.S. economy, a robust pipeline of anticipated brand drug launches, and an increasing focus on the relationship between value and outcomes. AmerisourceBergen sees both resilience and continuing growth opportunities in pharmaceuticals and a vital role for manufacturer and provider services to support the market expansion over time.

AmerisourceBergen's new purpose statement, "to create healthier futures," ties everything the company does to fulfilling this purpose. The company focuses on providing services and solutions that improve product access, increase efficiency across the healthcare system, and enhance patient care.

The company believes it has four key differentiators that set AmerisourceBergen apart and have positioned it for growth: its strong customer base, leadership position in specialty, innovative approach to services and solutions, and proven ability to integrate acquired businesses.

The company has continued to execute in the second quarter, despite market challenges, and remains committed to enabling the growth of its customers, serving patients, and delivering value to its shareholders. The company has a clear and defined purpose and is united in its responsibility to create healthier futures, reinforcing its commitment to its customers, patients, and shareholders.

Overall, the company's solid performance in the second quarter, its focus on long-term growth opportunities, and its commitment to financial stewardship and value creation for shareholders make it a compelling investment opportunity. Therefore, the recommendation is to take an 'overweight' investment stance based on the company's recent earnings call.
