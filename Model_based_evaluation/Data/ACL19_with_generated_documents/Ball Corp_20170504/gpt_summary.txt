In the first quarter of 2017, Ball reported a 29% improvement in comparable diluted earnings per share compared to the previous year. This improvement was attributed to the benefit of the beverage can acquisition, solid operational performance in all businesses, increased global demand for beverage and aerosol containers, and a lower tax rate. However, these benefits were partially offset by higher compensation and project costs, higher interest expense, and a higher share count.

The Beverage Packaging North & Central America segment saw improved volumes due to the contribution of recently acquired plants in the U.S. and Mexico, plant efficiencies, and continued growth in specialty cans. Industry demand in the U.S. and Canada dipped slightly in the first quarter, likely due to timing factors, while volumes in Mexico continued to grow in the beer sector.

The South American segment saw improving volumes and the company feels more constructive about the market and economy for the full year, particularly in Brazil where the economic situation appears to be improving.

The Beverage Packaging Europe segment performed in line with expectations, with initiatives to improve revenue and cost management underway. Additionally, the construction of a new plant in Spain is progressing as planned.

The Asia-Pacific business, acquired EMEA business, and corporate undistributed cost were all managed effectively, with cost savings and operational performance contributing to positive financial performance.

In the food and aerosol segment, comparable segment earnings were up year-over-year due to continued growth in global aerosol, offset by a decline in U.S. food can demand. Cost savings associated with the closure of a metal service center in West Virginia and anticipated growth in aluminum aerosol products are expected to benefit the segment in the second quarter.

Looking ahead, Ball expects full year 2017 comparable operating earnings in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, excluding the amortization associated with acquired customer intangibles. Free cash flow for 2017 is expected to be in the range of $750 million to $850 million, with interest expense in the range of $280 million, an effective tax rate of 26%, and corporate undistributed costs of about $140 million.

It was also mentioned that the company plans to de-lever and become an aggressive acquirer of its shares once the target debt level is reached. The company is also focused on increasing EVA dollars from the combined business and is working on various cost-saving and capital management initiatives to support long-term growth.
