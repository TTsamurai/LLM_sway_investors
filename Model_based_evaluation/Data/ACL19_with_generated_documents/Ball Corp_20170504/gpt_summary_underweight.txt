As a financial analyst, after reviewing the earnings conference call transcript, I recommend adopting an 'underweight' investment stance on Ball Corporation. Despite the company's first quarter results showing improved diluted earnings per share, there are several key financial metrics that signal potential risks for investors.

First, industry demand in the U.S. and Canada dipped slightly in the first quarter, and there was no leap year, impacting volumes. While volumes in Mexico continued to grow, the company faces challenges in the North and Central America segment.

The Beverage Packaging Europe segment has work to do on its margins and certain initiatives to support multi-year plans have been initiated to improve revenue and cost management. Cost savings benefits in the region, including better operational performance, are expected to bolster second half performance.

Additionally, U.S. food can demand declined by 6% in the first quarter, impacting the food and aerosol segment. The segment is projected to benefit from cost savings associated with the closure of the West Virginia metal service center and anticipated growth for aluminum aerosol products.

Furthermore, corporate undistributed costs in the quarter were higher than the fourth quarter run rate, largely due to the relocation of certain pension costs, higher stock-based compensation, and incremental project costs. This increase in corporate costs may impact the company's overall financial performance.

The company plans to de-lever to reduce net debt, but it is important to note that the debt will begin to come down in the back half of the year. The full year 2017 interest expense is projected to be in the range of $280 million, and the full year effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 26%, both of which may impact the company's profitability.

Given these financial metrics and potential risks, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended for Ball Corporation. It is important for investors to carefully monitor the company's performance and financial metrics in the coming quarters.
