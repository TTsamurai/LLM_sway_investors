Based on the recent earnings call, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Ball Corporation. The company's first quarter results showed a 29% improvement in comparable diluted earnings per share, driven by the benefit of last year's beverage can acquisition, solid operational performance, and increased global demand for both beverage and aerosol containers. The Beverage Packaging North & Central America segment also showed strong performance with a 5% increase in volumes, driven by demand for craft beer, super premium beer, and imported Mexican beer brands.

Additionally, the company's Beverage Packaging South America segment saw an improvement in volumes and the economy in Brazil appears to be starting to improve. The Beverage Packaging Europe segment, while reflecting typical seasonality, showed performance in line with expectations and has implemented initiatives to improve revenue and cost management.

Furthermore, Ball's food and aerosol segment showed continued growth in global aerosol, offsetting a decline in U.S. food can demand. The company expects full year 2017 comparable operating earnings in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, with free cash flow expected to be in the range of $750 million to $850 million.

Overall, Ball Corporation's global packaging businesses posted strong results, and the company is poised for continued growth and profitability. With a positive outlook for the future and a solid financial performance, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended for potential investors.
