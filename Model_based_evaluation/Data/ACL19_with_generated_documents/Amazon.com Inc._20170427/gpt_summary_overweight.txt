Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript with Amazon's CFO, Brian Olsavsky, and the financial results for Q1 2017, the following key financial metrics indicate a favorable position for investors:

1. Revenue Growth: Amazon's activity with AWS customers and the purchase of Reserved Instances and prepaid credits contributed to an increase in deferred revenue balances. This indicates a growing customer base and a consistent growth in Prime member purchases.

2. Operating Income: The stock-based compensation expenses have been consolidated into the operating income by segment, providing clearer insights into the overall expenses and the trend analysis. This consolidation allows for better visibility into the impact of stock-based compensation on the company's profitability.

3. Free Cash Flow: The implementation of a new accounting rule in Q1 2017 has resulted in an increase in free cash flow measures for prior periods. This indicates a positive impact on Amazon's financial health and potential for future cash generation.

In conclusion, based on the discussed financial metrics and the company's forward-looking statements, it is recommended that investors maintain an 'overweight' investment stance on Amazon. The company's growth in revenues, improvements in operating income transparency, and positive impact on free cash flow support a favorable outlook for the company's future performance and potential returns for investors.
