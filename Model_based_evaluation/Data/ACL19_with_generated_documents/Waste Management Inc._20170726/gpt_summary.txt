. Thank you for the detailed summary. It looks like the company's financial performance in the second quarter has been strong, with an increase in cash flow from operations and free cash flow. This increase in cash flow is attributed to operating EBITDA growth and improved working capital metrics. The company is also focused on increasing its capital expenditures and funding acquisitions.

The company has generated over $900 million of free cash flow in the first half of the year, putting them on track to meet their 2017 free cash flow guidance of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. This growth in free cash flow allows the company to return value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and to fund acquisitions.

The company has also successfully managed its SG&A costs, with SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue improving by 30 basis points in the second quarter. The company expects SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue to approach 10%, representing a 40 basis point improvement compared to the full year of 2016.

The company's debt-to-EBITDA ratio remained at 2.4 at the end of the second quarter, indicating a strong balance sheet and positioning the company for strategic acquisitions at the right price. The company's effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 was approximately 36.6%, in line with their expected full year 2017 adjusted tax rate of about 36.5%.

Overall, the company has demonstrated strong financial performance in the first half of 2017, with a focus on executing core operating objectives, generating price, growing profitable volumes, and continuous cost improvement. The company remains committed to a capital allocation plan that prioritizes using 100% of free cash flow to pay dividends, execute strategic acquisitions, and buy back stock. The company's record high free cash flow in the first half of the year and its positive outlook for the remainder of 2017 supports the continued execution of its capital allocation plan.
