Based on the recent earnings call, it is clear that the company has shown strong operating results in the second quarter, with significant increases in cash flow from operations and free cash flow. The company's cash flow from operations increased by almost 7%, driven by operating EBITDA growth and improved working capital metrics. This increase in cash flow converted straight through to free cash flow growth, with the company generating over $900 million of free cash flow in the first half of the year.

The company's focus on reducing expenses and improving process efficiency is evident in their disciplined management of SG&A costs, which resulted in a 30 basis point improvement in SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue. Additionally, the company's debt-to-EBITDA ratio remained at a strong 2.4, indicating a healthy balance sheet and positioning them for strategic acquisitions.

The company's effective tax rate for the second quarter was in line with the expected full year adjusted tax rate, and the management remains committed to using 100% of their free cash flow to pay dividends, execute strategic acquisitions, and buy back stock.

The company's positive outlook for the remainder of 2017, along with their record high free cash flow in the first half of the year, supports the continued execution of their capital allocation plan. Additionally, the company plans to repurchase an additional $500 million of their stock in the third quarter, representing their remaining current year authorization for share buyback.

Overall, the company's strong operational performance, focus on cost management and strategic capital allocation plan make them a compelling investment opportunity, and I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company's consistent growth in cash flow and free cash flow, combined with their prudent cost management and strong balance sheet, positions them well for further growth and value creation for shareholders.
