Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is clear that the company has achieved strong underlying performance in the fourth quarter and full year in terms of revenue and EPS growth. The company has also demonstrated the ability to overcome significant headwinds, including the impact of the U.S. dispensing change and the divestiture of the Respiratory Solutions business. The company has achieved significant margin expansion, with gross profit margin improving by 100 basis points and operating margin improving by 180 basis points in the fourth quarter. Additionally, the company has delivered strong currency-neutral EPS growth of 13.2% and is expecting another year of very strong earnings in fiscal year 2018.

The outlook for fiscal year 2018 includes revenue growth of 4% to 5% on a currency-neutral basis and EPS growth of 15% to 16% on an underlying basis, driven by additional cost synergies and continuous improvement initiatives. However, it is important to note that the guidance does not contemplate any potential impact related to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, which could have a significant impact on revenues and EPS growth.

Given the strong performance and outlook for the company, it would be prudent to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance based on the following factors:

1. Potential impact from Hurricane Maria: The company's guidance does not include any potential impact from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, which could have a significant impact on revenues and EPS growth. This uncertainty and potential risk could warrant a cautious investment stance.

2. Tough comparisons and headwinds: The company has indicated that the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 will have a tough comparison to the prior year, as well as the ongoing impact of the U.S. dispensing change. This could lead to lower than average growth in the first half of the year, which may impact investor sentiment.

3. Increased effective tax rate: The company expects an increase in its effective tax rate in fiscal year 2018, which could offset some of the expected earnings growth. This could affect the company's ability to meet its earnings targets and could be a concern for investors.

Overall, while the company has demonstrated strong performance and growth prospects, the potential impact of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, tough comparisons, and headwinds, as well as the expected increase in the effective tax rate, justify an 'underweight' investment stance for the company.
