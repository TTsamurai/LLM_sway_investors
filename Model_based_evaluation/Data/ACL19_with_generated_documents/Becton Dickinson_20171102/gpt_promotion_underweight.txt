Given the recent earnings call and statements made by the company, it is clear that there have been several headwinds that impacted the company's performance, including the U.S. dispensing change, dilution from the Respiratory divestiture, and pension and raw materials cost pressures.

While the company did achieve strong underlying revenue and EPS growth, it is important to note that these results were achieved while overcoming significant headwinds. The impact of these headwinds was approximately 700 basis points in the fourth quarter and 400 basis points for the full year, which is not an insignificant amount.

Furthermore, the company's outlook for fiscal year 2018 also includes notable headwinds from the U.S. dispensing change and an expected increase in the effective tax rate, which will impact earnings growth.

The company also highlighted potential disruptions related to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, which could have a significant impact on revenues and EPS growth for fiscal year 2018.

Taking into consideration these factors, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company, as there are several uncertainties and challenges that could impact its financial performance in the coming year. It is advisable to proceed with caution and monitor the company's ability to overcome these challenges before considering a significant investment.
