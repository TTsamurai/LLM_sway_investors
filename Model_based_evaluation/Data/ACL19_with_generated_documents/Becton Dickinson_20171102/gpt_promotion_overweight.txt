We are extremely excited about the recent earnings call and the strong performance of our company in the fourth quarter and throughout the full fiscal year. Our total fourth quarter revenues of $3.2 billion grew 4.4% on a comparable currency-neutral basis, in line with our previously communicated expectations. Additionally, our adjusted EPS growth of 13.2% reflects our ability to overcome significant headwinds, including the U.S. dispensing change and the dilution from the Respiratory divestiture. We are also proud to have delivered currency neutral EPS growth of approximately 13.2%, reflecting the strength of our performance and the tax benefit from stock comp accounting and other discrete items. This growth demonstrates our ability to overcome notable headwinds and deliver strong earnings. Additionally, we significantly expanded our margins and captured an additional $80 million in annualized synergy cost savings related to the CareFusion acquisition and reached $250 million in annualized cost savings on a cumulative basis through the end of fiscal 2017. We are on track to achieve approximately $350 million in total annualized cost synergies by the end of fiscal 2018, which is the high end of our previously communicated range.

Based on this strong performance, we are recommending an 'overweight' investment stance on our company. We anticipate another year of very strong earnings with 15% to 16% growth on an underlying basis in fiscal year 2018. This includes additional CareFusion cost synergies and aggressive continuous improvement initiatives which will help offset notable headwinds from the U.S. dispensing change and the expected increase in our effective tax rate, resulting in currency neutral earnings growth of approximately 10%. Assuming current spot rates, we expect currency will provide a tailwind in fiscal 2018, resulting in expected EPS growth of approximately 12%.

Furthermore, we expect our underlying operating margin to improve 100 basis points to 150 basis points, bringing our cumulative margin improvement over four years to 600 basis points to 650 basis points. Our cash flow is expected to remain strong with operating cash flow of about $2.9 billion in fiscal year 2018, and we anticipate continued revenue growth driven by recent product launches across both segments and continued strength in both developed and emerging markets.

In summary, we believe that our company's strong performance and ongoing strategic initiatives make it a compelling investment opportunity, and we are confident in our ability to continue delivering long-term value to our shareholders.
