Based on the insights and financial metrics derived from the company's recent earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for ADP. The company reported a decline of 5% in new business bookings in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, which reflects the challenges related to the tailwinds from the previous fiscal year's sales of additional modules related to the Affordable Care Act. The political uncertainty leading up to and following the U.S. elections has also slowed decision-making among clients and prospects.

Additionally, the company has revised its outlook and now expects new business bookings growth to be about flat for fiscal 2017 compared to the previous year. The uncertainty surrounding the future of the Affordable Care Act and other regulations is impacting the company's new business bookings.

While the company is making investments in innovation, service, and sales, and has completed strategic acquisitions to expand its core talent portfolio, the overall business environment seems to be challenging due to the current uncertainty and related hesitancy. The company's sales productivity is also impacted, and the environment for new business bookings growth remains uncertain.

Overall, the current challenges and uncertainties facing the company suggest a cautious approach to investment, indicating an 'underweight' stance on ADP. It is recommended to closely monitor the company's performance and outlook before considering any significant investment.
