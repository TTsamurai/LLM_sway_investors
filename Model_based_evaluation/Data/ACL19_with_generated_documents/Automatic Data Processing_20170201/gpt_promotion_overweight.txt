In summary, ADP reported strong earnings growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, with revenue up 6% to $3 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share growing 20% to $0.87 per share. However, the company experienced a decline of 5% in new business bookings compared to the previous year. This decline was attributed to a difficult grow-over related to the tailwinds from ACA sales in fiscal 2016 and political uncertainty leading up to and following the U.S. elections.

Despite the recent uncertainty, ADP remains optimistic about its future growth, particularly in light of its recent acquisition of The Marcus Buckingham Company (TMBC) to expand its core talent portfolio. This acquisition will bring together ADP's robust data set with TMBC's innovative talent solutions, giving clients the tools, insights, and data needed to improve employee and team performance. Additionally, ADP is focusing on investments in innovation, service, and sales to address continuously evolving needs and opportunities in the HCM industry.

The company continues to receive recognition for its solutions, such as the ADP DataCloud and ADP Mobile Solutions app, which has surpassed 10 million users. Furthermore, ADP is committed to its Service Alignment Initiative, with new strategic service centers opening in Virginia and Arizona. Despite the challenges in new business bookings, ADP maintains a strong position for sustained growth and success.

In conclusion, while the current environment presents challenges, ADP is well-positioned to navigate through the uncertainty and continue to make strategic investments to drive future growth. Based on the company's strong earnings performance and its strategic initiatives, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on ADP.
