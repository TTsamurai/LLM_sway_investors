. Here is a summary of the key financial metrics from the recent earnings conference call transcripts for ADP:

1. Revenue: ADP reported second quarter fiscal 2017 revenue up 6% to $3 billion or 7% on a constant dollar basis. This revenue growth was driven by strong prior period new business bookings and a strengthening in retention metrics.

2. Earnings per Share: Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 20% to $0.87 per share, exceeding expectations for this quarter.

3. New Business Bookings: There was a decline of 5% in new business bookings compared to the previous year, primarily due to a difficult grow-over related to the tailwinds from the fiscal 2016 sales of additional modules related to the Affordable Care Act and political uncertainty leading up to and following the November U.S. elections.

4. Client Experience and Retention: Retention rates for clients on strategic platforms increased by about 10 basis points, driven by ongoing efforts to improve client service metrics. However, there is caution as the company enters a time of the year when clients in the industry are most likely to change providers.

5. Strategic Acquisitions: ADP completed the acquisition of The Marcus Buckingham Company to expand its core talent portfolio, bringing together ADP's robust dataset with TMBC's innovative talent solutions.

6. Service Alignment Initiative: ADP has made progress with the opening of new service and implementation facilities in Norfolk, Virginia, and Orlando. The company also announced the opening of a new strategic service center in Tempe, Arizona, to enhance its service capabilities across the HCM spectrum.

7. Sales Force Productivity: The company's average productivity per sales rep is down, largely driven by the impact of ACA sales. The sales force is being reset for a different environment and the company is focusing on fundamentals and sales force productivity.

Overall, ADP is optimistic about its future growth and success despite the recent uncertainty in the U.S. business environment. The company is positioned to help clients navigate the complexities of HCM and is well-prepared to capitalize on opportunities for growth and expansion in the HCM industry.
