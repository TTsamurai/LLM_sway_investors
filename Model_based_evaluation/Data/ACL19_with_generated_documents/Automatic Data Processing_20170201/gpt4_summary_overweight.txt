**ADP Earnings Conference Call Summary – Fiscal Second Quarter 2017**

**Revenue and Earnings Growth:**
ADP reported a substantial increase in revenue, up 6% to $3 billion, and a commendable 7% increase on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by robust performance in prior periods and increased retention rates, reflecting organic revenue growth across all market segments. Notably, adjusted diluted earnings per share rose by an impressive 20% to $0.87 per share, signaling effective operational management and robust financial health.

**Bookings and Market Dynamics:**
While ADP experienced a 5% decline in new business bookings compared to the strong performance in the same quarter the previous fiscal year, this was anticipated due to the overperformance in fiscal 2016 linked to sales driven by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) modules. The political environment, notably the uncertainty around U.S. elections and the ACA's future, had a palpable impact on client decision-making processes, particularly in the midmarket and upmarket segments. Despite these challenges, ADP remains optimistic about the growth in new business bookings in the second half of fiscal 2017, expected to be flat compared to fiscal 2016.

**Strategic Acquisitions and Investments:**
The acquisition of The Marcus Buckingham Company (TMBC) is a strategic move to enhance ADP's core competency in talent management. TMBC's cutting-edge performance and talent management solutions, coupled with ADP’s extensive data sets, are anticipated to fortify ADP’s position in providing innovative solutions that improve client engagement and worker performance.

**Innovative Successes and Service Enhancements:**
ADP’s innovation pipeline remains strong, demonstrated by the success of ADP DataCloud and ADP Mobile Solutions app. The DataCloud platform now serves several thousand clients, providing critical and actionable workforce analytics. The Mobile Solutions app now boasts over 10 million users, reflecting high usability and relevance in the modern workforce.

**Future Growth and Strategic Initiatives:**
ADP anticipates continued growth through strategic investments in service improvements, innovation, and sales enhancements. The opening of new strategic service centers across various locations is a testament to ADP’s commitment to enhancing service capabilities and addressing evolving market needs effectively.

**Outlook and Guidance:**
Despite a challenging quarter due to slumps in new business bookings largely attributable to political and policy uncertainties in the U.S., ADP’s underlying strong fundamentals and strategic responses position it well for recovery in the latter half of fiscal 2017. Continued focus on client service innovations, strategic acquisitions, and leveraging big data analytics are seen as pivotal strategies in sustaining growth and navigating the complexities of the HCM industry.

**Investment Stance – Overweight:**
Given ADP’s robust earnings performance, strategic initiatives in innovation and acquisitions, and expected recovery of new business bookings, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended. This stance is supported by long-term growth prospects and ADP’s ability to adapt to regulatory and market changes effectively. Potential investors should consider ADP’s track record of resilience and strategic planning, positioning it favorably for sustained future growth.

**Conclusion:**
ADP demonstrates a resilient and pro-active approach in a fluctuating market, signaling strong future performance potential. Investors are advised to closely monitor ADP’s execution of strategic initiatives and any developments in the political landscape that might impact regulatory and business dynamics.
