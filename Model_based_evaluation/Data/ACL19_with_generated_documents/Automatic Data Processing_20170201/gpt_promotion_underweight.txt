Based on the recent earnings call from ADP, there are several factors that suggest a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company. Despite reporting strong earnings growth in the second quarter, there are reasons to recommend an 'underweight' investment stance. The decline in new business bookings, specifically in the midmarket and upmarket segments, can be attributed to political uncertainty surrounding the Affordable Care Act and delays in decision-making among clients and prospects. Additionally, the acquisition of The Marcus Buckingham Company (TMBC) may not have an immediate impact on revenue growth. The company's cautious outlook for new business bookings and revised expectations for fiscal 2017 also indicate potential challenges ahead.

Furthermore, the impact of regulatory changes, such as the potential repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act, has created uncertainty for ADP's clients, leading to hesitancy in making decisions. The company's dependence on the economic environment and its historical data showing a correlation between new business bookings and the strength of the economy raises concerns about future growth in a changing regulatory landscape.

The company's retention rates and initiatives in service and innovation are positive aspects, but they may not be sufficient to offset the challenges in new business bookings. The potential margin pressure in the PEO segment due to lower benefits inflation and the lapping of ACA-related revenues could also affect the company's financial performance.

Overall, while there are positive initiatives and investments in the company's strategy, the current uncertainty and hesitancy among clients indicate a need for caution in considering an investment in ADP. It may be prudent to take an 'underweight' stance on the company's stock based on the factors discussed in the recent earnings call.
