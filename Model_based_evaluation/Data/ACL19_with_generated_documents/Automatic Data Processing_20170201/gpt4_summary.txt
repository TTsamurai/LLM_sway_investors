**ADP Earnings Conference Call Summary Report - Q2 Fiscal 2017**

**Overview:**
ADP reported strong second quarter fiscal year 2017 results, with reported revenue rising to $3 billion, which represents a 6% increase year-over-year, or 7% on a constant currency basis. The company saw significant organic revenue growth across all market segments, attributed to strong prior period new business bookings and improving retention metrics.

**Key Financial Metrics:**
1. **Revenue:** Total reported revenue was $3 billion, up by 6% compared to the same period last year. The increase reflects continued strong performance and client retention.
  
2. **Earnings Per Share:** Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew by 20%, amounting to $0.87 per share. This growth rate exceeded company expectations.
  
3. **New Business Bookings:** ADP experienced a 5% decline in new business bookings compared to the robust second quarter of fiscal 2016. The decline is primarily due to the challenging comparison with the prior year, which saw heightened sales activity related to the modules offered for the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

**Operational Highlights:**
- **Client Retention:** Retention improved, increasing by approximately 10 basis points, benefiting from the company's investments in service enhancement and strategic platforms.
  
- **Acquisitions:** ADP completed the acquisition of The Marcus Buckingham Company (TMBC), aiming to strengthen its core talent portfolio. This acquisition is expected to enhance ADP's existing data capabilities with innovative performance and talent management solutions.
  
- **Product Development:** Highlights during the quarter included further enhancements to ADP DataCloud and ADP Mobile Solutions. The ADP DataCloud now offers expanded geographic and labor market benchmarks.

- **Service Alignment Initiative:** Progress continued on ADP's Service Alignment Initiative with new service centers opened and planned, contributing to enhanced service capabilities across the HCM spectrum.

- **Industry Recognitions:** ADP received several industry accolades during the quarter, including the Everest Groupâ€™s top honor for GlobalView HCM solutions and the Cloud Computing Innovation Award from Ventana Research.

**Challenges & Outlook:**
- **Political and Economic Uncertainty:** The quarter was impacted by political uncertainties, particularly in the U.S., which influenced the decision-making processes of clients and prospects.

- **ACA and Regulatory Changes:** Ongoing discussions about potential changes to the ACA and other regulatory frameworks create uncertainty, affecting new business bookings. Despite this, ADP remains optimistic about leveraging opportunities that arise from legislative changes.

- **FY 2017 Outlook Adjusted:** Given the unexpected decline in new business bookings in Q2, ADP has adjusted its outlook for fiscal year 2017, expecting new business bookings growth to be roughly flat compared to $1.75 billion achieved in fiscal 2016.

**Conclusion:**
Despite facing some headwinds from political and regulatory uncertainties, ADP delivered a strong financial performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The company continues to advance strategically, marked by robust earnings growth, solid client retention, and significant progress in product innovation and strategic acquisitions. Looking forward, ADP remains well-positioned to navigate through ongoing uncertainties, expecting a rebound in new business bookings and sustained growth across its operational domains.
