 in the discussion. Based on the recent earnings call and the company's strategic moves, it is evident that Schlumberger is well-positioned for future growth in the oil market. Despite the current negative sentiments, the company remains positive about the market outlook. With a focus on sustainability and technology, Schlumberger is actively pursuing opportunities in North America, the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. The OneStim joint venture and the acquisition of a majority stake in EDC in Russia further enhance the company's capabilities and market position. Overall, the company's global focus and emphasis on technological innovation make it a compelling investment opportunity, and we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Schlumberger.
