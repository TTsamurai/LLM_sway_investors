 in the Q&A session. 

Based on the information provided in the transcripts, there are several key insights to consider for the outlook of the company and the oil market. 

First, the sustained growth in oil demand provides a strong foundation for the future outlook, with little reason for concern over the demand side of the oil market equation. However, the supply side is more complex, with market nervousness and investor speculation overshadowing facts and physical fundamentals, leading to unpredictable movement in oil prices. 

The three main blocks of global oil supply (Russia and OPEC Gulf countries, U.S. lands, and the rest of the world) each have their own challenges and opportunities. Russia and OPEC Gulf countries are committed to sound stewardship of their resource base, U.S. land E&P companies are driven by short-term production growth, and the rest of the world is focused on meeting cash return expectations of shareholders while facing underinvestment challenges. 

The ongoing underinvestment in the rest of the world indicates a mounting supply challenge over the coming years, and a significant increase in global E&P spend will be required to mitigate this challenge. The company recognizes the importance of serving customers and driving business forward by broadening its technology portfolio and increasing its addressable market. 

In terms of future outlook for oil prices and E&P investments, factors such as moderating investment appetite in the U.S. land, production cuts by key OPEC and non-OPEC countries, and the emerging trend of increasing investments in the rest of the world will affect the market evolution. 

Overall, the company remains positive on the oil markets and is uniquely positioned to capture growth in all markets as global investments start to recover. The OneStim joint venture with Weatherford and the agreement to acquire a majority stake in EDC in Russia demonstrate the companyâ€™s focus on building out its offering in terms of technology and geography. 

Based on these insights, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company, given the uncertainties and challenges in the oil market supply and demand dynamics. The ongoing underinvestment and the potential for mounting supply challenges in the future may impact the company's performance and growth prospects, warranting a cautious investment approach.
