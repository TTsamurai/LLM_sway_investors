in the Q&A. We believe that the information provided in this transcript supports a bullish stance on the oil market, with an emphasis on the potential for increased E&P investments in the coming years. With a focus on key financial indicators such as free cash flow and profitability, we see potential for strong growth in both North America and international markets, particularly in Russia and Asia. This aligns with our 'overweight' investment stance. We have identified potential opportunities for growth, including the OneStim joint venture in North America and the acquisition of a majority stake in EDC in Russia, which will further strengthen our position in the conventional land drilling market. This aligns with our overall investment strategy and outlook for the oil market. Thank you for the opportunity to analyze this earnings conference call transcript.
