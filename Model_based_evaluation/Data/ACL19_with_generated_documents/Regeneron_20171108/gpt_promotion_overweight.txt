. I might add to that, that when you look at the potential of EYLEA in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy, it's clear that there is a significant unmet medical need in the space, particularly for patients with proliferative eye disease. The positive data from the CLARITY study, as published in The Lancet, clearly shows the superiority of EYLEA over laser treatment, with significant improvement in visual acuity and a reduction in the occurrence of macular edema. This presents a compelling opportunity for investment in Regeneron, as the potential for EYLEA in this indication is significant, with a large patient population in need of a more effective treatment option. Additionally, the ongoing PANORAMA and Protocol W studies in non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy further support the potential for EYLEA in this space, with the potential for regulatory submission in the first half of 2018. This presents a near-term catalyst for the company and supports an 'overweight' investment stance based on the potential for EYLEA to capture a significant share of the diabetic retinopathy market. Furthermore, the potential for combination studies with nesvacumab presents additional upside potential for the company, with top-line data expected later this quarter. In conclusion, the positive data and ongoing development of EYLEA and dupilumab present compelling opportunities for investment in Regeneron, and we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance based on the company's recent earnings call.
