Based on the recent earnings call and the company's commitment to simplifying and strengthening their business, it is evident that NRG is in a better position to execute on their strategic plan. The company has demonstrated strong results and execution in 2016, with a focus on cost reductions, asset dispositions, and strategic partnerships. The integrated platform of Generation, Renewables, and Retail provides stability and a natural hedge between Retail and Generation, allowing for strong, stable results despite challenging market conditions.

The company's cost reduction initiatives have exceeded targets, and they are currently working on the next round of cost-cutting initiatives through the Business Review Committee. Asset rebalancing and optimization efforts will continue in 2017, with a focus on monetizing assets at value to strengthen the balance sheet and drive greater shareholder value.

NRG's commitment to defending the integrity of competitive markets and vocal advocacy for competitive markets demonstrates their leadership in the industry. With a solid foundation and strategic priorities in place, the company is well positioned to benefit from market opportunities and drive greater shareholder value in the months and years to come.

Overall, based on the recent earnings call and the company's strategic initiatives, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on NRG. The company's strong results, focus on cost reduction, asset optimization, and commitment to competitive markets make it a compelling investment opportunity.
