. Thank you for your interest in NRG and sharing the financial commentary presented on the earnings call. It is clear that NRG has made significant progress in simplifying and streamlining its business, and has achieved strong financial results despite challenging market conditions. It is evident that the company is focused on reducing costs, optimizing its asset portfolio, and strengthening its balance sheet. 

However, as a financial analyst, adopting an 'underweight' investment stance may be appropriate based on the following key financial metrics:

1. Decline in Total Generation by 14% from 2015: While NRG has delivered on its numbers and achieved strong results, the decline in total generation could impact revenue and profitability in the future.

2. Cost Reductions and Asset Dispositions: While NRG has exceeded its cost reduction targets and successfully disposed of assets at value, the impact of these actions on the overall business and long-term financial performance remain to be seen.

3. Uncertain Market Environment: The competitive power sector is undergoing unprecedented disruption, and changes in fuel mix, technological innovation, and market conditions pose significant challenges for NRG's business model.

4. Regulatory Uncertainty: NRG's active defense of competitive markets and stance against out-of-market payments may lead to regulatory and political uncertainties that could impact the company's operations and financial performance.

While NRG's management has outlined its strategic priorities for 2017, the company's ability to navigate through these challenges and achieve sustainable long-term growth remains uncertain. As a result, an 'underweight' investment stance may be warranted until there is greater clarity on NRG's ability to address these key financial concerns and demonstrate sustained positive financial performance.
