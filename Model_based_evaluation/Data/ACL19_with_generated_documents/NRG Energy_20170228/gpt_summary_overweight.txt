Dear Stakeholders,

I am pleased to present to you a detailed summary report of NRG's recent earnings conference call transcript, outlining key financial metrics and our 'overweight' investment stance. The call was led by our CEO, who emphasized NRG's transformation over the past year and the significant progress made in simplifying our business, strengthening our platform, and restoring confidence in our decision making.

The key financial metrics highlighted in the call include strong results and execution in 2016, with increased adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow despite a challenging commodity price environment. Our Retail business delivered record adjusted EBITDA, demonstrating our ability to provide stable results in the face of market challenges. We have reaffirmed our 2017 financial guidance, demonstrating confidence in our future performance.

Significant progress has been made in cost reduction, with over $500 million in savings achieved in 2016, surpassing our initial target. We have also strengthened our balance sheet by reducing corporate debt and extending debt maturities. Our strategic partnership with NRG Yield has been reinvigorated, expanding our renewables business and ROFO pipeline.

Looking ahead, we are focusing on the next phase of our plan, benefitting from market opportunities and leveraging our integrated platform. NRG's unique value proposition centers on stability, proven by our diverse portfolio that minimizes exposure to market downturns. Approximately three-quarters of our gross margin in 2017 is expected to come from stable sources such as retail, contracted assets, and capacity revenues.

The competitive power sector is undergoing unprecedented disruption, and we believe that a flexible, transparent approach to capital allocation and a resilient capital structure are essential for long-term success. Our focus on operational excellence, cost reduction, and repositioning our portfolio will continue to drive greater shareholder value.

In addition, we have achieved significant cost savings across the organization, with a focus on assets dispositions at value and business optimization. Our integrated platform and strong operational and execution capabilities position us for continued success. We are committed to ongoing improvement and cost reduction across all areas of our business.

In summary, we are confident in NRG's outlook and believe that our integrated platform and strategic initiatives will drive sustained growth and value creation for our shareholders.

Thank you for your continued support and interest in NRG.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
