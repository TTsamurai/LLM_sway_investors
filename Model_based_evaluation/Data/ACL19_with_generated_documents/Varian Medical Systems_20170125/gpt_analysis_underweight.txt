Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, the company's financial performance appears to be mixed. While the oncology business has shown strong order growth and improved gross margins, Imaging Components is set to be spun off into a new public company, Varex Imaging. The company reported strong oncology global order growth of 10% and a four point improvement in its gross margin rate. However, there was a $76 million GAAP charge related almost exclusively to the California Proton Treatment Center (CPTC) in San Diego, which significantly impacted the company's earnings.

The company's particle therapy business recorded first quarter revenues of $30 million and took a $76 million GAAP charge, leading to a reserve of $38 million in accounts receivable and impairing $38 million of loans to CPTC. The charges reduced earnings by $0.64 per diluted share on a GAAP basis and by $0.34 per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis.

In terms of future outlook, the company is guiding for continuing operations revenue growth in the range of 4% to 5% for the second through fourth quarters of fiscal year 2017, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.94 to $3.06.

The company has also significantly reduced its exposure to particle therapy financing, with outstanding balances of $130 million across three centers, and is focusing exclusively on providing technology for cancer treatment.

Based on this information, adopting an 'underweight' investment stance may be prudent due to the company's mixed financial performance and the significant impact of the GAAP charge related to CPTC. Additionally, the spinoff of Imaging Components into a new public company may introduce new uncertainties and risks for the company's future financial performance.
