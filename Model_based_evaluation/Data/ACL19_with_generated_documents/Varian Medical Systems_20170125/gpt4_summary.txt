### Conclusion:
Varian demonstrated resilience in core operations, particularly in Oncology Systems and service business sectors, although faced significant challenges related to its proton therapy business segment. Moving forward, strategic shifts and operational fine-tuning are expected to better position Varian in its market, supported by a strong product pipeline and continued global expansion in oncology treatment solutions. The investor confidence remains cautiously optimistic with a keen eye on the proton therapy sector restructuring and the imminent spinoff of the Imaging Components division.
