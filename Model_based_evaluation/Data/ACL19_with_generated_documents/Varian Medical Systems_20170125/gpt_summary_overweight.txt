4. Orders: Strong oncology global order growth of 10%.

Overall, the company demonstrated strong performance in its oncology business, with strong orders and a positive market response to new products. Despite challenges related to the California Proton Treatment Center, the company remains focused on profitability and future growth. With a healthy sales funnel and promising outlook for the rest of fiscal year 2017, the company is well-positioned for continued success. As a financial analyst, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance for this company, considering its strong financial performance and growth potential in the oncology and imaging components businesses.
