As a stock promoter, based on the recent Quanta Services second quarter earnings call, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The recent earnings call provided operational and strategic commentary, indicating that Quanta Services remains on track to achieve its full-year guidance and multiyear outlook. Management believes that the company's end markets are strengthening, particularly in the electric power and oil and gas segments. They anticipate a solid year for the company in 2018 and 2019, with a renewed multiyear up-cycle.

In the electric power segment, Quanta Services has seen positive performance and remains confident in achieving margin expectations for the year. The recent announcement of a contract with American Electric Power for the Wind Catcher Generation Tie Line Project, the largest award in Quanta's history, is a testament to the company's industry-leading experience in constructing high-voltage electric transmission infrastructure. Additionally, the company continues to invest in workforce development and is actively pursuing opportunities for new large multiyear capital programs.

In the oil and gas segment, the company had a good second quarter and saw solid operating income margins. Quanta Services was recently awarded two spreads of the Canadian section of Enbridge's Line 3 Replacement Project, and they anticipate robust opportunities for larger pipeline projects pending FERC approval in 2018 and 2019. The recent acquisition of Stronghold, a leading specialized services company, is expected to provide opportunities for double-digit growth in the industry operating and capital spends.

The communications infrastructure services operations also continue to grow, with the company booking approximately $150 million of new project awards during the second quarter. Quanta Services remains positive about market expansion efforts and is actively pursuing opportunities with various U.S. telecom and cable MSOs. The strategic acquisition of an established communications contractor in the Southeast has allowed Quanta to strengthen its business and customer relationships in that region.

Overall, Quanta Services' unique operating model, industry-leading experience, and commitment to long-term growth position the company to capitalize on favorable end market trends. Management affirms the company's full-year outlook and remains confident in its ability to generate long-term value. Based on these insights, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Quanta Services, as the company's positive performance and growth opportunities in the electric power, oil and gas, and communications infrastructure services operations provide a compelling case for investment.
