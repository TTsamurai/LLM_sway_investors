Summary Report on Quanta Services Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call

Introduction:
Quanta Services provided operational and strategic commentary during the earnings conference call, highlighting the company's strong performance in the electric power, oil and gas, and communications infrastructure services operations. The company expressed optimism about the multiyear outlook and reaffirmed its full-year guidance.

Electric Power Segment:
The electric power segment showed strength, with investments in the workforce for electric distribution business creating short-term margin pressure. However, the company remains confident in achieving margin expectations for the year and improving operating margins in the long term. Quanta Services was selected for the Wind Catcher Generation Tie Line Project, which is the largest award in the company's history. The company is actively pursuing large transmission project opportunities and anticipates achieving record backlog levels in the next few quarters.

Oil and Gas Segment:
Quanta Services reported a good second quarter performance in the oil and gas segment, highlighting solid operating income margins and strong backlog. Significant project awards, such as the Canadian section of Enbridge's Line 3 Replacement Project, indicate improved expectations for booked pipeline work in the second half of the year. The company remains optimistic about the pipeline projects pending FERC approval and anticipates an active period in 2018 and 2019.

Communications Infrastructure Services:
The communications infrastructure services operations continued to grow, with new project awards in North America and favorable market expansion efforts. Quanta Services completed the strategic acquisition of an established communications contractor to accelerate its expansion efforts and capitalize on growth opportunities in North America and Latin America.

Financial Analysis and Stance:
The financial metrics of Quanta Services indicate a strong performance in the electric power, oil and gas, and communications infrastructure segments. The company's strategic initiatives and multiyear outlook provide a positive outlook for future growth. However, the timing of larger projects and FERC approval remains a challenge, impacting the predictability of project contracts and backlog. The recent acquisition of Stronghold and the company's growth opportunities in communications infrastructure services are positive factors.

Given the challenges related to the timing of project contracts and FERC approval, as well as the potential impact of market dynamics on major projects, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended for Quanta Services. This stance reflects an assessment of the risks and uncertainties associated with the company's ability to predict and secure larger projects, despite its overall positive performance and outlook in the industry.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, Quanta Services' second quarter earnings conference call showcased the company's strength in its core businesses and strategic initiatives. While the company has promising growth opportunities in the electric power, oil and gas, and communications infrastructure services operations, the challenges related to project contracts and regulatory approvals warrant a cautious investment approach. An 'underweight' stance takes into account the uncertainties and potential impact on the company's financial performance in the medium term.

This concludes the detailed summary report on Quanta Services' second quarter 2017 earnings conference call, adopting an 'underweight' investment stance.
