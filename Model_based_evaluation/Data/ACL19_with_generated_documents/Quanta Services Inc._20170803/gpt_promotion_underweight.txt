Based on the recent earnings call transcript provided, here are some reasons to recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on Quanta Services:

1. Uncertainty around project contracts: Despite optimism about the 2018 and 2019 outlook, the timing of when project contracts are signed and reflected in the company's backlog can be challenging to predict. This uncertainty could impact future revenue and growth projections.

2. Regulatory challenges: The lack of commissioner quorum at FERC is affecting the ability to obtain final approval for major projects, including pipelines. This could lead to delays in project awards and construction, impacting the company's financial performance.

3. Market variability: The oil and gas segment backlog can vary due to its faster book and burn nature, as well as the timing of larger pipeline project awards. This variability introduces risk and unpredictability to the company's revenue stream.

4. Execution challenges: The company's investments in workforce and infrastructure projects may create short-term margin pressure, and there have been difficulties in predicting larger transmission project awards. This could impact the company's ability to meet margin expectations and achieve growth targets.

5. Acquisition impact: While the recent acquisition of Stronghold is seen as a strategic move, the acquisition impact on the company's financials and growth potential is still uncertain. Integration and cross-selling efforts may not deliver immediate results, adding another layer of risk.

Overall, the cautious or skeptical perspective on Quanta Services is based on the uncertainties surrounding regulatory approvals, project contracts, market variability, execution challenges, and the impact of recent acquisitions on the company's financial performance. These factors justify an 'underweight' investment stance until there is more clarity and stability in the company's operations and outlook.
