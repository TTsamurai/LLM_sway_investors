**Future Outlook Report**

**Company: GGP Inc.**

**Investment Stance: Overweight**

**Executive Summary:**
GGP Inc. displays a robust financial and operational position in the retail real estate sector, underpinned by consistent financial performance, strategic asset management, and proactive leasing activities. The company's emphasis on high-quality A assets, buoyant leasing metrics, and strategic capital deployment enhances its portfolio quality and positions it favorably for sustainable growth. Given the company's compelling performance metrics, strong guidance, and a proven resilience to shifts in the retail landscape, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance.

**1. Financial Performance:**
GGP reported a first-quarter FFO per diluted share of $0.36, aligning with both guidance and consensus estimates. The company's same-store NOI grew by 2.9%, and EBITDA increased by 3.7% during the quarter. Such performance indicators underscore GGP's operational efficiency and effective resource management amid a challenging retail environment. Additionally, the board declared a $0.22 per share quarterly dividend, marking a 16% increase year-over-year, signaling strong cash flow generation and the company’s commitment to returning value to shareholders.

**2. Portfolio Management:**
Despite a minor dip in occupancy (95.9% from 96.1% year-over-year) mostly due to tenant bankruptcies, GGP has successfully re-leased approximately 80% of affected space, demonstrating agility in its leasing strategy. Historical data suggests a strong recovery pattern, as seen in 2015 following similar challenges. Looking ahead, management’s proactive leasing strategy, particularly of identifying and addressing potential tenant bankruptcies, positions the portfolio for minimal disruptions and sustained high occupancy.

**3. Focused Growth in High-Quality Assets:**
GGP's intentional focus on A assets—constituting about 80% of NOI with a notable 4% growth including bankruptcies—strengths its market position. The NOI-weighted sales and lease spreads exhibit increases, indicative of the high quality and robust demand for the company's portfolio. Furthermore, substantial growth initiatives, such as the redevelopment of anchor spaces and exploration of mixed-use components (entertainment, dining), align with evolving consumer preferences and real estate trends.

**4. Strategic Developments and Expansions:**
Notable development projects like the expansion and redevelopment at Staten Island Mall and the SoNo Collection promise to elevate the company's profile and financial metrics. These projects are predominantly pre-leased, reflecting strong retailer demand and confidence in GGP's locations. The company's strategy to incorporate diverse offerings (e.g., entertainment and dining) should drive foot traffic and tenant sales.

**5. Shareholder Value Focus:**
Amid a backdrop of a perceived undervaluation in public markets relative to private market valuations, GGP's active review of strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value is pivotal. The management’s open approach in assessing various asset monetization strategies, combined with active stock repurchase activities, emphasizes its commitment to aligning market valuation with intrinsic asset worth. 

**6. Risk Management and Outlook:**
Navigating tenant bankruptcies and evolving retail landscapes requires vigilant management and flexible strategy adaptation—areas where GGP has consistently demonstrated competence. The forward guidance and ongoing strategic initiatives suggest a promising outlook despite sectoral challenges.

**Conclusion:**
Given GGP Inc.'s robust operational foundation, strategic asset focus, and proactive management of market and operational risks, the company's stock presents a compelling buy opportunity for investors seeking exposure to high-quality retail real estate with growth potential. We advise an 'overweight' position, anticipating that GGP's strategic initiatives will result in sustained growth and return on investment.
