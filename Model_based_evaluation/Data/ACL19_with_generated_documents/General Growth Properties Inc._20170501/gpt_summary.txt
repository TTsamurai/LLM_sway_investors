Dear [Recipient],

Please find below a detailed summary report on the recent earnings conference call transcripts for your review:

Company FFO per diluted share for the first quarter was $0.36, consistent with guidance and consensus. Same-store NOI growth was 2.9% and EBITDA growth was 3.7%. The guidance for 2017 is $1.56 to $1.60 per share, with a midpoint of $1.58, consistent with consensus.

The board declared a dividend of $0.22 for the quarter, representing a 16% increase from the same quarter last year. The portfolio was 95.9% leased at quarter-end, with 80% re-leased of the space affected by tenant bankruptcies.

Operating metrics remained strong, with a focus on high-quality retail real estate in the U.S. The same-store NOI growth for A assets in the portfolio for the year is projected to be 4%. Apparel sales decreased by 1.8%, while sales in other categories, excluding apparel, increased by 3.8%.

The retail property landscape sees high-quality centers continuing to thrive. Demand is seen from grocery stores, cinemas, innovative entertainment venues, fitness centers, and more. The company is also expanding and redeveloping centers to include a variety of tenants such as ZARA, Shake Shack, and KidZania.

In terms of financial metrics, the business prioritizes shareholder value and is evaluating all strategic alternatives to bridge the gap between the current market capitalization and the value of the company's real estate assets. The company is considering options such as asset sales, share buybacks, and partnerships with institutional investors.

The portfolio includes 65 million square feet of anchor space, with a focus on redeveloping department store boxes to generate incremental income and improve centers. The company is also raising capital to invest in acquiring, redeveloping, and re-tenanting anchor space.

The priorities include focusing on high-quality regional shopping centers and identifying growth opportunities through redevelopment, leaseback arrangements, and potential sale of assets to unlock shareholder value.

Please let me know if you require any further information or if you have any specific questions about the report. I am available for discussions at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
