**Stock Promotion Report: Overweight Recommendation for GGP Inc.**

**Executive Summary:**
As we assess the current landscape of the retail industry, GGP Inc. (GGP) stands out as an exemplary investment opportunity. Recent financial and operational results highlighted in the latest earnings call provide a strong case for an overweight investment recommendation. Our analysis is driven by impressive core business performance, strategic asset management, and robust development activities which collectively enhance GGP’s appeal to both investors and tenants.

**1. Robust Financial Performance:**
GGP reported a first-quarter FFO per diluted share of $0.36, in line with guidance and consensus estimates. The company has shown commendable same-store NOI growth of 2.9% and EBITDA growth of 3.7%. With guidance set at $1.56 to $1.60 for the full year, the company remains consistent and reliable in its performance. Furthermore, the declaration of a dividend at $0.22 per quarter, representing a 16% increase year-over-year, underscores GGP’s commitment to delivering shareholder value.

**2. Strategic Asset Management:**
GGP controls 100 million square feet of prime retail space across its top 100 assets, which account for approximately 95% of the company’s NOI. Despite challenges including tenant bankruptcies, GGP has successfully re-leased nearly 80% of affected spaces. Historical recovery rates and active asset management strategies indicate GGP's capability to maintain high occupancy levels and drive portfolio performance.

**3. Aggressive Leasing and Tenant Diversification:**
GGP’s leasing strategy focusing on high-quality ‘A’ assets which constitute 80% of NOI, with a 4% growth forecast including bankruptcy impacts, has borne fruit. The company reported NOI-weighted lease spreads increasing by 15.5%. GGP is also diversifying its tenant mix, bringing in high-demand sectors like grocery stores, fitness centers, and entertainment venues which contribute to increased traffic and sales per square foot in their properties.

**4. Development and Redevelopment Initiatives:**
GGP is highly proactive in its development strategy, with the SoNo Collection project notably pre-leased at 50% and exhibitions of compelling rent figures indicative of high sales productivity expectations. Simultaneously, GGP is investing between $300 and $400 million annually in the redevelopment of anchor spaces to augment earnings potential.

**5. Strategic Financial Positioning:**
GGP’s strategic financial management is evident in its stock buyback activities and careful capital allocation. The company’s leaders have emphasized that the current market valuation does not fully reflect the intrinsic value of its high-quality assets, suggesting a potential for significant upside in investment returns as strategic initiatives unfold.

**Conclusion:**
GGP Inc. presents a compelling buy and overweight position for investors looking for exposure to top-tier retail real estate with a robust strategic direction. The company’s adaptability in a transforming retail landscape, combined with strong asset management, financial discipline, and growth-oriented initiatives, positions it to outperform in the retail sector. Consequently, we recommend an overweight stance in GGP Inc. as it continues to demonstrate its ability to thrive and deliver shareholder value amidst industry challenges.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue monitoring quarterly earnings and strategic progress.
- Engage with GGP management in investor meetings to gain further insights.
- Review the impact of broader economic factors on retail and real estate sectors that might affect GGP.

Consider this an essential opportunity to capitalize on a well-managed, growth-oriented retail property company that is set to outperform expectations and industry standards.
