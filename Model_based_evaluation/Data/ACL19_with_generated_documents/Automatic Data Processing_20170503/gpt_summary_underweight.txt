Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, there are several key financial metrics that indicate a potential for an 'underweight' investment stance. The highlights include:

1. Revenue Growth: ADP reported a 5% growth in revenues for the quarter, which experienced pressure due to the lapping of fiscal year 2016 ACA-related revenues.

2. Pre-tax Earnings: Pre-tax earnings from continuing operations before taxes grew 4% to $828 million. Adjusted EBIT grew 4%, with a 20 basis points decrease in adjusted EBIT margin.

3. Net Earnings and EPS: Net earnings grew 10% to $588 million, with diluted earnings per share growing 12% to $1.31. However, these numbers were bolstered by a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared to a year ago.

4. New Business Bookings: New business bookings performance for the quarter was disappointing, with a 7% decline. The company also revised its new business bookings guidance for fiscal year 2017 to decline about 5% to 7% compared to the previous year.

5. Revenue Outlook: Despite revised new business bookings guidance and revenue retention decline, ADP's revenue outlook remains unchanged at about 6%.

6. Client Funds and Interest Revenue: ADP expects growth in client funds interest revenue to increase by about $20 million, and the total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy is expected to be up about $15 million.

7. Effective Tax Rate and EPS Guidance: The company revised its adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 to 31.4%, down from the prior forecasted rate of 32.4%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow 13% to 14%, compared to the previous forecast of 11% to 13%.

Based on these key financial metrics, it is advisable to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for ADP, as the company's revenue growth is under pressure, new business bookings performance is disappointing, and there are uncertainties regarding the effective tax rate and EPS guidance. Additionally, the company's forecast for fiscal year 2017 reflects challenges in revenue retention and new business bookings, which may impact future growth prospects.
