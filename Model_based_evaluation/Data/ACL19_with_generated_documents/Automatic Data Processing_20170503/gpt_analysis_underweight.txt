Based on the transcript from the recent earnings conference call, it is evident that ADP has experienced pressure on its revenue growth as a result of various factors, including the sale of CHSA and COBRA businesses, slower revenue growth, and a decline in new business bookings. Although the company remains confident in its competitive portfolio and distribution capabilities, the disappointing new business bookings performance and slower revenue growth indicate potential challenges for future growth.

Key financial metrics derived from the transcript include a 5% growth in revenues on a reported basis, 6% organic growth, and a 4% growth in pre-tax earnings from continuing operations before taxes. Additionally, the effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2017 has been revised to 31.4%, resulting in an expected 13% to 14% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share compared to the prior forecast of 11% to 13%.

Despite maintaining investments in product sales and service, including dual operations cost related to the service alignment initiative, the company anticipates a margin expansion of about 50 basis points in consolidated adjusted EBIT margins. However, the slower revenue growth and continued investments in the sales organization indicate potential challenges for margin expansion in the short term.

The company has revised its new business bookings guidance for fiscal year 2017 to decline about 5% to 7% compared to the previous year, signaling a potential impact on future revenue growth. Furthermore, uncertainties related to political and regulatory environments, as well as potential pull forward of business due to events such as ACA, have contributed to the decline in new business bookings.

In light of these insights and financial metrics, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for ADP, as the company's future growth prospects may face challenges due to slower revenue growth, declining new business bookings, and potential uncertainties in the regulatory and political environment.

It is important to closely monitor the company's execution of its core strategic initiatives, product development capabilities, and sales force effectiveness to assess future growth potential and investment attractiveness. Additionally, monitoring the impact of the service alignment initiative and the potential completion of dual operations in 2018 will be crucial for evaluating the company's margin expansion prospects.
