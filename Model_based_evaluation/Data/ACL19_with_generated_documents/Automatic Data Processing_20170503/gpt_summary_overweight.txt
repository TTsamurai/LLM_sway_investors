 for attending today's earnings conference call. Based on the detailed summary of the earnings transcript, I believe that ADP is in a strong position for future growth and profitability. The company's strong financial metrics, such as revenue growth, pre-tax earnings, adjusted EBIT margin, net earnings, and diluted earnings per share, all show positive growth and stability.

Despite some pressure on revenue growth from ACA-related revenues and other business dispositions, ADP has shown resilience and continued growth in key areas such as Employer Services and PEO revenues. The company's focus on investment in sales organization and distribution capabilities, as well as its strategic forecasting for revenue retention and margin expansion, indicates a strong commitment to long-term growth and stability.

Although there have been challenges in new business bookings and some external factors impacting revenue growth, such as political uncertainty and migration impacts, the company's confidence in its competitive portfolio, distribution capabilities, and ongoing investments in sales indicate a positive outlook for the future.

Furthermore, the company's updated forecast for fiscal year 2017, including margin expansion, effective tax rate, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and return of excess cash to shareholders, demonstrates a proactive and strategic approach to financial management and investor confidence.

In light of the positive financial metrics and the company's strategic outlook, I am adopting an 'overweight' investment stance for ADP, as I believe that the company is well-positioned for future growth and profitability.
