 for your detailed report on the recent earnings conference call transcripts. Based on the information provided, here are the key financial metrics to focus on:

Revenue Growth: ADP's revenues for the quarter grew 5% on a reported basis and 6% organically. This growth was impacted by the lapping of fiscal year 2016 ACA-related revenues.

Pre-Tax Earnings: Pre-tax earnings from continuing operations before taxes grew 4% on a reported basis to $828 million, despite pressure from business dispositions and acquisitions.

Adjusted EBIT and Margin: Adjusted EBIT grew 4%, and the adjusted EBIT margin decreased by 20 basis points compared to last year's third quarter. Margins were impacted by slower revenue growth and investments in product sales and service.

Net Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share: Net earnings grew 10% to $588 million, and diluted earnings per share grew 12% to $1.31, benefiting from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding.

New Business Bookings: New business bookings performance for the quarter was disappointing, down 7%. ADP has continued to make investments in its sales organization to position for future growth.

Employer Services Segment: Revenues for the segment grew 2% on a reported basis, and the segment's margin decreased about 40 basis points in the quarter. Average client fund balances grew 2% on a reported basis.

PEO Segment: PEO revenues grew 12% in the quarter, with average worksite employees growing 12% to 471,000. The PEO margins continued to expand through operational efficiencies.

Revenue Outlook: ADP's revenue outlook for fiscal year 2017 remains unchanged at about 6%, with adjusted EBIT margin expansion expected to be about 50 basis points.

Adjusted Effective Tax Rate: The adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 is now estimated to be 31.4%, resulting in expected adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 13% to 14%.

Share Repurchases: ADP's forecast includes a return of excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion during fiscal year 2017, subject to market conditions.

Overall, while the new business bookings performance was disappointing, ADP remains confident in the competitiveness of its portfolio and is continuing to invest in its sales organization for future growth opportunities. The company expects to continue its focus on driving operational efficiencies and financial performance in the upcoming fiscal year.
