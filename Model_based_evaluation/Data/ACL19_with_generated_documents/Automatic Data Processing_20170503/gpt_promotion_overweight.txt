Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company's revenues for the quarter grew by 5% on a reported basis and 6% organic, despite pressure from lapping fiscal year 2016 ACA-related revenues. Pre-tax earnings from continuing operations before taxes grew by 4% on a reported basis to $828 million, and adjusted EBIT grew 4%. The company's margins were impacted by slower revenue growth due to investments in product sales and service, including dual operations costs related to service alignment initiatives. Despite disappointing new business bookings performance this quarter, the company's revenue outlook remains unchanged at about 6%. The management has also updated certain elements of their fiscal 2017 forecast, including adjusted EBIT margin expansion, client funds interest revenue, and adjusted effective tax rate. The company continues to expect growth in client funds interest revenue and a return of excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases. Despite revised new business bookings guidance, the company's longer-term expectations for organic growth remain at 7% to 9%, driven by a growth of new business bookings in the range of 8% to 10%. The company's competitive position remains strong in the market, and they continue to invest in their sales force and strategic platforms for future growth. Therefore, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended based on the company's strong financial performance and forward-looking strategies.
