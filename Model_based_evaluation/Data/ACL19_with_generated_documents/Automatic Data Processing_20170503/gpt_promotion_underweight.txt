The recent earnings call for ADP has highlighted several concerning factors that should give investors pause. The company's revenue growth has experienced pressure due to the lapping of fiscal year 2016 ACA-related revenues, resulting in slower revenue growth and decreased margins. The new business bookings performance for the quarter was disappointing, with a 7% decline, and the company now expects new business bookings for fiscal year 2017 to decline about 5% to 7% compared to the previous year. Additionally, the impact of lower state unemployment insurance collections has affected client fund balances.

The company has revised certain elements of its fiscal 2017 forecast, including a downward adjustment to its effective tax rate guidance. The adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow 13% to 14%, reflecting a decrease from the previous forecast. The company also anticipates a return of excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases, subject to market conditions.

The CEO acknowledged that there are multiple factors contributing to the decline in new business bookings, including the lapping of ACA-related sales, political uncertainty, and a potential pull forward of business due to the Affordable Care Act. The company's long-term growth outlook remains at 7% to 9%, driven by growth of new business bookings in the range of 8% to 10%. However, the current decline in new business bookings is a cause for concern.

In light of these factors, it is recommended that investors take an 'underweight' investment stance on ADP. The company's recent performance and forecast revisions indicate potential challenges ahead, and caution should be exercised when considering investment in ADP.
