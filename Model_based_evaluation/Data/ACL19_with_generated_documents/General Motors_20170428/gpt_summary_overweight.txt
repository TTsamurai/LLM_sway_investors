in the call. And with that, operator, we're ready for the first question.

Dear Stakeholders,

We are pleased to report on the recent earnings conference call transcript, where GM delivered a very strong quarter that set several Q1 records. The key financial metrics for the quarter include:

- Net revenue of $41.2 billion, up from $37.3 billion year-over-year
- Net income of $2.6 billion, up 34% from $2 billion
- EBIT-adjusted of $3.4 billion, up from $2.7 billion
- EBIT-adjusted margin of 8.2%, up from 7.1%
- EPS diluted-adjusted of $1.70, up from $1.26
- Automotive-adjusted free cash flow of negative $600 million, increased by $800 million
- ROIC-adjusted of 29.7% on a trailing four-quarter basis
- Sale of Opel and Vauxhall brands and GM Financial's European operations to PSA Group for about $2.2 billion
- Sale expected to close later this year and immediately improve EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins
- GMNA and GM China drove Q1 results with new and refreshed crossovers and strong retail sales
- Record March retail sales in China and plans to introduce more than 10 new energy vehicles between 2016 and 2020
- Expected significant year-over-year improvement in South America in 2017
- Investments in autonomous vehicles, electrification, and connectivity, with plans to introduce more than 10 new energy vehicles between 2016 and 2020
- $14 million investment in a new research and development facility in San Francisco
- Super Cruise, the industry's first true hands-free highway driving technology, to be available later this year on the 2018 Cadillac CT6 sedan
- Unlimited data plan offering with more than 100,000 plans sold

We are adopting an 'overweight' investment stance based on the strong financial performance and strategic actions taken by GM to drive earnings growth. The company's focus on key markets with leading franchises, relentless pursuit of efficiencies, and disciplined capital allocation framework is positioning GM for sustained performance and growth.

The sale of Opel and Vauxhall brands and GM Financial's European operations to PSA Group will immediately improve financial metrics and de-risk the balance sheet, indicating a positive impact on future financial performance.

GM's efforts in developing autonomous vehicles, electrification, and connectivity also demonstrate a forward-thinking approach to future technologies and market applications.

The company's dedication to transforming transportation and leveraging its leadership position in the industry signals a commitment to delivering long-term value to shareholders.

We believe that GM's strong performance, strategic investments, and focus on transformative technologies justify an 'overweight' investment stance, as the company is well-positioned for continued growth and success.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
Financial Analyst
