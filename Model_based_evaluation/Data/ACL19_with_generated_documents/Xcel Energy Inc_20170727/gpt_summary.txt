Based on the earnings conference call transcripts, the key financial metrics that are important to focus on include earnings per share, electric and natural gas margins, effective income tax rate, O&M expenses, regulatory approvals for rate cases and multi-year plans, and the company's 2017 earnings guidance. The earnings per share increased from $0.39 per share in 2016 to $0.45 per share in 2017, driven by higher electric and natural gas margins, lower effective income tax rate, and lower O&M expenses. Sales of both electric and natural gas showed improvement year-to-date, reflecting customer growth and partially offset by lower use per customer.

The company made significant progress on regulatory approvals, with successful multi-year electric rate case settlements in Minnesota and advanced grid proposals in Colorado. The company also filed rate cases in Wisconsin and Colorado and plans to file electric cases in Colorado, Texas, and New Mexico in the coming months. The company is well-positioned to deliver on its 2017 earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.35 per share and has a 4% to 6% earnings growth objective and a 5% to 7% dividend growth objective.

Additionally, the company is working on wind projects in Minnesota, with a proposed spend of about $1.6 billion, which would increase its rate base and is seeking concurrent recovery for the investment. The company is also focused on working through settlements with counterparties to benefit customers by reducing fuel costs.

Overall, the company had an excellent quarter with strong financial results and is making progress on its regulatory and operational initiatives to drive growth. These key financial metrics and developments from the conference call transcripts provide important insights for analysts and investors in evaluating the company's performance and future prospects.
