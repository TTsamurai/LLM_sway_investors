. And that's why you see the increase in spending on scalable infrastructure and line extensions in our Cable Communications capital expenditures. And as we mentioned earlier, we continue to expect capital intensity to remain flat to 2016 at approximately 15% of total Cable Communications revenue for the full year. And now, I'll turn it over to Dave for any additional comments.

In conclusion, based on the strong second quarter results, it is clear that the company is experiencing significant growth and success across its different business segments. From the increase in revenue and EBITDA at Cable Communications and NBCUniversal, to the growth in customer relationships and capital expenditures, the company is well-positioned for continued success. In addition, the positive outlook for the remainder of the year, with expectations of flat EBITDA margin and continued growth in high-margin businesses, indicates that the company is on the right track for long-term profitability.

Based on these factors, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. This recommendation is supported by the company's ability to weather the competitive environment, its continuous investments in customer service initiatives, and its strong free cash flow generation. With a promising outlook and a track record of success, we believe that the company presents a compelling opportunity for investors to consider.
