#### **Investment Stance: Underweight**
Given the outlined reasons associated with increased competitive pressures, rising costs, and operational risks, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended. While the company exhibits solid growth trajectories in certain segments, the underlying challenges in maintaining video customer base and elevated capital expenditures necessary for technological advancements suggest potential headwinds that could affect the long-term profitability and market positioning. 

Investors are advised to exercise caution, giving greater consideration to the aspects of cost management, competitive response, and long-term value generation from recent strategic investments like acquisitions and network infrastructure improvements.
