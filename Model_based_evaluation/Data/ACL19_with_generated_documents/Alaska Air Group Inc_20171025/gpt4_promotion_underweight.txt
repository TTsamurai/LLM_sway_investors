Subject: Investment Report - Recommendation: Underweight on Air Group

Dear Investors,

Following a detailed review of Air Group's recent earnings call and current operational trajectory, we recommend adopting an ‘underweight’ stance on the company’s stock. Our cautious position is predicated on several key financial and operational concerns detailed below:

1. **Modest Profit Growth Amid Rising Costs**: Despite Air Group posting a $278 million adjusted profit for the third quarter—an increase of $6 million from the previous year—the growth is modest considering the scale of operations. More worrying is the trend in operating costs: fuel costs spiked by 23% ($70 million), and non-fuel costs rose by $97 million. The unit costs excluding fuel rose by 1%, despite a 7% increase in available seat miles (ASM). The slim profit growth juxtaposed against sharp rises in costs pressures the operating margin substantially.

2. **Deferred Costs and Upcoming Financial Burdens**: There is a notable deferral of costs, particularly in maintenance which is now shifted to the fourth quarter. This accounting maneuver could lead to amplified expenses in the near future. Additionally, costs are expected to surge owing to a new engine services deal with GE, integration activities, a significant arbitration result with mainline pilots, and increased advertising and promotional activity. These factors collectively suggest potential margin compression ahead.

3. **Capacity and Demand Concerns**: While ASM growth is substantial, the company has had to curb capacity increases from the previously projected 8.5% down to 7.2%. This revision reflects underlying issues in optimizing capacity with actual demand. Moreover, close-in capacity reductions on the regional side will likely exacerbate unit cost pressures due to fixed costs spreading over fewer ASMs.

4. **Integration Challenges**: The ongoing integration with Virgin America presents its own set of financial frictions and operational complexities. Integration-related costs, though not explicitly captured in external profit and loss statements, are real and substantial. The full realization of projected synergies could be slower than expected, impacting short to mid-term financial performance.

5. **Liquidity and Cash Flow Pressures**: Despite strong indications of cash and operating cash flow, the company disclosed a “free cash deficit” due to timing of capital expenditures. With CapEx expected to rise from $1.1 billion in 2017 to $1.4 billion in 2018, coupled with ongoing high expenditure and rising debt levels, liquidity might be tighter than it appears, potentially affecting future financial flexibility.

6. **Market Competition and Operational Disruptions**: Air Group faces intense competition in the airline industry where operational efficiency and cost management are key. The reported operational disruptions, leading to incremental costs, underscore vulnerabilities in operational resilience which is critical in this sector.

Conclusion:
Given the outlined concerns, particularly around cost management, deferral and increase of future expenses, and ongoing integration challenges, we deem it prudent to adopt an 'underweight' stance on Air Group’s stock at this juncture. Continuous monitoring of the company’s financial health and operational performance remains imperative to reassess our stance as new data becomes available.
