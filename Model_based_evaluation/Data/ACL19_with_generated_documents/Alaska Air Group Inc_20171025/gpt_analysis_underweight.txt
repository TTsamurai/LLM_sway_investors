Based on the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, here are key insights and financial metrics that support an 'underweight' investment stance for Air Group:

1. Rising Costs: The company highlighted significant increases in fuel costs, non-fuel costs, and unit costs ex-fuel. Operational disruptions at airports and call centers also led to additional costs during the quarter. The company expects unit costs to be up about 1.5% in the fourth quarter.

2. Impact on Pre-Tax Margins: The cost increases and disruptions are expected to impact pre-tax margins negatively, reducing them by more than 1.5 points.

3. Additional Cost Pressures in 2018: The company expects costs to rise further in 2018 due to factors such as a new engine services deal, growing mix of regional flying, and integration-related costs that are not captured in the merger-related cost line.

4. Free Cash Flow Deficit: The company acknowledged a free cash deficit in the recent quarter, attributing it to seasonality combined with the timing of capital expenses.

5. Uncertain Near-Term Outlook: The management expressed frustration and anxiety about the current state of the business, indicating tough conversations and a need for a plan to transition to a better position.

6. Reluctance to Renegotiate Deals: The company indicated satisfaction with its contract with BofA and stated that there are no plans to renegotiate the deal, despite the need to attract more members to the Alaska Airlines credit card.

Based on these insights and financial metrics, an 'underweight' investment stance is appropriate. The company is facing significant cost pressures, a free cash flow deficit, and uncertainty in the near-term outlook. The reluctance to renegotiate deals also raises concerns about the company's ability to address challenges effectively.
