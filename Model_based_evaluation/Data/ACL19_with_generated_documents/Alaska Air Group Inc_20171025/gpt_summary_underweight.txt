 of the program. It's also consistent with the strategy of Alaska today, and I'll remind you that before the Virgin America acquisition, we had $500 million in EBITBDA, and one of the main drivers of that was the credit card program. So, now it's a bigger base, and we'll continue to take advantage of that as long as we can maintain our strong position with BofA.

Summary Report:

Alaska Air Group posted a $278 million third quarter adjusted profit, which was a $6 million increase from last year's adjusted Q3 result. However, on a comparative basis, when factoring in Virgin America's third quarter of 2016 in the base, the result was $68 million or 13% lower than last year.

Costs have increased significantly, with fuel costs up by $70 million or 23%, and non-fuel costs rising by $97 million. Operational disruptions also resulted in approximately $6 million of incremental costs during the quarter, with airports and call centers being heavily impacted.

Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, unit costs are expected to be up about 1.5% on an 11% increase in capacity. This increase in costs is driven by several factors, including a new engine services deal with GE, planned maintenance activities, advertising and promotional activities, and capacity reductions on the regional side.

The company is also facing additional cost pressures in 2018, including the impact of a mainline pilot arbitration, maintenance deal expenses, and growing mix of regional flying. These cost pressures are expected to result in rising costs in 2018.

On the positive side, the company's cash flow remains strong, and they have generated $1.4 billion of operating cash flow excluding merger-related expenses since the start of the year. The company continues to focus on reducing debt and has lowered their debt-to-cap ratio by 6 points since completing the acquisition of Virgin America.

In terms of capital allocation, the company has completed its plan to repurchase $50 million worth of shares in 2017 and has also paid $111 million in dividends so far this year.

In conclusion, although the company faced cost pressures and a challenging fare environment, they remain optimistic about their future prospects. However, based on the information provided, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance due to the expected rise in costs in 2018 and the ongoing challenges in the fare and demand environment.
