Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on Air Group. Despite some near-term cost pressures, the company posted a solid third quarter profit and continues to generate strong cash flow. The company is also making progress in reducing its debt-to-cap ratio and is on track to achieve its long-term target. Additionally, the new engine services deal with GE and the growth of regional flying are expected to help offset some of the cost pressures in the future. The company's strong financial position and commitment to cost control give it a significant competitive advantage over its competitors. Overall, the company's long-term growth prospects and commitment to financial discipline make it an attractive investment opportunity.
