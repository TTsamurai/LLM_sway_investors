The company has demonstrated solid growth, with a 10% increase in total company revenue compared to the previous quarter. North American revenue outpaced the industry average, showing an increase of 14% and indicating strong market share growth. Additionally, the completion and production division showed a 13% revenue increase and a 215 basis point margin expansion, despite the impact of Hurricane Harvey. The company's international operations show a more conservative outlook, as customers focus on lowering costs and increasing efficiency in response to market conditions.

The company's strategy to focus on achieving normalized margins through a combination of increasing pricing, improving equipment utilization, and reducing costs is yielding positive results. Halliburton's approach to capital allocation, cost control, and investments in technology demonstrates a commitment to driving returns and generating cash flow, even in a range-bound commodity price environment.
