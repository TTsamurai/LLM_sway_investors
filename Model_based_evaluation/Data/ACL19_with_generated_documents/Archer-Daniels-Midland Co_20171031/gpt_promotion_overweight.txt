 based on different factors. Overall, the quarter results were impacted by a variety of factors, including lower operating profit, decreased handles volumes, and a lack of correlation between hedges and underlying movements. Despite these challenges, the company's strong ownership position and favorable environment for ownership provides confidence in future performance.

Based on the recent earnings call, the company's adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.45, and their trailing four-quarter-average ROIC of 6.4% generated positive EVA of $98 million on a four-quarter-trailing-average basis. Additionally, the company reported good visibility and strong ownership for the fourth quarter and into 2018. 

It is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on the company based on the potential for growth in the domestic market, global demand for protein, and the favorable environment for ownership and merchandise opportunities. The company's solid balance sheet with net debt to total capital ratio of about 27% also provides a strong foundation for future performance.
