Based on the provided transcript of the recent earnings conference call, it is evident that the company has experienced a decrease in adjusted EPS and segment operating profit compared to the prior year's quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was lower than the forecasted annual rate, partially due to certain favorable discrete items. Additionally, the company's trailing four-quarter-average ROIC is higher than the previous year and above the 2017 annual WACC, resulting in a positive EVA.

The balance sheet remains solid, with net debt to total capital ratio at around 27% and shareholders' equity similar to the previous year. The company has also returned capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

In terms of business performance, the Oilseeds segment has been impacted by factors such as South American crop pressure and currency movements, leading to lower results in Q3. Similarly, Ag Services experienced lower handling volumes, resulting in lower margins. However, the company remains confident in the long-term demand for protein and sees potential for improvement in the fourth quarter and into 2018.

The company's position in the ethanol market is also noted, with expectations of incremental growth in Mexico and modest growth in exports for the next year.

Based on this analysis, an 'underweight' investment stance may be suitable due to the challenges faced by the company in various segments, as well as the impact of external factors such as currency movements and handling volumes. It is important to closely monitor the company's ability to address these challenges and capitalize on potential growth opportunities.
