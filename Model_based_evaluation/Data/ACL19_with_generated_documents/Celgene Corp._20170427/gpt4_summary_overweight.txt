### Executive Summary:
Our review of the first quarter financial results for the Hematology and Oncology franchise reveals a robust performance, supporting an overweight investment stance. This decision is based on strong year-over-year and sequential growth, critical regulatory milestones reached, and promising developments in the product pipeline.

### Financial Performance Highlights:
1. **Net Sales Growth**:
   - **REVLIMID**: Demonstrated a 20% increase year-over-year and 4% growth quarter-over-quarter, driven by both newly diagnosed and repeat prescription increases. This growth occurred despite traditional Q1 challenges. International sales also saw a 24% year-over-year boost, with volume growth rates of 22% year-over-year internationally.
   - **POMALYST/IMNOVID**: Net sales rose by 33% year-over-year, though a 1% decline quarter-over-quarter was observed, reflecting slight inventory fluctuations and a coverage gap impact.
   - **ABRAXANE**: Reported a 5% increase year-over-year, though faced an 11% quarterly decline due to typical Q1 U.S. buying patterns. The brand holds strong in key cancer markets including pancreatic, breast, and lung cancers.

2. **Market Expansion and Share**:
   - Continued expansion in non-U.S. markets, especially in the EU and Japan, for REVLIMID. The drug is also now reimbursed in several new markets, expanding its global reach.
   - Both REVLIMID and POMALYST/IMNOVID maintain market-leading positions in their respective therapeutic areas, underscoring robust demand and increased treatment durations.

### Strategic Developments:
1. **Regulatory Advancements**:
   - Approval of REVLIMID as a maintenance therapy post-autologous stem cell transplantation in the U.S. and EU, with positive reimbursement trajectory in six European markets.
   - Anticipation of FDA approval for POMALYST in combination with daratumumab for relapsed refractory myeloma anticipated by June of this year.

2. **Pipeline Progress**:
   - The completion of Phase III OPTIMISMM trial enrollment for POMALYST/IMNOVID, with results expected in 2018.
   - Initiatives to submit an sNDA for RVd in both transplant and non-transplant patients by year-end are on track.
   - Near-term readouts expected from pivotal ABRAXANE combination trials and REVLIMID maintenance studies.

3. **Future Outlook**:
   - Further pipeline developments include Phase III initiations in early and later line low risk MDS, non-transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia, and advancement in multiple novel cancer therapies.
   - Collaboration with bluebird, Juno, and Agios promises potential breakthroughs in treating multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and relapsed refractory AML.

### Investment Outlook: 
Given the strong quarterly performance, continued market penetration, promising regulatory updates, and dynamic pipeline, the Hematology and Oncology franchise presents potential substantial growth opportunities. Considerations for new therapy approvals and major trial outcomes could substantially affect future performance, reinforcing the overweight stance for investors seeking exposure to innovative oncology treatments.

**Fiscal Guidance**:
Management confirms adherence to the optimistic fiscal guidance set for 2017, supported by overall robust franchise performance and upcoming strategic milestones anticipated in this fiscal year. Further close monitoring of the execution of regulatory approvals and market acceptance of new treatments will be crucial.
