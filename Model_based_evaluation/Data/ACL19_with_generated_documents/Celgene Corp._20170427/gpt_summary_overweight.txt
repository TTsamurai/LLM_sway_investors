Here is the summarized report on the recent earnings conference call:

The Hematology and Oncology franchise had a strong first quarter of 2017, with a 18% year over year sales growth and 1% sequential growth. REVLIMID had an excellent first quarter, with a 20% year over year net sales growth. POMALYST/IMNOVID also saw significant net sales growth of 33% year over year. ABRAXANE maintained stable demand, with a 5% year over year net sales growth.

The company has achieved critical regulatory and clinical milestones, including approval of REVLIMID as maintenance therapy post autologous stem cell transplantation. The international market for REVLIMID is growing, with strong volume and sales growth. The company is also advancing plans for submitting RVd in NDMM to the FDA by year end and has fully recruited the Phase III OPTIMISMM study of pomalidomide/bortezomib in second and later line multiple myeloma. The company's mid and late stage pipeline is making great progress, with plans to initiate pivotal programs for multiple additional assets by the end of this year.

The company is also preparing for the expected FDA approval of POMALYST in combination with daratumumab for relapsed refractory myeloma by June of this year. Additionally, the company is awaiting the Phase III results of indolent lymphoma programs and has exciting collaborations producing data for ASCO.

The company's confidence in obtaining approval for IDHIFA is high due to strong data, ongoing interactions with regulatory authorities, and clear definition of the patient population. Launch plans are in place and the company is excited about the potential commercial opportunity for IDHIFA, especially with the ongoing first line AML trials.

Overall, the company had a great start to the year and is on track to deliver its 2017 guidance, with strong sales growth and significant progress in its pipeline and regulatory milestones. As a financial analyst, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company based on this positive earnings call and the potential for continued growth and success in the future.
