's potential. Thank you.

Based on the recent earnings call, there are several positive factors to consider for the company. However, despite the strong sales performance and critical regulatory and clinical milestones achieved, there are still some cautionary elements to note. The decline in ABRAXANE net sales quarter over quarter and the impact of U.S. customer buying patterns suggest potential challenges in maintaining consistent growth. Additionally, the understanding that the initial opportunity for IDHIFA is limited and the need for the drug to show efficacy in first line AML in order to realize its full commercial potential is a cause for skepticism.

The fact that the company is awaiting the results of Phase III trials for their indolent lymphoma programs and the need for a confirmatory trial after the completion of a single-arm study for the JCAR017 drug in relapsed refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, indicates that there are still uncertainties surrounding the success of these pipeline assets. While there is excitement surrounding the potential FDA approval of POMALYST in combination with daratumumab, the impact on the company's overall growth is yet to be determined.

In conclusion, the company has shown promising performance and achieved significant milestones, but there are still uncertainties and challenges that warrant a cautious or skeptical perspective. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended for the company based on the recent earnings call.
