's potential approval and launch. 

From the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is clear that the Hematology and Oncology franchise had a strong first quarter of 2017. Key financial metrics include a 18% year over year sales growth and 1% sequential growth. REVLIMID net sales grew 20% year over year and 4% quarter over quarter, with strong growth in both the U.S. and international markets. POMALYST/IMNOVID net sales grew 33% year over year, with strong increases in treatment duration and total prescriptions. ABRAXANE net sales grew 5% year over year but declined by 11% quarter over quarter, primarily due to U.S. customer buying patterns.

However, despite these positive sales growth figures, it is important to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance based on several factors. Firstly, the decline in ABRAXANE sales quarter over quarter is a concern, as it suggests instability in this product's demand. Additionally, the impact of gross-to-net and coverage gap challenges on POMALYST/IMNOVID sales growth is a noteworthy negative factor. Finally, despite the strong sales performance, some inventory fluctuation and buying patterns have impacted the revenue growth of these products.

In conclusion, while the recent sales growth figures for the Hematology and Oncology franchise are strong, the underlying challenges and fluctuations in sales suggest a certain level of instability and unpredictability that warrant an 'underweight' investment stance. Further analysis of these financial metrics and larger market trends is necessary to fully assess the potential risks and rewards of investing in this franchise.
