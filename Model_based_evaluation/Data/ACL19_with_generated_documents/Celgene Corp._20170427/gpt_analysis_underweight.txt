's potential. Thank you for your question. So, for our pivotal study of luspatercept in beta-thalassemia and myelofibrosis, we have made significant progress in patient enrollment. We currently have trials ongoing for both indications and expect to have top-line results available by mid-2018. We are also planning to initiate a Phase II study in myelofibrosis later this year, further advancing our pipeline. In summary, we are on track to deliver our 2017 guidance and have achieved key regulatory and clinical milestones. Additionally, we are seeing positive growth in our international markets and are making progress in advancing our pivotal plans for multiple assets in our mid and late-stage pipeline. Thank you.
