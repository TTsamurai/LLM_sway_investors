. We are confident in the potential for strong sales growth and market share expansion for REVLIMID, POMALYST/IMNOVID, and ABRAXANE based on the recent performance and upcoming regulatory and clinical milestones. REVLIMID's strong sales growth and market expansion in the U.S. and internationally, as well as the upcoming sNDA submission for RVd in first line transplant and non-transplant patients, indicate a significant opportunity for continued growth. Additionally, the expected FDA approval of POMALYST in combination with daratumumab for relapsed refractory myeloma and the completion of enrollment for the Phase III OPTIMISMM trial for pomalidomide/bortezomib in second or later treatment line present strong near-term growth drivers for POMALYST/IMNOVID. The stable demand and ongoing global growth drivers for ABRAXANE, such as the expected results of the apact adjuvant pancreatic cancer trial and the pivotal combination trials in non-small cell lung cancer and triple negative breast cancer, further support the outlook for the company's oncology franchise.

Furthermore, the company's strong presence and anticipated data presentations at ASCO, as well as collaborations producing exciting data, suggest a robust pipeline and potential for continued growth and market expansion. The discussions on BB2121 at ASCO, the planning for pivotal study in Europe for JCAR017, and the positive volume growth and market share increases for REVLIMID and POMALYST/IMNOVID in the U.S. and Europe indicate a positive trend for the company's oncology franchise moving forward. Additionally, the potential approval of IDHIFA and ongoing Phase III luspatercept studies further support the company's future outlook.

In conclusion, based on the recent earnings conference call transcript and the key insights and financial metrics highlighted, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance for the company, as there are strong indications of continued growth, market expansion, and advancement in the company's oncology franchise.
