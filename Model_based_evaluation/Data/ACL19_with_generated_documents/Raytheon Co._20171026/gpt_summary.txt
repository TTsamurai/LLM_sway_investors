. To summarize the call, the company reported strong performance in the third quarter, with bookings, sales, EPS, and operating cash flow meeting or exceeding expectations. Bookings for the quarter were $7 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.11. Total backlog at the end of the third quarter was $36.7 billion, an increase of approximately $950 million compared to the end of the third quarter 2016. Sales were $6.3 billion in the quarter, up 4.5% with growth across all businesses. EPS from continuing operations was $1.97, better than expected, driven by strong margin performance. The company raised its full-year 2017 outlook for bookings and EPS, with updated sales growth range from 4% to 6% to 5% to 6%. The company's operating margin was 13.7% for the total company and 13% on a business segment basis. Operating cash flow for 2017 is expected to be between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion, with a cash flow profile more heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter due to the timing of program milestones and collections on larger contracts. The company also provided guidance for 2018, expecting a book-to-bill ratio above 1, strong sales growth of 3% to 5% over the midpoint of 2017, a slightly higher business segment margin, and an effective tax rate of approximately 31%. The company also plans to adopt a new retirement benefits standard in the first quarter of 2018, which will impact FAS/CAS adjustment. The company aims to return approximately 80% of free cash flow to shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Overall, the company reported another strong quarter and is well-positioned for continued growth in 2018.
