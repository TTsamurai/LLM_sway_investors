. In light of the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, the company has delivered strong performance in the third quarter, with bookings, sales, EPS, and operating cash flow meeting or exceeding expectations. The company's book-to-bill ratio of 1.11 in the third quarter and 1.08 on a trailing four-quarter basis indicate strong demand from global customers. Additionally, the total backlog at the end of the third quarter increased by approximately $950 million compared to the same period last year, pointing to a robust pipeline of future business.

Sales growth across all business segments, including IDS, Missile Systems, IIS, SAS, and Forcepoint, reflects the company's broad-based performance. Operating margins for the company and at the business segment level have demonstrated strength, with improvements in IDS driven by improved program performance and increases in net program efficiencies for Missile Systems. The company's EPS of $1.97 in the third quarter exceeded expectations, driven by strong margin performance.

By raising its full-year 2017 outlook for bookings and EPS, updating the sales growth range, and providing solid guidance for the fourth quarter, the company is demonstrating its strong foundation for continued growth in 2018.

Looking ahead to 2018, the company anticipates the book-to-bill ratio to be above 1, with strong sales growth of 3% to 5% over the midpoint of the 2017 outlook. Business segment margins are expected to increase slightly, and the effective tax rate is projected to be approximately 31%. The company remains committed to generating strong free cash flow and targeting the return of approximately 80% of free cash flow to shareholders, while maintaining a strong balance sheet.

Based on these insights and financial metrics, it is evident that the company is well-positioned for future growth, making it an attractive investment opportunity. Therefore, adopting an 'overweight' investment stance is justified based on the company's strong performance and outlook.
