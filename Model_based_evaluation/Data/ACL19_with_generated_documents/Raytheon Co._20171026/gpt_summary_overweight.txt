Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, the company has shown strong performance in the third quarter, with bookings, sales, EPS, and operating cash flow meeting or exceeding expectations. Key financial metrics include:

1. Bookings: The third quarter saw bookings of $7 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.11, and on a year-to-date basis, bookings were $19.2 billion.

2. Sales: Sales were $6.3 billion in the quarter, up 4.5% with growth across all business segments. International sales accounted for approximately 32% of total sales.

3. EPS: EPS from continuing operations was $1.97, better than expected, primarily driven by strong margin performance.

4. Operating Cash Flow: The company generated solid operating cash flow of $382 million in the third quarter, in line with prior expectations. The 2017 operating cash flow outlook is between $2.8 billion and $3.1 billion, more heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter due to the timing of program milestones and collections on larger contracts.

Based on the strong performance, the company raised its full-year 2017 outlook for bookings and EPS, updated the sales growth range to 5% to 6%, and provided guidance for 2018. The company anticipates the book-to-bill ratio in 2018 to be above 1 and expects strong sales growth for 2018 of 3% to 5% over the midpoint of the 2017 outlook. Additionally, the company aims to return approximately 80% of free cash flow to shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet.

Overall, the company is well-positioned for continued growth in 2018, and the financial analyst would adopt an 'overweight' investment stance based on the company's strong performance and optimistic outlook for future growth.
