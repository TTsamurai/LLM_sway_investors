Based on the information provided, the company has experienced strong performance in the third quarter, with bookings, sales, EPS, and operating cash flow exceeding expectations. However, from the financial metrics discussed, there are certain key points that lead to an 'underweight' investment stance. 

1. Bookings: Although the company experienced strong bookings in the third quarter and has raised its full-year 2017 outlook for bookings, the book-to-bill ratio, a key indicator of future growth, has slightly decreased from the previous year, which could signal potential challenges in sustaining growth.

2. Sales Growth: While there has been growth across all business segments, the margins at some segments, such as SAS and Forcepoint, were affected by changes in program mix and other performance, leading to a decrease in operating margin. Additionally, the sales growth range has been updated from 4% to 6% to 5% to 6%, which suggests a potential impact on future revenue growth.

3. Operating Cash Flow: The company's operating cash flow is expected to remain in line with 2017, with higher cash flow being generated by the businesses offsetting higher pension contributions and cash taxes. This could indicate challenges in maintaining strong cash flow growth in the future.

Taking these factors into account, adopting an 'underweight' investment stance would be prudent, as there are potential concerns around sustaining growth, improving margins, and managing cash flow effectively in the future. It is important to closely monitor the company's performance in the coming quarters to reassess the investment stance.
