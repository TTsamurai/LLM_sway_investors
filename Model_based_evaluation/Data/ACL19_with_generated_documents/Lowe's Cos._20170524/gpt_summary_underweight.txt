The company has experienced positive comps in 12 of 14 regions and 8 of 11 product categories, with a modest decline in transactions due to softer performance in outdoor categories. The company focused on a spring strategy intended to balance indoor and outdoor projects, but found that their messaging was too heavily weighted towards indoor categories. This was subsequently adjusted, leading to corresponding improvement in April.

The company achieved strong comps in appliances, kitchens, and flooring, leveraging their investments in customer experience, both in-store and online. They also drove above average comps in lumber and building materials, driven by strong Pro demand and continued recovery efforts from natural disasters. Pro activity also drove solid comps in rough plumbing and electrical and tools and hardware.

The gross margin contracted by 64 basis points, with 35 basis points of impact from product mix and RONA. The remainder of the decline was primarily the result of promotional activity, inflation in lumber, and pricing investments in key product categories. The company is working to refine their promotional strategy, improve productivity, and drive productivity in their supply chain.

The company has added new brands to appeal specifically to Pro customers, and has simplified their military discount program. They are looking forward to upcoming events such as Memorial Day, Father's Day, and July 4th, as well as their outdoor entertaining event.

They saw some opportunity to improve their DIY value perception and made adjustments to their marketing and pricing to drive increased traffic. The company also mentioned that they are facing many competitors in the marketplace and are working to optimize their media and improve their flexibility in responsiveness to market opportunities and weather.

They are keeping an eye on their credit card delinquency rates and overall customer satisfaction scores. They experienced pressure in their lawn, garden, and seasonal and outdoor living business, but have seen improvement as weather has stabilized. They have made pricing investments tied to seasonal products and special order products, and expect to partially offset the impact of those investments for the remainder of the year through cost improvements and refining their promotional strategy.

Overall, the company's performance in certain categories has been underwhelming, and their efforts to improve their messaging, pricing, and productivity are still ongoing. This, coupled with the pressure in their lawn, garden, and seasonal and outdoor living business, suggests that they may continue to face challenges in maintaining their current level of growth and performance. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended.
