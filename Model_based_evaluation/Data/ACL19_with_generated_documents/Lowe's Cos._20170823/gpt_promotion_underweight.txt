Based on the recent earnings call, there are several factors that suggest a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company. Despite the increase in sales and comp growth, there are several areas of concern. Firstly, the company's operating margin was impacted by several one-time gains and losses, which may not be sustainable in the long term. The company also experienced a decrease in gross margin due to promotional activity and increased expense pressures from the private label credit card program.

Additionally, the company is making significant investments in marketing, staffing, and customer-facing hours, which could impact profitability in the short term. The company also mentioned pressures from workers' compensation costs and competition in the marketplace, which could further impact earnings.

Furthermore, the company's guidance for the year includes a significant amount of share repurchases, indicating a potential lack of confidence in the company's future growth prospects.

Overall, these factors suggest that an 'underweight' investment stance may be warranted, as the company may face challenges in maintaining its current level of growth and profitability in the future.
