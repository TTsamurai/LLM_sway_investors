. Thank you for providing the transcript. Below is the summary of key financial metrics from the recent earnings conference call:

Earnings per share (EPS) for the third quarter, excluding certain items affecting comparability, were $1.58, showing a 2% decrease compared to the previous year.

Parks and Resorts segment showed an 18% increase in operating income, driven by growth in international operations, notably Shanghai Disney Resort and Disneyland Paris.

Domestic business experienced a 6% revenue growth driven by higher guest spending and attendance, but this was offset by increased expenses for supporting higher volume and new attractions.

Studio Entertainment operating income was lower due to lower theatrical and home entertainment results compared to the previous year.

Media Networks' Cable and Broadcasting businesses generated lower operating income primarily due to decrease at ESPN, as higher programming expense and lower advertising revenue offset growth in affiliate revenue.

Consumer Products and Interactive Media operating income was up 12% in the third quarter primarily due to an increase in merchandise licensing business.

The company repurchased 22.3 million shares for $2.4 billion in the third quarter and is on track to repurchase between $9 billion to $10 billion for the full year.

The management of the Parks segment is committed to driving improvement in margin and expects strong margins in the future.

The acquisitions of new offerings and investment spending for technology are expected to impact 2018 earnings, with more specific details to be provided later in the year.

Overall, while some segments experienced a decline in operating income, the company remains optimistic about future growth and is making investments for future success. The management also remains committed to increasing shareholder value through share repurchases.
