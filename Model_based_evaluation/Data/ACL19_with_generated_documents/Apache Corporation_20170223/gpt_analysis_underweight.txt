Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it appears that Apache has made significant strides in improving its financial standing and operational capabilities over the past two years, as a response to the collapse in commodity prices. The company has implemented strict capital discipline and cost structure rationalization, leading to improved quality and economics of its inventory. Significant cost reductions in operations and overhead structure have been achieved, resulting in preserved dividends, avoidance of equity issuance, and maintenance of an investment-grade rating.
 
Apache is now positioned to thrive in a more constructive, albeit lower-price environment than before the downturn. The company has a robust inventory capable of delivering organic growth for many years, with a focus on the Midland and Delaware Basins. The 2016 capital budget was $3.1 billion, a 60% increase from 2016, with the majority of investment allocated to the Permian Basin.
 
The 2017-2018 capital budget assumes a $50 per barrel WTI and includes increased capital allocation to the Midland and Delaware Basins, infrastructure construction at Alpine High, and investments in Egypt and the North Sea. The company anticipates significant and prolonged production growth ramp, with a projected 10% annual increase in total company production from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2018.
 
Apache's Alpine High play has shown significant progress, with an extensive play fairway and confirmed productivity in multiple targets. The company aims to optimize wells using customized zone targeting, larger fracs, and longer laterals to demonstrate the economic value of the play over the coming months. Midstream and marketing efforts at Alpine High are advancing quickly, with negotiations underway for natural gas and NGLs.

In conclusion, while Apache has demonstrated strong financial and operational improvements, the company's future outlook appears optimistic based on the outlined strategic and operational objectives. However, given the potential for commodity price volatility and the need for ongoing optimization and infrastructure development, an 'underweight' investment stance may be appropriate until there is more clarity on the company's ability to fully execute its growth plans and generate sustainable returns. A more cautious approach to investing may be prudent until further updates are provided on production growth, project execution, and the economic performance of the Alpine High play.
