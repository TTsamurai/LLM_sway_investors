Based on the recent earnings call, it is evident that Apache has made significant progress in repositioning the company in response to the collapse in commodity prices. The company has achieved financial improvements, cost reductions, and significant changes to its capital allocation process, improving the quality and economics of its inventory. The addition of Alpine High in the Delaware Basin has extended the company's inventory, providing grounds for robust organic growth.

The capital budget for 2017 has increased by over 60%, with almost two-thirds being allocated to the Permian Basin, specifically the Midland and Delaware Basins. Internationally, there are plans to invest in Egypt and the North Sea, with exploration projects in Suriname and the Western Desert of Egypt.

The company anticipates a significant and prolonged production growth ramp, with Midland and Delaware Basins expected to drive the majority of the production increase. The Alpine High play, specifically the wet gas interval, is expected to be very economic, with a minimum of 3,000 drillable locations.

The company's cash flow projections and capital budgeting have taken into account a positive view of future commodity prices, with measures in place to mitigate downside price movements. However, it is important to note that while the company remains optimistic, the production response may have a brief lag before transitioning to a strong growth trajectory.

The company has emphasized the need for continued cost efficiencies and well optimization, acknowledging the potential for efficiency improvements as they move into the optimization process. They have also stated that their goal is to deliver returns-focused growth through a conservative budget and maintaining flexibility to accelerate activity if required.

Overall, while Apache has presented a positive outlook for future growth, it is important to approach the investment stance cautiously given the volatility of commodity prices and the potential for production lags. The company's focus on capital allocation and future growth may still present some risks, leading to a recommendation for an 'underweight' investment stance at this time.
