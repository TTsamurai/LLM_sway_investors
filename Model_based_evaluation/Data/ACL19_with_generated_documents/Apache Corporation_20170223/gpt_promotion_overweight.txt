Based on the recent earnings call from the company, it is evident that there are several positive developments that investors should consider. 

Firstly, the company has made significant operational and financial improvements over the past two years, including reducing operational costs, reducing LOE per BOE, and reducing gross overhead cost structure. Despite the lower commodity price environment, the company has preserved its dividend and avoided issuing equity.

The company's capital budget for 2017 has increased by more than 60% from 2016, allocating nearly two-thirds of the budget to the Permian Basin, specifically the Midland and Delaware Basins. This increased investment is expected to drive a significant and prolonged production growth ramp, with a focus on delivering long-term returns-focused growth.

The company is confident in its production outlook, with a projected 10% annual increase in total company production from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2018. This growth will primarily be driven by the Midland and Delaware Basins, which are projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 50% over the same time period.

Furthermore, the company has made significant progress in delineating the Alpine High play, with confirmation of extensive play fairway, productivity in multiple geologic formations, and over-pressure in the entire play. This play is expected to be a significant economic driver for the company, with a minimum of 3,000 drillable locations and high potential for wet gas production.

The company's long-term focus on delivering fully burdened returns-focused growth, combined with its strategic capital allocation and cost optimization efforts, positions it well for future success. With a conservative capital budgeting approach and a focus on efficiency and well optimization, the company aims to deliver highly competitive returns and top-tier Permian-driven growth.

In conclusion, based on the information provided in the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The strategic and operational objectives outlined, combined with the positive developments in production and potential from the Alpine High play, make the company a compelling investment opportunity.
