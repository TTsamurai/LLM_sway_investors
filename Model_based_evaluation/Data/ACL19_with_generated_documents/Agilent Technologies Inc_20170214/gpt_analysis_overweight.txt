The company's adjusted EPS and adjusted operating margin show significant improvement over the previous year, indicating sustained profitability. 

Key drivers of the stronger-than-expected revenue growth include growth in the Pharma, Clinical and Diagnostics, and Food Testing business segments.

The return of growth in the chemical and energy markets is particularly encouraging, and the company is focused on sustaining this growth in the coming quarters. The new offerings in the gas chromatography and diagnostics segments are generating customer interest and are expected to contribute to future revenue growth.
