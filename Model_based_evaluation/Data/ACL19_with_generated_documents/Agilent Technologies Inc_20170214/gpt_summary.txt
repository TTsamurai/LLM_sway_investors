Overall, the company's growth prospects are encouraged, and they raise their full-year core revenue growth expectations. However, they are also cautious about challenges in some segments of the market and weak economic conditions in Europe and Japan. They anticipate continued weak global energy conditions as well. They are encouraged by their ability to outgrow the market, sustaining growth prospects, and new offerings making a difference in the marketplace. Their view is that the upside for the company hinges on the chemical energy segment and the return to growth being sustained. They will be monitoring this closely.
