. Good afternoon. Today, I would like to present a detailed summary report on Hologic's recent earnings conference call transcript, with a focus on key financial metrics and adopting an 'overweight' investment stance.

Hologic's fourth-quarter financial results for fiscal 2017 exceeded expectations, with revenue of $802.9 million, a 10.5% increase on reported basis and 9.9% in constant currency. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, revenue increased 5.0% or 4.4% in constant currency, showing solid mid single-digit growth.

The international sales drove most of the growth in the fourth quarter, with revenue of $189.9 million increasing 24.7%, and even excluding the impact of Cynosure and blood screening divestiture, international sales increased a robust 17.5%, reflecting significant progress in building sustainable growth internationally. This surpassed the previous expectations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the deliberate efforts made over the last 12 months.

In terms of divisional performance, Diagnostics posted sales of $273.7 million, an increase of 6.6%, driven by molecular diagnostics, which recorded a 13.8% increase. Breast Health sales totaled $300.9 million, an increase of 2.4%, with significant international growth. Surgical sales of $104.7 million increased 2.7%, although Skeletal reversed recent trends and posted very good results with a 12.9% increase in sales.

The Cynosure division sales were $81.4 million in the quarter, showing a significant decline but with positive progress towards building a stronger and better Cynosure 2.0. The company's efforts to revitalize the sales organization and launch new products are expected to drive growth in 2018 and beyond.

Overall, Hologic's financial performance in the fourth quarter reflects significant progress in building sustainable long-term growth, with a focus on international expansion, strengthening the business portfolio, and launching new products. The company's continued innovation in research and development, as well as the success in the molecular diagnostics business, showcase strong potential for future growth.

Based on these financial metrics and the company's strategic initiatives, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Hologic, indicating optimism for the company's future growth prospects. The progress made in international expansion, the potential for growth in the Cynosure division, and the sustained performance in other core business segments demonstrate the company's ability to deliver long-term value to investors. Thank you.
