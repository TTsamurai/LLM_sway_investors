 in the fourth quarter. It's clear that Hologic has made significant progress in building a sustainable growth company, particularly with an emphasis on international sales and the acquisition of Cynosure. The company's revenue in the fourth quarter grew 10.5% on a reported basis or 9.9% in constant currency, with international sales driving most of the growth at a robust 24.7%.

Furthermore, the Diagnostics division has emerged as a sustainable growth driver for the company, with molecular diagnostics posting strong sales and double-digit international growth. The Breast Health division also showed signs of improvement, with international sales growing at a strong 20.6% and the launch of new products expected to contribute to future growth.

Regarding Cynosure, while sales declined in the fourth quarter, the company has implemented a new leadership team and sales strategies to drive growth in the Medical Aesthetics division. It is clear that the company's focus is on building a sustainable growth engine through both organic and inorganic means.

Based on the insights and financial metrics from the recent earnings conference call, it is evident that Hologic is well-positioned for future growth. The company has demonstrated a strong performance in both its core divisions and is making strides in building a stronger Cynosure 2.0. Therefore, the 'overweight' investment stance is justified based on the company's recent financial results and future outlook.
