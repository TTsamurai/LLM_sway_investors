Based on the recent earnings call transcript from Clorox, there are several reasons to be cautious or skeptical about the company's performance. 

First, while the company reported 4% sales growth in the third quarter, the CEO mentioned that growth has been hard to achieve in the consumer environment. This implies that the company may be struggling to maintain strong growth in a challenging market.

Additionally, the CEO mentioned that the sales growth in the Home Care business unit was primarily driven by record third quarter shipments of Clorox disinfecting wipes behind club channel distribution, as well as from the new Clorox Scentiva line of disinfecting wipes and sprays. While these products are off to a strong start, it is still early, and there is no guarantee that this momentum will continue.

Furthermore, the CEO noted that the Laundry business saw a decrease in sales, largely due to continuing softness in the Clorox 2 color-safe laundry additive business. This indicates a weakness in a key product category for the company.

In the Household segment, the CEO mentioned that sales and volume were down for Charcoal, and while the company is supporting the 2017 grilling season with a new premium product, the initial ramp-up for the summer barbecuing season was slow. This suggests that the company may be facing challenges in driving sales in this segment.

The Lifestyle segment also saw a decrease in volume and sales, primarily driven by lower shipments in Water Filtration and Natural Personal Care, reflecting comparisons to double-digit volume growth in both businesses in the year-ago quarter. This indicates that the company may be struggling to maintain previous levels of growth in these areas.

In the Food business, the company made significant incremental investments in March that are anticipated to contribute meaningfully to fourth-quarter volume growth in support of new products. While these investments may pay off in the future, there is no guarantee of their success.

Overall, based on the information provided in the earnings call transcript, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on Clorox, as there are indications of potential challenges and uncertainties in the company's performance. It is important to carefully monitor future developments and assess the company's ability to overcome these challenges before considering a more optimistic investment stance.
