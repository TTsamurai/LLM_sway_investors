. Thank you. Moving on to our financial results, our third quarter was another solid one. We delivered 4% sales growth and a 10 basis point improvement in gross margin. On a reported basis, our gross margin rate was 46.5% and adjusted basis was 47.1%, an improvement of 60 basis points. And while we were again pleased with our margin progress, third quarter results reflect the mix impact of incremental distribution in clubs and our higher trade promotion spending, as I mentioned earlier on the call. Our total company EBIT margin was 17.4%, a 20 basis point improvement versus year-ago, and our year-to-date EBIT margin now stands at 19.6%. And so, as we do each quarter, I will provide more detail on our Q3 tax rate and ongoing share repurchase activities in our prepared remarks, and I'll also discuss our fiscal year view of these items. First, on taxes. In Q3, our effective tax rate was 16.6%, and we expect our full-year tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 25%. Our fiscal 2017 tax-rate range remains unchanged despite the decline in our Q3 tax rate and the expected impact of the early Q4 adoption of new stock-based compensation accounting in fiscal 2017. This adoption is expected to increase our full-year tax rate by approximately 100 basis points. Additionally, we continue to expect our cash tax rate to be in the range of 10% to 12% for fiscal 2017, reflecting the benefits from our ongoing optimization efforts in our supply chain and in our international structuring. Moving to share repurchases in the third quarter, our year-to-date share repurchases totaled $663 million, and during the quarter, we repurchased $249 million of stock. This included the final purchases under our fiscal 2015 original $750 million authorization and the first purchases under our new $2 billion authorization. As we mentioned in our Q2 earnings call in February, we expect to purchase the majority of shares under our new $2 billion authorization by the end of calendar 2017. Additionally, we also repurchased about $12 million in shares through our 401(k) plan, bringing our year-to-date total to $48 million. And finally, as we look to the rest of fiscal 2017, we still expect to repurchase a total of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion of our stock, driven by the remaining authorization under our $750 million program and the $2 billion program we started in February. For the full fiscal year, our year-to-date share repurchases total $663 million, and we expect to purchase the remaining amount by the end of calendar 2017. So it's worth noting, our commitment to returning cash to shareholders is still underpinned by our appreciation for the value of investment in shares at current prices. As we turn to our fiscal 2017 outlook, I'd like to remind you that Clorox expects earnings per diluted share from continuing operations to grow 4% to 7% on a GAAP basis and maintain its fiscal 2017 EPS from continuing operations range of $5.27 to $5.43, up 4% to 7%. And for the year, we continue to expect sales growth to be in the range of 3% to 4% and gross margin to be in the range of flat to up slightly. We are also maintaining our previous fiscal 2017 outlook for EBIT margin expansion, which we now expect to be in the range of 25 to 75 basis points. Finally, as you saw in our press release earlier today, we are also raising our fiscal 2017 outlook for free cash flow to represent 11.5% to 12.5% of sales, up from our previous range of 11% to 12% of sales. So in summary, based on our third quarter results and the updated outlook we've shared for fiscal 2017, we continue to execute well against not only our top line performance, but also in terms of our ability to manage our business to deliver strong financial results. And as we look ahead, we remain confident in our ongoing ability to drive top line growth and deliver margin, earnings, and cash flow expansion for the full year. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Benno for his perspective.  
With a 4% sales growth in the third quarter and a consistent track record of market share gains across our business units, Clorox continues to demonstrate strong performance in a challenging consumer environment. Our focus on innovation and investment in our brands is clearly paying off, as evidenced by the success of new products such as Clorox Scentiva and Clorox Fuzion, as well as the continued growth in our Home Care, Professional Products, Renew Life, and Cat Litter businesses. We remain optimistic about the future growth opportunities for Clorox, and we are confident in our ability to continue delivering strong financial results. Therefore, as a financial analyst, I recommend adopting an 'overweight' investment stance on Clorox based on its strong performance and growth prospects. Key financial metrics to consider include sales growth, market share gains, EBIT margin expansion, and free cash flow. With its consistent track record of delivering solid financial results and a positive outlook for the future, Clorox presents an attractive investment opportunity for investors looking for a company with strong fundamentals and growth potential.
