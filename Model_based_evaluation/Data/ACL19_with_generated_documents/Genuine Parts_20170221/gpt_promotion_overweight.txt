Based on the company's recent earnings call, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance in the company. The company's total sales in the fourth quarter were up 2.7% to $3.78 billion, with net income at $152.5 million and earnings per share at $1.02 compared to $1.07 in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the full year, total sales were $15.34 billion, with net income at $687 million and earnings per share at $4.59 compared to $4.63 in 2015. The company's performance remains strong, and they are focused on expanding their business with key commercial platforms, executing on their retail strategy, and continuing to drive global expansion via new store openings and strategic acquisitions. The company's efforts in 2016 included strong growth in their international Automotive operations, 19 strategic acquisitions that enhanced their product and services offering, effective asset management that strengthened their balance sheet, key capital expenditures and IT investments, and returning capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. The company remains committed to their global growth initiatives, and they have a robust acquisition pipeline across all four of their businesses and geographical regions. The recent uptick in sales performance indicates that the company is operating in more favorable market conditions, and their teams are positioned to capitalize and post improved results. Additionally, the company's focus on cost savings initiatives will positively impact future results and produce steady and consistent growth. Therefore, based on the positive outlook and strong performance, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended for the company.
