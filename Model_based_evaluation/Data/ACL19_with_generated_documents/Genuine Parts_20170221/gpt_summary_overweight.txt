The recent earnings conference call highlighted our strong financial performance in the fourth quarter and full year of 2016. Despite the challenging U.S. sales environment, our international operations in Canada, Mexico, and Australasia outperformed, leading to a 2.7% increase in total sales in the fourth quarter and a moderate increase for the full year. Additionally, we executed multiple initiatives that strengthened our global distribution network and enhanced our buying power for indirect and direct spend. Our strong balance sheet allowed us to further strengthen the company and generate cash flow, and we remain focused on our long-term growth targets.

Here are the key financial metrics for each of our business segments:
1. Automotive Operations: 
- Global Automotive sales were up 2.4% in the fourth quarter, with strong performance in the U.S. driven by commercial growth and DIY or retail sales growth.
- International Automotive operations in Australasia, Canada, and Mexico saw robust sales growth, with Canada showing steady sales and Mexico experiencing a double-digit increase in sales.
- The fundamental drivers for the U.S. Automotive aftermarket, such as the growing vehicle fleet and lower fuel prices, remain sound, indicating potential for increased sales in 2017.

2. Industrial Business (Motion Industries): 
- Industrial sales were up 4% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by improved sales to sectors like food processing, aggregate and cement, pulp and paper, and oil and gas.
- The energy sector is showing signs of recovery, with an increase in rig counts translating into improved sales.
- Exported goods also saw a positive trend, indicating potentially stronger sales for equipment and machinery customers in the OE sector.

3. Electrical Distribution Segment (EIS):
- EIS sales were flat in the fourth quarter but showed a sequential improvement from the previous quarters.
- The acquisition of CPS in October contributed accretively to the sales.
- We remain focused on driving meaningful sales growth at EIS over the long term.

4. Office Products: 
- The Office group reported a 4% increase in sales for the fourth quarter, driven by acquisitions in the facilities, breakroom, and safety supply category.
- Sales to independent reseller and mega account customers declined, offset by increased sales to e-tailers and the FBS distribution channel.
- FBS sales have expanded, diversifying the overall product and service offering.

Overall, we are confident in our global growth initiatives, including driving greater share of wallet with existing customers, disciplined acquisition strategy, digital capability expansion, and further store footprint expansion. We believe that our ongoing focus in these areas, coupled with initiatives to drive significant cost savings, will positively impact our future results and produce steady and consistent growth. Thank you.
