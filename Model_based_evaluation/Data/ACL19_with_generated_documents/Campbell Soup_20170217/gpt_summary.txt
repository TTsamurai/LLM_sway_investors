Summary:

In the recent earnings call, the company reported a 2% decline in organic sales in the second quarter, with the most prominent declines in the Campbell Fresh division. The Campbell Fresh division, which includes Bolthouse Farms beverages and salad dressings, Garden Fresh Gourmet, and fresh soups, faced challenges in sales performance. The company reported non-cash impairment charges related to the carrot and carrot ingredient and Garden Fresh Gourmet reporting units. However, there were bright spots in the quarter, such as growth in U.S. soup, simple meals, Pepperidge Farm snacks, and fresh soup. Adjusted gross margin increased, and the company expects to achieve its cost-savings target ahead of schedule. The company is optimistic about the potential of the packaged fresh category and remains committed to M&A in the fresh space. The Global Biscuits and Snacks division reported declining organic sales, mainly due to performance in China and competitive activity in the U.S. The Americas Simple Meals and Beverages division reported sales gains in soup and simple meals but faced challenges in the V8 shelf-stable beverages. The company remains focused on driving continued growth and increasing innovation in its product lines. The company's Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro, highlighted the strong performance of Pepperidge Farm and the success of the DSD distribution system. The company also discussed its plans to invest in marketing and brand building while navigating through the cost-savings initiative. Despite the challenges faced, the company remains committed to its long-term strategic vision of building a fresh food platform.
