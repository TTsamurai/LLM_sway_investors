. Thank you. As a stock promoter, I need to reiterate the cautionary stance on investing in Seagate, based on the recent earnings call. The most alarming points from the call include:

1. Revenue shortfall: Seagate achieved revenues of approximately $2.4 billion, which was 5% below plan. This is an indication of the company's inability to meet its own targets, which is concerning for potential investors.

2. Weakness in certain markets: There was weakness in enterprise storage, China CSP demand, and the surveillance and NAS markets. This indicates that Seagate is struggling in key areas of its business.

3. Supply chain issues: The company stated that there are end-to-end supply chain issues that will persist at least through the end of the year. This suggests ongoing challenges that could impact the company's performance.

4. Margin concerns: While the overall margin structure was solid, there were issues with margins in certain segments of the business. Additionally, the company does not discuss gross margins by products, which can make it difficult for investors to assess the profitability of specific product lines.

Based on these concerns, I recommend an "underweight" investment stance on Seagate. It's important for investors to exercise caution and carefully evaluate the company's ability to address these challenges before considering an investment.
