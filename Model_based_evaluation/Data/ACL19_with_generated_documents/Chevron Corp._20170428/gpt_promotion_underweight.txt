. Thank you. 

Based on the recent earnings call, there are several factors to consider when evaluating an investment in Chevron:

1. First quarter 2017 earnings were $2.7 billion or $1.41 per diluted share, excluding foreign exchange and special items, earnings totaled $2.3 billion or $1.23 per share. Cash from operations for the quarter was $3.9 billion, including about $1 billion in working capital consumption. Reductions in capital spend and improved realizations contributed to the positive cash flow, but working capital requirements consumed approximately $1 billion in the quarter. This historical pattern of working capital consumption in the first half of the year and reversal in the second half is likely to hold in 2017, impacting cash flow.

2. The company aims to be cash balanced in 2017 at $50 Brent prices, with net cash generation of $900 million in the first quarter, incorporating impacts of growing operating cash flow, reduced capital spend, and proceeds from asset sales.

3. However, asset sale proceeds were $2.1 billion, primarily from the sale of geothermal assets in Indonesia. The company has also signed sales and purchase agreements to sell marketing and refining assets in Canada and downstream business in South Africa and Botswana, as well as an agreement to sell upstream assets in Bangladesh. These assets sales will impact production, and transaction timing will impact production growth.

4. Upstream updates indicate lowering cost structures and reduced spending, with significant progress on lowering the cost structure and plans to lower annual capital expenditures to between $17 billion to $22 billion through 2020, with future spend likely near the bottom of this range if oil prices remain near $50 per barrel.

5. The company is focused on improving returns as projects are completed and revenue is realized from growing production volume, aided by ongoing reductions in operating expenses and improvements in managing major capital projects.

6. The company is evaluating options in response to an Australian court ruling that affected the appropriate interest rate for a loan between Chevron's corporate group and its Australian subsidiary, potentially impacting future investment in Australia.

7. The company is also evaluating a range of economic factors, including the pace of spending on major capital projects, oil prices, internal cash generation, and uncertainties in production growth for 2017.

Based on these factors, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on Chevron. The company's production growth and cash flow may be impacted by working capital consumption, asset sales, and uncertainties in production growth, along with potential implications of the Australian court ruling. These factors present caution and skepticism for potential investors.
