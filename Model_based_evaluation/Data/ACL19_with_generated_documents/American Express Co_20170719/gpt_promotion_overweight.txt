Based on the recent earnings call, it is evident that the company has shown solid progress and steady growth in revenue and earnings. The company's focus on accelerating revenue growth, optimizing investments and resetting the cost base has resulted in an increase in adjusted revenue growth of 8% for the second quarter. Additionally, the company has returned significant amounts of capital to shareholders through its dividend and share buyback programs, demonstrating its commitment to creating shareholder value.

The company's diverse range of growth businesses, steady operating leverage, and strong balance sheet contribute to steady EPS growth. With a solid second quarter performance and momentum in billing and loan growth, the company is well-positioned to continue competing effectively in a challenging environment. It has also made clear progress in driving growth opportunities across diverse segments and geographies.

The company has also demonstrated its ability to efficiently manage expenses, with adjusted operating expenses declining by 4%, reflecting progress on cost reduction initiatives. The effective tax rate has also decreased, and the company now expects the full year tax rate to come in slightly below the previously stated range.

Overall, the company's performance in the first half of the year has exceeded expectations, and it expects full year adjusted revenue growth to be above the top end of the 5% to 6% range discussed in the Investor Day in March. With a confident outlook for the back half of 2017, the company anticipates delivering full year earnings per share between $5.60 and $5.80.

Based on these compelling results and the company's strong performance, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. This is due to its solid progress against its priorities, consistent revenue and earnings growth, efficient cost management, and commitment to delivering shareholder value through capital returns. The company's ability to adapt in a challenging environment and drive sustainable growth makes it an attractive investment opportunity for investors.
