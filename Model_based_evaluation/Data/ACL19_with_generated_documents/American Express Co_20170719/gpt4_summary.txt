## Earnings Conference Call Summary - Q2

### Financial Performance Overview:
- **Revenue:**
  - Q2 Revenue was $8.3 billion, showing a modest year-over-year increase of 1%. This increase was primarily driven by higher net interest income. 
  - Adjusted for impacts from Costco and foreign exchange, the revenue growth was 8%.

- **Net Income:**
  - For Q2, net income stood at $1.3 billion, marking a 33% decrease compared to Q2 of 2016. The prior year's comparison is notably high due to a $1.1 billion gain recorded from the sale of the Costco cobrand portfolio.

- **Earnings Per Share (EPS):**
  - Reported EPS for Q2 was $1.47, reflecting the above-mentioned factors along with the benefits derived from a strong capital position.
  - During the past four quarters, the company returned $3.2 billion to shareholders and reduced average shares by 5%, contributing to EPS.

- **Return on Equity (ROE):**
  - The trailing twelve-month ROE as of June stood at 22%, below the usual performance of around 25%. This deviation is attributed to quarterly earnings variability in 2016.

- **Loan Portfolio:**
  - Total loans saw an 11% increase from the previous year, underscoring solid performance and industry-leading growth in lending.
