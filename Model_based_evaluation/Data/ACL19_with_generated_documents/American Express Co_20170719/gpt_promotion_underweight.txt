Based on the company's recent earnings call transcript, there are several factors that suggest a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company. Here are some key points to consider:

1. Revenue Growth: The company reported an 8% growth in adjusted revenue for Q2, which exceeded the 5-6% range previously discussed. However, the CEO also mentioned that certain drivers of revenue growth, such as increased customer engagement and growth in yield, may stabilize in future quarters, indicating a potential slowdown in revenue growth.

2. Operating Expenses: While the company has made progress in cost reduction initiatives and expects to remove $1 billion from its cost base by the end of 2017, the adjusted operating expenses were still up by 39% compared to the prior year (excluding one-time gains and restructuring charges). This indicates that the company's efficiency and cost reduction efforts may not be fully effective in controlling expenses.

3. Rewards Expense: The company's rewards expense increased by 20% when adjusted for certain factors, while proprietary billings only grew by 6%. This suggests that the cost of rewards is outpacing the growth in billings, which could impact profitability.

4. Uncertainty in Regulatory Environment: The CEO mentioned that the regulatory environment in markets like Europe, Australia, and China will continue to evolve, and the company will need to adapt its business model accordingly. This indicates potential challenges and uncertainties in international markets, which could affect the company's performance.

5. Uneven Year-Over-Year Comparisons: The CEO highlighted that the second half of 2017 will provide a clearer picture of the company's progress, as certain one-time events and partnerships from previous years will no longer impact year-over-year comparisons. This suggests that the company's performance may have been influenced by non-recurring factors in the past, and future results may not be as strong.

Based on these factors, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company, as there are potential concerns about revenue growth sustainability, cost control effectiveness, and uncertainties in international markets. Investors should approach the company with caution and carefully evaluate its future performance before making any significant investment decisions.
