## Summary Report on Earnings Conference Call – Q2 2023

### Key Financial Metrics Overview:
**Earnings Per Share (EPS):** $1.47, reflecting a mixture of solid capital position and reduced average shares due to share repurchases. This marks a strong performance despite the backdrop of the prior year's significant gains from the Costco co-brand portfolio sale.

**Revenue Growth:** Adjusted revenue growth stood at 8%, driven primarily by a higher year-over-year net interest income. Notably, this excludes impacts from the Costco-related revenues from the prior year and FX adjustments.

**Net Income:** Reported at $1.3 billion, experiencing a 33% decrease from the prior year, predominantly due to the extraordinary gain from the previous year’s sale of the Costco portfolio.

**Return on Equity (ROE):** Currently at 22%, down from a past performance level of approximately 25%. This decline is majorly attributed to the prior year's uneven quarterly earnings, with expectations to realign with previous performance levels as the year progresses.

### Investment Stance: Underweight
Given the analysis of the financial metrics and upcoming business outlook, the recommendation is to adopt an underweight investment stance for the following reasons:

1. **Regulatory and Competitive Challenges:** The company notes significant regulatory challenges in key markets such as Europe, Australia, and China, along with intense competition in the U.S. These factors are anticipated to influence business operations and could potentially hamper growth.

2. **Revenue Growth Dependency:** The company largely benefits from specific revenue drivers such as increased cardmember engagement and higher net interest yields, which are subject to stabilization and might not produce similar growth levels in future quarters.

3. **Cost Management and Expense Growth:** Despite positive remarks on cost management, the substantial 26% increase in provision, compared to an 11% loan growth, and increased operational expenses suggest potential inefficiencies or underlying challenges in managing cost relative to growth aggressively.

4. **Market and Macroeconomic Conditions:** The uncertain macroeconomic environment, including impacts from global regulatory changes and market competition, could pose risks to sustained growth and profitability.

5. **Capital Return Strategy:** The company's strategy of returning significant capital to shareholders, while maintaining a robust capital strength, indicates a potential prioritization of shareholder returns over reinvestment into competitive or innovative business areas.

### Forward-Looking Statements:
The forecasted EPS for the full year 2023 is set between $5.60 and $5.80. Revenue growth expectations have been adjusted to above the previously stated 5%-6% range, signaling management's confidence in current business strategies despite potential challenges ahead.

### Conclusion:
While the company displays solid financial fundamentals in certain areas, the broader context of competitive pressures, regulatory impacts, and reliance on certain key revenue drivers warrant a careful underweight positioning at this juncture, with a close monitor on strategic implementation and market conditions. Further adjustments in investment stance may be necessary as new data becomes available in subsequent quarters.
