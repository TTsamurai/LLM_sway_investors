   - **Operating Income Growth**: 13%
   - **Segment Operating Margin**: Improved by 150 basis points to 24.4%, highest since 2004 despite disruptions.

   - **Broadcasting**: Improved due to higher affiliation revenue and lower programming costs, stable ad revenue year-over-year.
   - **Affiliate Revenue Growth**: 4%, impacted positively by rate growth but negatively by lower subscriptions and foreign exchange.
   
3. **Consumer Products and Interactive Media**:
   - **Operating Income**: Declined significantly due to lower merchandise sales and weaker performance in the games business.
   - **Future Outlook**: Projected growth in H2 with contributions expected from Cars and Spider-Man merchandise.
   
4. **Studio Entertainment**:
   - **Operating Income**: $842 million, the second-best Q1 performance, despite declines in home entertainment and theatrical businesses; strong performance offset by difficult comparisons to the previous year.
   
#### Other Financial Highlights:

- **Cash Operations**: Affected by a $1.3 billion pension contribution; without this, the operations show positive momentum.

#### Future Considerations:

- **Q2 Outlook**:
