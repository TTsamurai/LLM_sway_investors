### Detailed Financial Performance:

**1. Phosphates Segment:**

- **Performance**: Near top guidance for shipment volumes and prices. Gross margin was 8%, consistent with updated guidance.
- **Challenges**: Mechanical issues and a sinkhole incident escalated costs, but these are addressed and not expected to impact future quarters significantly.
- **Outlook**: Q3 shipment volumes expected between 2.2 million to 2.5 million tonnes; prices between $310 to $330 per tonne. Yearly volume guidance adjusted to 9.5 to 10 million tonnes. Margin recovery anticipated as temporary pricing pressures ease.

**2. Potash Segment:**

- **Performance**: Sales volumes and prices met mid-guidance; margin rates exceeded expectations due to strong cost control measures.
- **Outlook**: Anticipated sales of 1.9 to 2.2 million tonnes for Q3 at prices of $165 to $180 per tonne. Gross margin rate projected at 15% to 18%. Full-year volume guidance narrowed to 8.1 million to 8.6 million tonnes.

**3. International Distribution Segment:**

- **Performance**: Volumes met guidance; margins exceeded expectations due to premium product mix and price appreciation.
- **Outlook**: Expected Q3 volumes of 2.3 to 2.6 million tonnes; margins in the low $20 per tonne range. Full-year volume guidance now stands at 6.75 million to 7.25 million tonnes.

**4. Corporate Segment:**

- **Insight**: Recorded a loss due to profit in inventory eliminations, which is expected to reverse in Q3 benefiting the consolidated gross margins.
- **Tax Guidance**: Effective annual tax rate expected to be zero to slightly negative, enhancing net profitability.

**5. Strategic Acquisitions and Investments:**

- **Ma'aden Wa'ad Al-Shamal Joint Venture**: Recorded $12 million in equity earnings, with production scaling up, which should contribute positively to future earnings.

**6. Financial Health and Credit Considerations:**

- **Liquidity**: Strong with $700 million cash on hand and a $2 billion revolver.
- **Credit Rating**: Intent to maintain solid investment-grade status despite potential downgrades due to cyclical nature of the industry.
