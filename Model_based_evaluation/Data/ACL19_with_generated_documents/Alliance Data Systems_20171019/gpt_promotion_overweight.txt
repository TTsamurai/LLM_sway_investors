Based on the recent earnings call for the company, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' stance on the investment in the company. Despite a decrease in revenue for the third quarter, there were positive growth indicators in various segments of the company. The core EPS increased by 13% and adjusted EBITDA also showed growth, particularly in the Card Services segment. The reduction in corporate debt and leverage ratio provides a strong financial position for the company, with over $2 billion in available liquidity.

Looking at the LoyaltyOne segment, although there was a decrease in revenue, the future outlook for this segment is optimistic. The company expects improvement in the fourth quarter and 2018. Additionally, signing a multi-year contract with the largest sponsor, BMO, is a positive development.

In the Epsilon segment, revenue increased and the technology platform offering showed progress towards a promising turnaround. The onboarding of new clients is expected to fill the revenue gap quickly.

The Card Services segment continues to show solid growth, with revenue and adjusted EBITDA net showing an increase. Despite the negative impact from hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the company's gross loss rates were down year-over-year, indicating the strength of the core operations.

Overall, the company's performance in various segments and its strong financial position indicate a promising outlook for future growth. With positive trends expected in the upcoming quarters, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended.
