Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that the company is facing headwinds in its LoyaltyOne and Epsilon segments while Card Services is performing relatively well. Revenue for the third quarter increased only 1% to $1.9 billion, lower than mid-single digit expectations, primarily due to the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma on the growth shields at Card Services. LoyaltyOne saw a 20% decrease in revenue and Epsilon came in short of expectations with a 3% increase in revenue and a 7% decrease in adjusted EBITDA.

Despite the challenges faced in LoyaltyOne and Epsilon, Card Services had a solid quarter with a 9% increase in revenue and a 20% increase in adjusted EBITDA. Average card receivables increased 14%, and credit sales increased 5%, while operating expenses increased 16%. The net loss rate improved to 5.5% for the third quarter 2017, better than expectations. However, the hurricanes had a temporary impact, reducing credit sales and revenue by about $40 million for the quarter and negatively impacting the gross yield.

Considering the challenges faced in LoyaltyOne and Epsilon, and the temporary impact of the hurricanes on Card Services, it is prudent to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. The future outlook for LoyaltyOne remains uncertain, with the company expecting improvements in the fourth quarter, and an increase in revenue and adjusted EBITDA for BrandLoyalty. Epsilon's growth rate in digital offerings slowed during the quarter, but the onboarding of new clients is expected to fill this gap quickly. However, the company expects a promising turnaround in Epsilon's technology platform offering.

In conclusion, the company's performance in the third quarter was mixed, with strong performance in Card Services, while facing challenges in LoyaltyOne and Epsilon. The impact of the hurricanes on Card Services is temporary, but the uncertain future outlook for LoyaltyOne and the challenges faced in Epsilon warrant an 'underweight' investment stance for the company.
