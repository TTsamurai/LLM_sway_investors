Based on the information provided, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for the company. Here are the key financial metrics from the earnings conference call transcript that support this recommendation:

1. Revenue for the third quarter increased by 1% to $1.9 billion, despite the impact of hurricanes Harvey and Irma on the growth shields at Card Services.
2. Core EPS increased by 13% to $5.35 for the third quarter 2017, primarily driven by lower loss rates of Card Services and a lower tax rate.
3. Adjusted EBITDA net increased by 7%, benefiting from the better-than-expected loss rate at Card Services and the reduction of corporate debt by approximately $180 million.
4. LoyaltyOne's future outlook appears promising, with a decrease in revenue and adjusted EBITDA during the third quarter, but expectations for improvement in the upcoming quarters. The re-signing of the largest sponsor, BMO, to a multi-year contract is a positive development.
5. Epsilon experienced a shortfall compared to expectations for the third quarter, with a 3% increase in revenue and a 7% decrease in adjusted EBITDA. However, the onboarding of new clients is expected to fill this gap quickly.
6. Card Services produced solid quarter growth, with a 9% increase in revenue and a 20% increase in adjusted EBITDA net. The impact of hurricanes on credit sales and revenue was estimated, and it is expected that operations will return to normal in the fourth quarter.

The overall financial performance of the company, despite temporary setbacks such as the impact of the hurricanes, demonstrates strong growth potential in the long term. Therefore, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended as the company shows stability and potential for growth in various segments.
