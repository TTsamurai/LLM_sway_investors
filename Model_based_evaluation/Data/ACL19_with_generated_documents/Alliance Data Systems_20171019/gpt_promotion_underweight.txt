Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. Revenue for the third quarter fell short of expectations due to hurricanes Harvey and Irma negatively impacting the growth shields at Card Services. LoyaltyOne also experienced a tough quarter, with revenue and adjusted EBITDA decreasing. While future prospects for this segment look promising, there is still uncertainty in the short-term. Epsilon also fell short of expectations in the third quarter, with revenue increasing 3% and adjusted EBITDA decreasing 7%. The pullback in digital growth negatively impacted EBITDA margins. While there is progress being made, there is still uncertainty in the short-term. The company's Card Services segment produced solid growth, but the hurricanes had a temporary impact on credit sales and revenue. The impact of the hurricanes also influenced the company's gross loss rates. Additionally, there may be some timing differentials affecting new programs, impacting revenue in the short-term. While the company is expecting a bounce back in the fourth quarter, there is still uncertainty regarding the timing of new programs. Overall, the company's performance in the third quarter and the potential for future impact from external factors warrants a cautious investment stance. It is recommended to closely monitor the company's performance in the coming quarters before making any significant investment decisions.
