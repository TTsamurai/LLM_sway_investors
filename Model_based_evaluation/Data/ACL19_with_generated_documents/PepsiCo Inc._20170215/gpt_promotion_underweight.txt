Based on the company's recent earnings call, there are several factors that warrant a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company. 

First, the company's performance in 2016 was heavily reliant on strong North American beverage and snack segments, but the company also reported challenging macro volatility and weak currencies in international markets which impacted reported results. Additionally, the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela had a drag on earnings, suggesting potential risk in international operations.

Investments in advertising and marketing as well as R&D have increased significantly, which raises questions about the sustainability of the company's financial returns in the long-term. The company's reliance on a robust innovation agenda may also pose risks if consumer preferences or market trends shift, impacting the success of new product launches.

Furthermore, the company's commitment to ongoing investments in capability and infrastructure raises concerns about the company's ability to balance short-term financial performance with long-term shareholder value creation. 

Finally, the company's acknowledgment of a volatile and uncertain macro environment suggests potential challenges in delivering attractive results in the short-term. 

Based on these factors, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company until there is further clarity on the company's ability to navigate these potential risks and uncertainties.
