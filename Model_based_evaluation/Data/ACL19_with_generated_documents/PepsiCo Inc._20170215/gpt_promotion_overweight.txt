Based on the recent earnings call, I am recommending an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company has achieved or exceeded each of their financial goals for the year, including organic revenue growth, expansion of core operating margins, and core constant currency EPS growth. They have also generated substantial free cash flow, expanded their core net return on invested capital, and met their goal of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Additionally, they have had good operating performance across their operating segments, with strong results in their North American divisions and solid organic revenue growth in international markets. 

The company's commitment to top-line growth and productivity is evident in their substantial investments in advertising and marketing, research and development, and infrastructure. They have also made disciplined investments in local communities and their employees, indicating a strong commitment to long-term sustainability and success.

Looking ahead to 2017, the company is confident in their ability to continue to perform well, despite expectations of a volatile and uncertain macro environment. They have a strong focus on managing everything within their control, including investments in areas that drive top-line growth and maintaining a judicious balance between share growth and profitability.

Overall, the company's solid momentum, strong financial performance, and strategic investments position them for continued success in the future. Therefore, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company based on their recent earnings call.
