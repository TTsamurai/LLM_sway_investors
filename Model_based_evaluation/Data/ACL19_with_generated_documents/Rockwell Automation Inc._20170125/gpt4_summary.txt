1. **Architecture & Software (A&S)**
   - Sales: $696 million, up 8.3% year-over-year.
   - Operating Margin: Reached 30%, a substantial increase by 2.6 points, largely due to operational leverages and reduced spending.

   - Sales: $794 million, a marginal increase of 1.3% from the previous year.
   - Operating Margin: Reduced to 13.6%, down 1.7 points, primarily attributed to higher incentive compensation costs.

**Guidance Revision:**
- **Organic Growth**: Revised expectation sets a new range of 1% to 5% for the year, a shift from 2% (previous midpoint) due to better-than-expected Q1 performance.
- **Sales Forecast**: Total expected sales are projected slightly over $6 billion, acknowledging a significant currency headwind.
- **Margin Outlook**: Previous guidance was around 20%, now slightly increased.
- **Adjusted Full-Year EPS**: Revised range is $5.95 to $6.35, from previous $5.85 to $6.25.
- **Tax Rate**: Adjusted to approximate closer to 23.5% accounting for Q1 discrete tax benefits.
- **Share Repurchases**: Continued commitment to buyback with $400 million expected expenditure this year.
  
**Additional Considerations:**
- A detailed note was made regarding the corporate environment shift due to tax reform and repatriation of overseas earnings projected at around $2 billion subject to favorable conditions. This offers potential for increased corporate investments or shareholder returns.

**Conclusion:**
The company's financial health is positive with robust sales growth, enhanced margins, and solid cash generation capabilities. Challenges include currency fluctuations and changes in spending patterns which the company is monitoring closely. Future outlook remains optimistic with adjustments made to full-year guidance reflecting a better-than-initially-expected performance in Q1 and strategic optimism reflected in the revised targets and tax benefits.
