Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, the company's sales increased by 4.5% in the first quarter compared to last year, with organic sales increasing by 3.8%. Segment operating margin was 21.2%, primarily due to higher sales and lower spending. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 17% compared to the first quarter of last year, due to higher sales, improved margins, and a lower tax rate. Free cash flow for Q1 was $271 million, and the trailing four-quarter return on invested capital was 34.6%. The company also provided an increase in expectations for organic growth for the full year, now expecting a midpoint of 3%.

However, it is important to note that the Control Products & Solutions segment saw a slight increase in sales compared to last year, but also experienced a decrease in operating margin due to higher incentive compensation costs. The company outlined revisions to adjusted EPS guidance, with the new range of $5.95 to $6.35, and discussed plans for share repurchases, general corporate net expense, and adjusted effective tax rate.

While the company's performance in Q1 was better than expected, an 'underweight' investment stance may be advisable due to potential headwinds from currency translations, higher spending, and potential challenges in heavy industry. It is important to closely monitor the company's progress in the next quarter and any potential impacts from changes in tax legislation or global economic conditions.
