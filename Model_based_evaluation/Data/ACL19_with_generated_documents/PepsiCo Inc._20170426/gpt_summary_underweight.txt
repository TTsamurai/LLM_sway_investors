. After analyzing the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is clear that PepsiCo is making efforts to transform their business to meet evolving consumer preferences. The company's performance in the first quarter of 2017 was in line with expectations, with positive volume growth in both global snacks and global beverages, and organic revenue growth driven by developing and emerging markets. Key financial metrics such as organic revenue growth of at least 3% and core constant currency EPS growth of 8% for the full year 2017 outlook were reiterated.

There is a focus on offering healthier and more nutritious products, with investments in R&D and manufacturing technologies to transform the product portfolio. The company is also delivering top-tier growth for retailers and foodservice partners, as well as contributing to a healthier planet while boosting their bottom line through environmental sustainability initiatives.

PepsiCo is also committed to fostering a healthy workplace and culture for its associates, as well as promoting healthier communities wherever it operates. The company's performance with Purpose approach guides every aspect of its business, with a focus on building a healthier future for all stakeholders.

However, despite these positive developments, there are concerns regarding the timing of the New Year holiday, the delay of U.S. income tax refunds, and weak currencies in overseas markets that impacted reported results. Additionally, the Quaker hot cereals business in North America has been flat to slightly down, reflecting challenges in the center store category in grocery stores.

Considering these factors, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for PepsiCo, as the company may continue to face headwinds in the near future. While there are positive initiatives in place, the challenges in certain business segments and external market conditions may impact the company's financial performance. Therefore, a cautious approach to investment in PepsiCo is advisable at this time.
