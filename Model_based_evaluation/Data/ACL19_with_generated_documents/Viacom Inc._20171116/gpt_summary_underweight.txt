This transcript from the earnings conference call for Viacom shows some positive financial indicators, such as increased revenue and operating free cash flow. However, there are several key financial metrics that are cause for concern, leading to an 'underweight' investment stance.

One concern is the decline in affiliate revenues for Media Networks, which decreased by 1% for the full year and 3% for the quarter. This decline was due to lower revenues from SVOD and OTT agreements, as well as a decrease in subscribers. The company also experienced a 12% decline in domestic ancillary revenue, mainly due to lower consumer products revenues.

Another concern is the decline in Theatrical revenues for Filmed Entertainment, which decreased by 43% to $115 million in the quarter. This decline was driven by lower revenue from current quarter releases.

Additionally, Viacom recorded a net $59 million negative impact on operating income related to the write-off of amounts previously reported. This negative impact led to adjusted earnings per share of $0.77 for the quarter, which would have been $0.88 without the impact.

Furthermore, the company's guidance for fiscal 2018 anticipates pressure on domestic affiliate revenues, driven by rate resets, lower SVOD revenues, and subscriber declines. This guidance expects high single-digit declines in Q1 and Q2, with these declines improving in the second half, resulting in a mid-single-digit decline for fiscal 2018.

Overall, these key financial metrics indicate potential challenges for Viacom, leading to an 'underweight' investment stance. It is important for investors to carefully consider these metrics before making any investment decisions.
