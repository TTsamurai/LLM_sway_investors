In my cautious and skeptical perspective on Viacom based on their recent earnings call, there are several key concerns to consider. One major issue is the decline in domestic affiliate revenues, which is expected to continue in the first half of fiscal 2018 due to rate resets, lower SVOD revenues, and subscriber declines. Although the company anticipates a mid single-digit decline for fiscal 2018, it may be concerning for investors as it could impact overall revenue growth.

Additionally, there is a significant decline in theatrical revenues for Filmed Entertainment, which decreased 43% in the quarter. This decline is largely due to lower revenue from current quarter releases, and it may indicate challenges in the studio's ability to attract audiences to its films.

Furthermore, the decision to end the slate financing deal with HuaHua and pursue alternative financing arrangements resulted in a net $59 million negative impact on operating income in the quarter. This financial impact could raise questions about the company's strategic decision-making and its potential impact on future earnings.

Overall, based on the information provided in the earnings call, it seems that Viacom may face challenges in sustaining revenue growth and profitability in the near term. Therefore, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company until there are clearer signs of improvement in key financial metrics.
