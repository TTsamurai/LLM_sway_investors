#### Segment Performance:
  
- **Media Networks:**
  - Q4 revenues in this segment increased by 3% to $2.6 billion. The growth was propelled by a 6% rise in worldwide advertising revenues and a 5% increase in ancillary revenues, though affiliate revenues saw a slight decrease of 1%.
  - International revenues were particularly robust, growing by 24% to $593 million in Q4, driven by the Telefe acquisition and strong organic growth in advertising and affiliate revenues.

- **Filmed Entertainment:**
  - This segment reported a revenue increase of 2% in Q4. Notably, license fees surged by 30% to $423 million thanks to higher revenues from Paramount Television.
  - The segment managed to reduce its adjusted operating loss to $43 million in Q4 from a loss of $137 million the previous year, benefiting from higher revenues and decreased operating expenses.

#### Strategic Developments:
  
- **Financing Strategy:** Viacom ended its slate financing deal and introduced a more flexible model aligning with its new film production strategy. This shift is expected to capture greater upside on modestly budgeted films without third-party financing.

- **Debt Management:** Viacom has reduced its gross debt by approximately $2 billion or 15%, demonstrating firm commitment to maintaining robust investment-grade metrics.

#### Forward-Looking Statements:

- **Media Networks:** For FY 2018, early challenges related to distributor negotiations are expected, particularly impacting domestic affiliate revenues. However, improvements are anticipated in the latter part of the year with the potential for operational cost savings of about $100 million.

- **Filmed Entertainment:** Under new management, the segment is expected to see significant operational improvements and revenue growth driven by streamlined production and marketing efforts.

#### Overweight Investment Stance Rationale:
Given Viacom's strategic initiatives including debt reduction, improvements in operating free cash flow, stable adjusted operating income, and promising developments in domestic and international segments, we maintain an 'overweight' stance. The anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements from new programming and distribution strategies present significant upside potential, positioning Viacom well for sustainable future growth. Optimistically, these factors coupled with robust fiscal management should enhance Viacom's market position and deliver shareholder value in the upcoming fiscal periods.
