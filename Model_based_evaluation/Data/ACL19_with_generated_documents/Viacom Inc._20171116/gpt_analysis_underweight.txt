Based on the earnings conference call transcript, it is clear that Viacom has seen growth in revenue at both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment, as well as growth in operating free cash flow. However, there are several headwinds that the company is facing, particularly in the first half of fiscal 2018. These include pressure on domestic affiliate revenues, lower SVOD revenues, and subscriber declines. Additionally, there is a transitional impact from the renewed distributor relationships that will continue to affect the company's results, particularly in the first half of the year. As a result, the company anticipates high single-digit declines in domestic affiliate revenues in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2018.

With these factors in mind, as a financial analyst, I would adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on Viacom. While the company has shown growth in revenue and operating free cash flow, the headwinds it faces in the upcoming year may impact its overall performance. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding cash taxes and the timing of cost savings coming online may also impact the company's free cash flow growth. Therefore, I would advise caution in investing in Viacom at this time.
