In the recent earnings conference call transcript, Viacom reported strong financial results, including a 6% increase in revenue to $13.3 billion for the fiscal year, as well as a 26% increase in operating free cash flow. Adjusted earnings per share for the year increased by 2% to $3.77. In the quarter, Viacom generated $3.3 billion of revenue, up 3% over the prior year, and $578 million of adjusted operating income, a 7% increase.

In the Media Networks segment, both domestic and international revenues saw growth, with advertising revenues increasing by 6% and 36% respectively. Ancillary revenues also saw growth, up 5% and 21% for domestic and international, respectively. However, affiliate revenues declined by 1% and 3% for domestic and international, respectively. The decrease in affiliate revenues was attributed to lower SVOD and OTT agreements and a decline in subscribers, but was partially offset by mid single-digit contractual rate increases.

The Filmed Entertainment segment saw a 2% increase in revenues, driven by increases in license fees and ancillary revenue. Paramount Television also experienced significant growth, more than tripling its revenues in the fiscal year through successful releases such as Shooter, 13 Reasons Why, and Berlin Station.

For the fiscal year, Viacom generated $1.5 billion of operating free cash flow, a 26% increase over the prior year. The company also made meaningful progress in reducing gross debt by approximately $2 billion. Viacom's commitment to reducing leverage and maintaining investment-grade metrics was re-emphasized, with a focus on pursuing opportunities to delever in fiscal 2018.

Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, Viacom expects transitional impacts from renewed distributor relationships to continue flowing through the results, particularly in the first half of the year. However, the company anticipates pressure on domestic affiliate revenues to improve in the second half, resulting in a return to domestic growth as they move into fiscal 2019. International affiliate revenues are expected to continue growing in fiscal 2018.

Overall, the company forecasts a book tax rate of approximately 31% for fiscal 2018 and expects to pursue cost savings initiatives to drive margin and profitability. Viacom also anticipates hundreds of millions of dollars in operating income improvement for Paramount Pictures in fiscal 2018.

Taking into consideration the strong financial results and promising outlook for the future, I recommend adopting an 'overweight' investment stance on Viacom, as the company is well-positioned to capitalize on its growth opportunities in fiscal 2018 and beyond.
