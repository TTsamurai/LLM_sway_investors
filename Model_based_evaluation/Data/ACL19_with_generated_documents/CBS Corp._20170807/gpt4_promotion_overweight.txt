Title: Exceptional Growth and Strategic Mastery: Why CBS Corporation Represents an Overweight Investment Opportunity

Executive Summary:
CBS Corporation has continued to showcase robust financial performance and strategic foresight in a rapidly evolving media landscape. With consistent quarterly earnings growth, substantial advancements in the OTT space, strategic international expansions, and a diversified revenue stream less reliant on advertising, CBS stands out as a compelling investment opportunity. This report outlines why CBS Corporation warrants an 'overweight' investment stance, focusing on its unprecedented growth, strategic initiatives, and future profit potential.

Financial Excellence:
CBS Corporation has reported yet another triumphant quarter, marking the 30th consecutive quarter of EPS growth, with a 12% increase to $1.04 and revenue surging by 9% to $3.3 billion. Such performance is underpinned by top-line growth across all four business segments and substantial increases in non-advertising revenue, which now comprises 60% of total revenue. This shift from an advertising-reliant model towards diversified income streams highlights CBS’s strategic prowess in maximizing revenue stability and growth potential.

Strategic Expansion in OTT and International Markets:
CBS has impressively grown its OTT services, with CBS All Access and Showtime OTT on track to exceed 4 million subscribers, pushing rapidly towards a conservative early target of 8 million by 2020. Furthermore, CBS is expanding its OTT services internationally, starting in Canada, with plans to cover more countries, thereby tapping into a large global market. The introduction of original content tailored towards OTT platforms, including the much-anticipated "Star Trek: Discovery," positions CBS to capture a significant share of the burgeoning OTT market both domestically and internationally.

Innovative Approaches in Content and Distribution:
The company's strategy to own and produce a majority of its content has proven financially advantageous. By launching engaging content such as the new versions of "Dynasty" and exclusive rights sales to platforms like Netflix for "Star Trek: Discovery," CBS ensures substantial licensing revenues and profitability before shows even premiere. Additionally, CBS’s agility in embracing skinny bundles and collaborating with major digital platforms like Hulu, YouTube TV, and DIRECTV NOW enhances viewer reach and monetization of content across varied distribution channels.

Advertising Revenue and Upfront Success:
Contrary to the decline in traditional TV advertising, CBS has successfully navigated the changing terrain. The 2017 upfronts saw an increase, with high-single to double-digit pricing hikes. The introduction of extended metric deals (C7 and C35) enables CBS to capitalize on delayed viewing, significantly bumping the potential advertising revenue. This strategic foresight in advertising negotiations underscores CBS’s ability to adapt and thrive amidst industry shifts.

Recommendation:
Given CBS Corporation's robust financial performance, strategic expansion initiatives, and successful adaptation to industry changes, we strongly recommend an 'overweight' investment in CBS. Investors are poised to benefit from the continuous growth in EPS, revenue diversification strategies, and pioneering moves into new markets and platforms, setting CBS apart as a leader in the media industry with promising long-term returns.

We urge investors to consider the strategic positions and forward-looking initiatives that make CBS Corporation not just a survivor but a frontrunner in the rapidly evolving media industry. The blend of continuous financial growth, international market penetration, and innovative content distribution strategies heralds a bullish outlook, making CBS an essential addition to growth-focused investment portfolios.
