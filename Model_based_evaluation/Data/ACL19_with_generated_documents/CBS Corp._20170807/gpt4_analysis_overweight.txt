**Future Outlook Report: CBS Corporation**  
*Investment Stance: Overweight*

**Executive Summary:**  
CBS Corporation has exhibited impressive financial and strategic performance in its recent quarters, with a particular emphasis on diversifying revenue streams and expanding its digital presence globally. The latest earnings call highlighted several key areas of growth and strategic positioning that support an 'overweight' investment stance, reflecting the potential for sustained above-market performance.

**Financial Performance Overview:**  
CBS Corporation reported strong financial results, with a 9% increase in revenue reaching $3.3 billion and a 12% increase in EPS to $1.04, marking the 30th consecutive quarter of EPS growth. Both revenue and EPS have set new records for the company in the second quarter. This robust performance is underpinned by high growth in advertising revenue, significant expansion in OTT (Over-the-top) services, and increasing revenue from content licensing and distribution.

**Strategic Highlights and Future Growth Drivers:**

1. **Over-the-Top (OTT) Expansion:**
   CBS has made significant strides in strengthening its OTT platforms, namely CBS All Access and Showtime OTT, which are set to exceed 4 million combined subscribers before the end of 2017. This early achievement surpasses mid-term goals and sets a promising trajectory towards the 2020 target of 8 million subscribers. Additionally, the planned international expansion of CBS All Access starting in Canada in the first half of 2018, with subsequent launches in multiple countries, positions CBS to tap into the global OTT market, further boosting growth potential.

2. **Content Licensing and Profitability:**
   CBS’s strategic focus on owning a higher percentage of its content has led to enhanced profitability through licensing deals both domestically and internationally. Notable achievements include the licensing of the "Dynasty" reboot and "Star Trek: Discovery" to Netflix for international streaming, ensuring profitability before these shows have even aired. This model not only secures immediate revenue streams but also strengthens CBS’s bargaining power and long-term financial stability.

3. **Advertising Revenue Growth and Innovation:**
   The corporation continues to see robust growth in advertising revenues, supported by innovative sales strategies and adaptations to new metrics like C7 and C35, which better capture delayed viewing patterns. The promotion of key personnel and realignment of sales teams to leverage cross-platform opportunities further enhance CBS's capability to maximize its advertising revenues.

4. **Sports and News Segments Expansion:**
   CBS is expanding its footprint in sports through the development of a 24/7 live streaming sports channel and securing long-term rights with major leagues such as the NFL. The success of CBSN, its digital news platform, exemplifies the potential for high growth in digital news dissemination, with plans to replicate this success in sports.

**Risks and Considerations:**
While CBS shows strong growth and strategic positioning, risks such as increased competition in the OTT space, dependency on continued content success, and potential regulatory changes in media distribution should be monitored closely.

**Conclusion and Investment Rationale:**
Given CBS Corporation’s robust quarterly performance, strategic expansion in high-growth areas, and successful adaptation to industry shifts, we recommend an 'overweight' stance on CBS stock. The company's diversified revenue streams, aggressive digital expansion, and innovative content monetization strategies provide a solid foundation for future growth and resilience against industry disruptions.

**Recommendation:** Increase holdings in CBS Corporation; monitor strategic execution and market conditions for further portfolio adjustments.
