 and the other days of the week. In addition, our Thursday night product has been very successful for us, and if it's a good deal for us we would love to continue that. So I think we're very well positioned for the future. And I think, once again, you'll see us very active with the NFL going forward. Mike, on the programming, thanks for noticing. You know, we've stated in the past that we wanted to own a larger percentage of our programming, and as you've seen each season goes by, that continues. We took four new programs, obviously it's five because Big Bang is going forward, so that was five of 17. That's almost 30% of our programming we owned going forward. So we think it's a great business, plus as our volume goes up we think our margins will increase higher. So with each year going by, I think you'll see more and more CBS programming owned by CBS. Thank you all for joining us today. The future is very bright for CBS and a lot of this content is at an inflection point right now. The marketplace is just starting to accept it, and the more it does, the more successful we'll be. And as Joe said, we're well positioned not only through this year, but as Joe said, a good portion of our deals go for the next three to five years, and if we exceed we'll look to take more of that. Thanks again, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Goodbye.
