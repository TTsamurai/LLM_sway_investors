 to be the gold standard. To begin with, the company's revenue and EPS growth are very positive, delivering second quarter records. The increase in revenue to $3.3 billion and EPS to $1.04 showcases the company's success in the changing landscape. Additionally, the company's base advertising business is strong and growing, while also expanding into new ventures such as OTT services, international expansion, and sports streaming channels, demonstrating a proactive approach to future growth opportunities.

Furthermore, the company's successful OTT services, including CBS All Access and Showtime OTT, are set to exceed 4 million subscribers combined before the end of 2017. This demonstrates the company's ability to adapt to the changing distribution landscape and capitalize on the growing demand for streaming services. The expansion of CBS All Access into the international marketplace starting in the first half of 2018 also presents significant growth potential.

Moreover, the company's success in securing partnerships with virtual MVPDs and skinny bundles, including Hulu, YouTube TV, fubo, and DIRECTV NOW, contributes to increasing revenue and affiliate fees from carriage. The company's revenue mix achieving a 60%/40% split between non-advertising and advertising revenue reflects the success of diversifying revenue streams and ensures more reliability in earnings.

The company's ongoing success in content licensing, particularly with CBS Studios producing or co-producing more than 80% of the primetime schedule, indicates a strong position to monetize programming on air and online, domestically and internationally. Additionally, the company's partnerships with leading content producers like Imagine and the profitable licensing deals with platforms such as Netflix for shows like Star Trek: Discovery showcase the company's content monetization strategies.

In terms of news and sports, the company's successful expansion of CBSN and the establishment of a 24/7 live streaming channel for sports demonstrate the company's ability to adapt to the evolving digital landscape and capture new audiences. Additionally, the company's proactive approach to M&A and competition in the sports and news arenas positions it to be a leading player in the industry.

Overall, the company's strategic initiatives and successful execution across various segments, including OTT services, content licensing, advertising, news, and sports, indicate a positive outlook for future growth and profitability.

Based on these insights and financial metrics, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance on the company, as it is well-positioned to continue delivering strong performance and capturing new opportunities in the evolving media and entertainment industry.
