. But obviously, as these rights come up for bidding, you're going to have digital players coming in as well. We think we'll be aggressive, but we'll be smart about it as we always have. And once again, it's a really important part of our programming going forward. And going back to the question on sports, really, as we've said, it's in the very early stages, and we're very proactive in the area. Like news, like streaming news, it's an opportunity that wasn't there just a few years ago. So yes, it's a positive, and once again, each year it will expand for us. Christine, the question about our content licensing, obviously we own an enormous amount of content, and the more platforms that we'll have, the better. And as I said, we made a decision with Star Trek to keep it specifically for All Access. We could've sold it to Amazon, Netflix or Showtime, certainly Showtime wanted it. But we thought that property was perfect to grow our revenue stream. And once again, so it is in every way we look at it. I think and Leslie could talk about it more, Steve, you obviously look at our library, it's enormous and obviously all of that could go on other platforms as well. Yes, I'll talk about the schedule. We're going to be announcing it very soon. We think that obviously with the NFL it gives us programming every Sunday, so that's a very big advantage over others in terms of having Sunday programming. Star Trek is going to run until the beginning of 2018, and it will be succeeded by other original series seem about to start that go continuously throughout the year. So we will have a constant stream of new content going onto the service. And I'll make Vice News Now go into Brazil. Joe, do you want to take the first part and I'll take the second? Obviously the international expansion, 4 million subs today with a target of 8 million by 2020, we're already more than halfway there, starting off in Canada is really very good. Showtime, obviously the OTT and selling the fight, it's a new revenue opportunity for us, it's something that we've talked about doing and it's something that we'll get compensated greatly for. So it's great. Obviously CBSN continuing to grow, it's a great thing for us, and eventually, streaming sports is a big thing for us, and CBS Sports, by the way, is a very good moneymaker for us. So those are the things that are obviously the case. Yes, good strategic expansion in Canada. The market's big there and it's growing. In addition, the Mayweather-McGregor fight on Showtime OTT, it's a great opportunity for us to leverage our brand, and it's definitely a moneymaker. So those are the great factors. And with that, we come to the end of our call. Thank you very much for your time.
