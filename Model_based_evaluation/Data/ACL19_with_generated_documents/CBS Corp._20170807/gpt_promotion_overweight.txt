My report can be summarized as follows:

CBS Corporation has had a successful quarter with revenue and EPS both up, showing continued growth and strong performance. The company is focused on adapting to changes in the industry, including expanding their OTT services and streaming offerings internationally. With strong advertising revenue and a focus on content licensing and production, CBS is well-positioned for success in the future. The company's investment in sports and news programming, as well as its shift towards digital platforms, also offer great potential for growth and profitability. Overall, CBS Corporation presents a compelling investment opportunity, with a clear strategy for sustained success and a strong revenue mix. Based on these factors, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance in the company.
