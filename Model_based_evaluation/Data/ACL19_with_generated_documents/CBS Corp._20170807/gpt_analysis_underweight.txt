 to be a major player there. The Super Bowl â€“ there has not been a hard number yet, but our philosophy has always been if we can't air it nationally, we don't want it. And so from every indication, it looks like the Super Bowl should be aired nationally and we don't anticipate any issue. And obviously the NFL is a great business partner for us, so we think we're in good shape on that going forward.

Based on the company's recent earnings call, it is clear that CBS Corporation has experienced significant growth in various areas of their business, particularly in the OTT and international expansion. The company's venture into the OTT market has resulted in a 9% increase in revenue to $3.3 billion, with significant growth in subscription numbers for CBS All Access and Showtime OTT. Furthermore, the company's plans to expand into the international marketplace further showcase their commitment to growth and success.

In addition to their OTT success, CBS has also seen growth in non-advertising revenue, with a 60%/40% split between non-advertising and advertising revenue, marking a record for the company. This diversification of revenue sources provides more certainty in earnings and has led to faster-growing and more reliable revenue.

While the company has seen success in various segments, it is important to note that there are potential risks and challenges that could impact future growth. With increasing competition in the OTT market and the changing landscape of distribution, there is a need for the company to continue to innovate and adapt to these changes in order to maintain their competitive edge.

Furthermore, while the company has demonstrated impressive growth in content licensing, particularly in their international content sales, there is a need to monitor and carefully manage the monetization of content in the international marketplace to ensure continued success and profitability.

Taking into consideration the company's strong performance in various segments, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for CBS Corporation. While the company has shown signs of growth and success, there are potential risks and challenges that could impact future performance. It is important to carefully monitor the company's ability to navigate the changing landscape of distribution and the OTT market, as well as the management of content monetization in the international marketplace.
