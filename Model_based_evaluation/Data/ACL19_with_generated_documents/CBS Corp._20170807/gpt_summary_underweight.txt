 Based on the recent earnings call transcript, I would recommend an 'underweight' investment stance for CBS Corporation. Despite the company's strong financial performance, with revenue up 9% to $3.3 billion and EPS up 12% to $1.04, there are several key concerns that justify a cautious stance.

First, while the company has seen growth in every business segment, there is significant uncertainty in the media landscape due to the rise of OTT services and skinny bundles. The expansion of OTT services, international market entry, and partnerships with streaming platforms represent a shift in consumer behavior that could impact traditional revenue streams.

Additionally, while the company's content licensing and distribution have been successful, there is growing competition in the digital arena from players like Netflix and Amazon. The company's ability to monetize content internationally and navigate the changing distribution landscape may face challenges.

Furthermore, despite successful advertising revenue, there are concerns about the shift in advertising models from C3 to C7 and up to C35, and the impact on revenue. The company's reliance on advertising revenue may face challenges as consumer viewing habits evolve.

In light of these uncertainties and the rapidly changing media landscape, an 'underweight' investment stance would be prudent until there is greater clarity and stability in the company's ability to adapt to the evolving market dynamics.
