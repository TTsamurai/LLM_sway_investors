**CBS Corporation Investment Analysis Report**

**Recommendation: Underweight**

**Introduction:**
In this report, we offer a cautious evaluation of CBS Corporation, emphasizing potential risks and areas of concern despite the company's continued growth in revenue and expansion into over-the-top (OTT) services. While CBS has reported significant achievements and appears to be diversifying its revenue streams, there are underlying aspects that potential investors should consider.

**Financial Overview:**
CBS has showcased a strong financial performance with a 9% increase in revenue to $3.3 billion and a 12% rise in EPS to $1.04. These figures mark continuous growth across the companyâ€™s various segments. However, this aggressive expansion and emphasis on OTT services may harbor risks linked to high operational costs and a competitive streaming market.

**Advertising Reliance Despite Diversification:**
Although CBS has successfully reduced its reliance on advertising from over 70% a decade ago to 40%, the company is still significantly tethered to this cyclic and volatile revenue segment. Notably, with the rapid evolution of media consumption behaviors, reliance even on a 40% advertising revenue might pose a risk in terms of long-term sustainability and exposure to market downturns.

**OTT and International Expansion Risks:**
CBS is ambitiously expanding its OTT services, including CBS All Access, setting a target of 8 million subscribers by 2020. Moreover, the international rollout of these platforms could face considerable execution and competitive risks, as the streaming market abroad is intensely competitive, dominated by entrenched players like Netflix. The vast investments needed for content creation and rights acquisition internationally might not yield proportional returns.

**Content Licensing Volatility:**
CBS's strategic shift toward content licensing and production is apparent, boasting the initiation of numerous shows and partnerships. While this pivot diversifies revenue and reduces some risks associated with broadcasting and advertising, it requires high initial expenditures with uncertain payback periods, especially in a landscape where content consumption is rapidly changing.

**Competition and Market Saturation:**
The market for streaming services is highly saturated, with numerous large and well-established competitors. The rapid pace of CBS's OTT launch and expansion conveys optimism but also brings forth risks associated with customer acquisition costs, churn rates, and the continuous necessity to invest heavily in original content in an already crowded space.

**Regulatory and Operational Risks:**
CBS's expansion into global markets will subject it to diverse regulatory environments, posing compliance costs and risks. Operational challenges, including the integration of international services and content rights management across different jurisdictions, may also impose additional burdens on the company's resources.

**Conclusion:**
While CBS Corporation demonstrates strong financial growth and ambitious expansion efforts, the broader context of rapidly shifting media consumption, high competition in the global streaming market, reliance on advertising revenues, and the potential overheads associated with content licensing and international operations contribute to a cautious outlook. Therefore, we recommend an 'underweight' stance on CBS Corporation shares, advising potential investors to weigh these risks heavily in their investment decisions. This stance is taken to acknowledge the potential for growth while recognizing significant uncertainties in the corporation's strategic direction and market conditions.
