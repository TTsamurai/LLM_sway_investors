. Joe, need I say more? I think our mantra is "we can't be a new bundle without CBS" pretty much sums it up. Also, as Joe mentioned during the call, we are making over $1 billion, and that is growing which shows the potential for success in international expansion. Regarding advertising, with our new upfront rates, more primetime hours to sell without the political preemptions of last year, and more money in the marketplace without the Summer Olympics, we are extremely well-positioned for success in the back half of 2017. In addition, we have political again in 2018 and the Super Bowl back in 2019. As for news, 60 Minutes continues to dominate in the ratings and has remained the most watched news program this summer despite the direct competition of a new news magazine. Our average news viewer age is 20 years below what it is on the network, showing the potential for growth and success. As for sports, with our proactive online sports group, we have the infrastructure that allows CBSN to thrive, which obviously will be used there as well. We have deals with the NFL, the NCAA, FCC football, PGA Tour Golf, and various other areas which positions us as a big player in the sports industry. With our capacity and output growing rapidly, our content licensing is more active than ever, and we have deals that will begin new recurring revenue streams for Showtime that will benefit us for years to come. Our late-night shows, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and The Late Late Show with James Corden, have incredible momentum and have been recognized with several big Emmy nominations. Also, our recent M&A with DIRECTV NOW and deals with various skinny bundles have shown the potential for significant growth and success. Overall, with our diverse revenue mix and the successful positioning of our company, CBS is set up for success and we know how to get the job done. We look forward to delivering for our shareholders in the quarters and years ahead just as we've been doing for a long, long time. ROI is looking really good for us!
