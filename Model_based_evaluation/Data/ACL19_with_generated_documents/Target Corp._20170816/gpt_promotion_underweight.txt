the trends. Our sales and margin forecasts have been based on unit growth, trip growth and dollar growth over time. We have been cautious in our approach and have invested ahead of the trends, focusing on value perception and ensuring we are priced right daily on key items. We have seen positive response from guests in terms of awareness and return on ad spend for our campaigns. We have also seen a stronger mix of regular price selling in the second quarter, and our unit share in key categories has grown more quickly than dollar share. Additionally, we have reduced our total inventory and improved the quality of our inventory, creating capacity for us to invest in new and successful products. We have a lot of new brands launching in the next few months and we plan to support these launches with significant marketing and digital investments. Our back-to-school and back-to-college seasons are also key for our third quarter results, and we are confident in our plans to extend our record of comp and market share growth in these categories. While there are opportunities for growth, we are also being cautious in our forecasts and investments, and we are monitoring and measuring our progress to iterate based on the response. Therefore, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance for the company at this time, given the cautious approach we are taking in our forecasts and investments.
