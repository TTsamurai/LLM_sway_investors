Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for Comerica. Here are some key financial metrics to consider:

1. Loan Portfolios: The average loans in the fourth quarter remained stable compared to the third quarter, with a reduction in the energy portfolio and robust declines in environmental services and general middle market. The quarter ended with loans at $49.1 billion, with mortgage banker contributing the largest decline.

2. Deposit Growth: Deposit growth was robust, increasing almost 3% over the third quarter. Deposit costs remained low at 14 basis points as the company continued to prudently manage pricing for relationship-oriented deposits.

3. Net Interest Income and Margin: Net interest income increased $5 million, while the net interest margin decreased 1 basis point. Interest earned on loans increased $1 million quarter-over-quarter, and the loan yield increased 3 basis points. Wholesale funding costs decreased $1 million.

4. Credit Quality: The overall credit picture remains strong, with total criticized loans declining over $400 million and representing less than 5% of total loans. Net charge-offs were at the low end of the historical range, and the allowance for credit losses and allowance-to-loan ratio remained stable.

5. Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income fell slightly from robust levels seen in the third quarter, with growth in card fees and fiduciary and foreign exchange income offset by declines in commercial lending fees and non-fee categories.

6. Expenses: Non-interest expenses decreased $32 million, primarily due to the GEAR Up initiative contributing more than $25 million to the decline. Salaries and benefits expense declined due to a reduction in workforce and reduced pension expense.

7. Capital Management: The company maintained strong capital ratios and returned excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The 2016 capital plan included share repurchases of up to $440 million.

8. Potential Developments: Rising rates and potential changes in tax regulations could impact the company's financial performance. The recent increase in rates benefited the company's asset-sensitive balance sheet, and the new administration's plans for tax reductions, regulatory relief, and fiscal stimulus could also have an impact.

Based on the above financial metrics and the management's insights provided during the earnings call, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended for Comerica. The company's strong credit quality, robust deposit growth, and capital management initiatives indicate potential for growth and value creation for investors. However, it is important to closely monitor potential developments, such as changes in interest rates and tax regulations, to adapt investment strategies accordingly.
