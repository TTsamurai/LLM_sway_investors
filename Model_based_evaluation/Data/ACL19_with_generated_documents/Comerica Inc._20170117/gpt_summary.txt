The earnings conference call transcripts highlight some key financial metrics for the company. These metrics include loan balances, deposit growth, net interest income, non-interest income, non-interest expenses, capital management and potential developments that could enhance financial performance.

Loan balances remained stable in the fourth quarter, with growth in commercial real estate offset by declines in mortgage banker, environmental services, and general middle market. Deposits grew by almost 3% over the third quarter and the deposit costs remained low at 14 basis points.

Net interest income increased by $5 million, while the net interest margin decreased by 1 basis point. The company experienced a decrease in non-interest expenses, particularly in salaries and benefits expenses due to workforce reduction and pension expense reduction.

Capital management was highlighted, with the company returning excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The company's confidence in completing the $440 million buyback increased, and the average diluted share count increased by 1 million shares due to the rise in share price.

Potential developments that could enhance financial performance include the impact of rising interest rates, the new administration's plans for reducing taxes and providing regulatory relief, and the impact of expenses on revenue growth, loans, and technology.

Overall, the company is focused on managing its capital, maintaining strong capital ratios, and prudently managing pricing for relationship-oriented deposits. The company is closely monitoring the market and competition and is well positioned to act quickly to adapt to changes in tax regulations and other potential developments.
