Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. The average loans in the fourth quarter were relatively stable compared to the third quarter, but there was a decrease in the mortgage banker business due to the fall slowdown in home sales. The energy portfolio also saw a reduction, and there were declines in environmental services and general middle market. Additionally, non-interest income fell slightly, expenses decreased due to GEAR Up initiative, and there were lease termination gains last year that are not expected to repeat. It is also noted that the company is monitoring the market and competition closely and may adjust deposit pricing if necessary. The potential impact of rising rates and changes in tax regulations are uncertain. Therefore, considering these factors, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended.
