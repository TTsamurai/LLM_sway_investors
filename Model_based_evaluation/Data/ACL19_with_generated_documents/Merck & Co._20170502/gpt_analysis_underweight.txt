Based on the above analysis, we can adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. Despite the company's solid start in the first quarter of 2017, there are concerns about the decline in sales due to LOEs (Loss of Exclusivity) and the anticipation of further erosion from these products in 2017. While there have been positive developments with products such as KEYTRUDA, ZEPATIER, and GARDASIL, the company's overall performance may be impacted by these declining sales.

Furthermore, the market for HCV (Hepatitis C Virus) treatment is seen as a declining market, with challenges in getting new patients into the buying process. This poses a potential risk to the company's overall revenue and growth prospects.

The company may also face challenges with increased competition and pricing strategies in the healthcare market, particularly in regions like Japan and Europe.

In conclusion, while there have been positive developments in the company's product portfolio, the potential impact of declining sales, market challenges, and increased competition suggests a more cautious investment stance. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment position may be warranted for the company at this time.
