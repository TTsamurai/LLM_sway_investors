To whom it may concern,

After analyzing the recent earnings conference call transcript, I am adopting an ‘underweight’ investment stance for the company based on the following key financial metrics:

1. Global Human Health Sales: While the company reported a 2% increase in sales, it is important to note that this growth was primarily driven by launched products such as KEYTRUDA, BRIDION, and ZEPATIER, as well as the vaccines portfolio. The impact of LOEs in the U.S. had a negative effect on sales.

2. Performance in the United States: The company experienced strong growth in the U.S., particularly in the oncology segment with significant sales of KEYTRUDA in the first quarter. However, sales for the JANUVIA franchise declined by 5% in the U.S.

3. Vaccines Sales: The sales of vaccines, particularly GARDASIL and PNEUMOVAX, saw significant growth, driven by increased demand and favorable timing of CDC purchases. However, the impact of the transition to a two-dose regimen in the U.S. remains a potential risk.

4. Hospital and Specialty Care: The sales of ZEPATIER and BRIDION showed positive growth, with ZEPATIER generating $378 million in sales for the quarter and BRIDION experiencing growth of more than 60%. However, the HCV market is declining, and the company anticipates further erosion from LOEs in 2017.

5. KEYTRUDA's Performance: While the company reported strong sales for KEYTRUDA, particularly in the U.S. for first-line lung, it is important to note that the market share in non-small lung cancer is about 25%, and there is increasing competition in the market.

Based on these financial metrics, along with the potential impact of LOEs and competition in the market, I recommend an ‘underweight’ investment stance for the company.
