**Earnings Conference Call Summary Q1 2017**

**Overall Financial Highlights:**

1. **Global Sales and Performance:**
   - Global Human Health sales were reported at $8.2 billion, marking a 2% increase. This growth is attributed to strong performances from products such as KEYTRUDA, BRIDION, and ZEPATIER, as well as from the extensive portfolio of vaccines, which helped counterbalance the impact of Loss of Exclusivity (LOEs) in the U.S.
   - Notable growth in sales outside the U.S. was 7%.

2. **Impact of Loss of Exclusivity (LOEs):**
   - The company faced a nearly $700 million decline in sales due to LOEs and anticipates further erosions in 2017. However, it aims to mitigate these losses through its broad portfolio and multiple new product launches.

**Key Products and Franchise Performances:**

1. **Oncology (KEYTRUDA):**
   - Q1 sales: $584 million, showing significant growth driven primarily by its adoption in the first-line lung cancer treatment and expansion in indications.
   - The U.S. recorded a 170% increase in KEYTRUDA sales, spearheaded by its effectiveness and widespread prescription in lung cancer. KEYTRUDA now leads as the most commonly prescribed drug in first-line lung settings.
   - Outside the U.S., melanoma remains a primary sales driver, with ongoing expansions in lung cancer indications expected to boost international contributions significantly.

2. **Primary Care (JANUVIA Franchise):**
   - Q1 sales: $1.3 billion, a decrease of 5% mainly due to uneven buying patterns in the U.S. despite a TRx growth of about 3% in the country.
   - Despite the decline, JANUVIA continues to dominate the DPP-4 inhibitor market, holding over 70% market share in the U.S. and 65% globally.

3. **Vaccines:**
   - Q1 sales reached $1.5 billion, an increase of 21%, driven largely by GARDASIL and PNEUMOVAX.
   - The termination of the vaccine joint venture with Sanofi, which contributed approximately $65 million, mostly from GARDASIL sales, also bolstered growth figures.
   - GARDASIL alone saw a 41% increase in sales owing to strong demand in the U.S. and emerging markets.

4. **Hospital and Specialty Care:**
   - BRIDION and ZEPATIER reflected strong quarterly performances with ZEPATIER earning $378 million. The notable uptake in Europe and Japan and a favorable adjustment in rebate accruals contributed to this growth.
   - BRIDION also demonstrated more than 60% growth, with solid increases in demand across the U.S., Europe, and emerging markets.

**Strategic Outlook and Future Plans:**

- The company expressed confidence in the sustained growth and market penetration of KEYTRUDA, especially with the introduction of KEYNOTE-021G which expands the treatment landscape to include nonsquamous patients without PD-L1 expression.
- Continued focus on expanding its diabetes franchise with upcoming filings and approvals expected to enrich the JANUVIA lineup.
- Anticipation of growing contributions from international markets for both vaccines and oncology products as new approvals and reimbursements are obtained.
- Persistent effort towards offsetting LOEs with robust sales and new product launches to maintain overall growth trajectory.


**Conclusion:**
Despite challenges posed by LOEs, the company's diversified portfolio and strategic product launches have enabled it to sustain growth and bolster its market position across key therapeutic areas. With ongoing developments in oncology and vaccines, coupled with strong leadership in diabetes care, the outlook remains optimistic for continued progress and profitability.
