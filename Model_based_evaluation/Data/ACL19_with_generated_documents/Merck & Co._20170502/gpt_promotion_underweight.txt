 it's only a matter of time until we see demand for KEYTRUDA increase in these markets as well. The steady increase in testing and utilization of KEYTRUDA reflects its potential to become a preferred treatment option for various indications. Additionally, the strong performance of our vaccines, particularly GARDASIL and PNEUMOVAX, demonstrates sustained demand and growth in the market. Our ongoing success with ZEPATIER and BRIDION also bodes well for our position in the hospital and specialty care markets. While we continue to face challenges with LOEs and a decline in HCV patient numbers, we are confident in our ability to offset these losses with our diverse portfolio of products. Thank you, and now I'll open up the call for questions.

Based on the company's recent earnings call, it is clear that they have seen strong growth in various product lines, particularly KEYTRUDA, GARDASIL, PNEUMOVAX, ZEPATIER, and BRIDION. The company has reported growth in sales and increased demand for their products, despite potential challenges with LOEs and a declining market for HCV treatments. The positive outlook for their products and their future potential indicates a strong performance in the market.

However, as a stock promoter tasked with providing a cautious or skeptical perspective, it is important to consider the potential risks and challenges the company may face. Despite the positive performance of their products, the company still faces the impact of LOEs, which could lead to a decline in sales and revenue. Additionally, the declining market for HCV treatments and the challenges in expanding reimbursement for products outside the U.S. could pose risks to their financial performance.

While the company's products have shown strong growth and potential, it is important to approach their investment with caution and consider the potential impact of these risks on their future performance. Therefore, based on the company's recent earnings call and the potential risks they face, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. This approach acknowledges the positive performance of their products but also considers the potential challenges and risks that could impact their future financial performance.
