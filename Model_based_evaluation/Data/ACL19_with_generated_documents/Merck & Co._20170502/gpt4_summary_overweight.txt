### Summary Report: Earnings Conference Call Q1 2017

#### Overview
Global Human Health (GHH) has reported a positive start for Q1 2017, demonstrating robust performance across multiple product lines. Global sales reached $8.2 billion, marking a 2% increase. This growth is primarily attributed to newly launched products and a strong vaccines portfolio, counteracting the revenue losses due to Loss of Exclusivity (LOE) in the U.S. Key highlights include significant growth in oncology, specifically with KEYTRUDA, notable advances in the hospital and specialty care segments with ZEPATIER and BRIDION, and outstanding progress in the vaccines sector, especially with GARDASIL sales.

#### Key Financial Metrics

**Sales Performance:**
- **Oncology:** KEYTRUDA sales grew globally to $584 million, with a dramatic increase by approximately 170% in the U.S., primarily driven by its adoption in first-line lung cancer treatment.
- **Primary Care:** JANUVIA franchise sales were down by 5% to $1.3 billion, despite a TRx growth of 3% in the U.S.
- **Vaccines:** Sales surged to $1.5 billion, a 21% increase, driven by GARDASIL and PNEUMOVAX, significantly benefiting from the termination of a joint venture with Sanofi.
- **Hospital and Specialty Care:** ZEPATIER sales reached $378 million with a $40 million favourable rebate adjustment. BRIDION showed over 60% growth enhancing its market share across various regions.

#### Market Share and Growth Opportunites:
- **KEYTRUDA:** It has solidified its position as the leading prescribed drug in the first-line lung cancer setting in the U.S., with expansion into markets outside the U.S., particularly for melanoma and lung cancers. Further penetration is expected as reimbursement processes are streamlined internationally.
- **GARDASIL:** Exhibits strong demand with a growth of 41% this quarter, alongside the achievement of a greater than 90% market share globally. 
- **ZEPATIER and BRIDION:** Both continue to receive positive feedback globally, significantly influencing the hospital and specialty care markets.

#### Strategic Initiatives:
- **Launch Expansion:** KEYTRUDA, now approved in almost 60 countries, expands indications including potentially broad market opportunities in nonsquamous patients and those with low or no PD-L1 expression.
- **Market Penetration:** Continued efforts to promote PD-L1 testing to boost KEYTRUDA adoption. Expansion in vaccine uptake, particularly GARDASIL through improved CDC purchase timings and extended market reach.
- **New Product Filings:** Pipeline developments such as the SGLT2 combination with JANUVIA, which could potentially rejuvenate the primary care segment by expanding the therapeutic portfolio.

#### Risks and Mitigations:
- **Dependency on KEYTRUDA:** Given the substantial part of revenue generated, any setbacks in clinical trials or regulatory challenges could impact overall performance.
- **Market Volatility in Primary Care:** Price erosion or accelerated competition in the DPP-4 inhibitor category could further pressure JANUVIAâ€™s market position despite its current leadership.

#### Investment Stance (Overweight):
- **Growth Trajectory:** Considering the robust sales growth driven by KEYTRUDA and the vaccines, and strategic expansion into emerging markets, there is a strong indication of continued positive performance.
- **Innovation and Pipeline Strength:** Continuously expanding indications and global reach for flagship products, coupled with promising new launches, underpin a solid growth foundation making the stock an attractive investment.
- **Market Leadership:** Sustained leadership in multiple therapeutic categories reinforces a competitive market stance.

In conclusion, despite challenges from LOEs, the company is well-positioned for sustained growth leveraging its strong product portfolio and strategic market expansions. The current outlook supports an 'overweight' investment recommendation based on robust quarterly performance and strategic positioning for future growth.
