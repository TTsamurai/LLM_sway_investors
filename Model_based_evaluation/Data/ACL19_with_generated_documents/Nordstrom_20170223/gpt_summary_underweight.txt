. Thank you for providing the transcript. Based on the information provided, it is evident that Nordstrom has made significant improvements in various areas such as inventory management, operating cash flow, and online sales growth. However, the company is also facing challenges with declining profitability in its full-line stores and the impact of heavy investments in new market opportunities and technology.

In terms of key financial metrics, it is important to note the following:
1. Operating cash flow of $1.6 billion in 2016 exceeded the five-year historical average, reflecting improved working capital and inventory management.
2. Free cash flow of $550 million benefited from a reduction in CapEx, indicating efficient capital expenditure allocation.
3. Record sales of $14.5 billion in 2016, with e-commerce representing nearly one-quarter of the business.
4. Profit margins in the e-commerce business have surpassed those in the store business, indicating a shift in consumer behavior.

In light of this information, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on Nordstrom. The company's profitability challenges in full-line stores and the significant investments in new market opportunities and technology are likely to continue putting pressure on profitability in the near term. Additionally, the shift in consumer behavior towards e-commerce may further impact the company's overall profitability. Therefore, it is advisable to approach investment in Nordstrom with caution, considering the current challenges and investment requirements.
