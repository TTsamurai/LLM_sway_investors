Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, there are several key insights and financial metrics that indicate a need to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for Nordstrom. Here are the reasons for this stance:

1. Declining profitability in full-line stores: The company reported a contraction in retail EBIT due to soft business in its full-line stores. This is a red flag for investors as it indicates declining profitability in a key segment of the business.

2. Impact of e-commerce on overall profitability: The transcript highlights that the profitability of Nordstrom's e-commerce business has started to surpass the margins in the store-based business. While this is a positive trend in terms of e-commerce growth, it also signifies a shift in the overall profitability dynamics, signaling potential challenges in traditional brick-and-mortar stores.

3. Heavy investment in technology and fulfillment: The company plans to invest roughly $3.4 billion over the next five years, with a significant portion allocated towards modernizing its tech platform, digital and mobile enhancements, and expanding the fulfillment network. While these investments are necessary for multi-channel growth, they are also expected to put pressure on the company's overall profitability in the near term.

4. Impact of new market opportunities on profitability: Nordstrom has made significant investments in new market opportunities such as Nordstromrack.com, HauteLook, Canada, and Trunk Club. While the company expects improved operating performance from these investments, the transcript indicates that they have contributed to increased pre-opening costs. This suggests a potential drag on profitability in the short term.

5. Stagnating comp sales and negative trends in full-line stores: The company's outlook incorporates flat comp sales and negative trends in full-line stores, offset by outsized online growth. This indicates challenges in driving growth in its traditional retail segment and a heavy reliance on e-commerce to offset these challenges.

6. Evolving business model and realignment of resources: Nordstrom is undergoing significant changes in its business model to support long-term profitable growth. While this is a positive strategic move, it also indicates a period of transition and potential volatility in financial performance.

Based on these insights and financial metrics, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended for Nordstrom, as the company faces challenges in traditional retail segments, heavy investment in technology and new market opportunities, and a transition period in its business model. Investors may want to exercise caution and closely monitor the company's ability to navigate these challenges and deliver sustainable profitability.
