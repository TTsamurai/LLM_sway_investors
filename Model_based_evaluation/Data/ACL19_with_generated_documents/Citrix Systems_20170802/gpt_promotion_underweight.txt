Based on the cautious and skeptical perspective outlined in the company's recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on Citrix. While there was positive talk about revenue growth and customer demand, there are concerns about the impact of the rapid shift to a subscription-based model on the company's profitability in the short term. The company acknowledges that the move to subscription is impacting the P&L and that they are experiencing pressures due to the cloud transition. Additionally, there are uncertainties around expenses and investments, as well as the potential impact on renewal rates and average selling prices due to the mandatory migration to subscription-based models.

While the company's leadership team is working on a multiyear plan, including accelerating the shift to a subscription-based model and margin expansion, there is a lack of specific details and metrics at this time. The company plans to share these details on the next quarter's call.

Furthermore, while there were mentions of strong product portfolio and roadmap, along with positive customer wins and partnerships, the competitive environment was described as hypercompetitive, with a focus on integrations, features, and performance rather than price. It is important to note that the company does not lead on price and is not relying on price competitiveness as a long-term strategy.

Overall, the skepticism arises from the rapid shift to a subscription-based model impacting short-term profitability, uncertainties around expenses, and the lack of specific details and metrics on the multiyear plan at this time. It is advisable to approach investment in Citrix with caution until more clarity and specifics are provided.
