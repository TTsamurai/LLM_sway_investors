for your question, Mike. In terms of pricing discipline within the industry, we do not expect any change in that dynamic. Our focus is on serving our major customer by providing the best quality paint and service in the industry. On the other hand, regarding the acceleration of the investment in display and advertising costs for our plumbing segment, we have seen positive returns on these investments, leading us to be bullish on this expenditure. Overall, our outlook for the full year remains steady, with mid-single digit growth and modest margin erosion. Additionally, we have seen growth in our Pro business and expect to achieve the Pro growth that we forecasted. As for our capital allocation priorities, we prioritize investing in the business first, followed by rebalancing M&A activity versus share repurchase activity. We have also raised the dividend four times over the last four years and will continue to consider similar activity in 2018. Finally, we expect similar display and advertising spend in the plumbing segment in 2018. We will provide more guidance on this in our February call. Thank you.
