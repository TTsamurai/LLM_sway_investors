**Future Outlook Report for GGP Inc.**

To the Board of Directors and Investment Stakeholders,

**Overview:**
In light of GGP Inc.’s recent earnings call and based on a comprehensive review of the financial, strategic, and operational elements disclosed therein, this report advocates for an ‘overweight’ stance on GGP Inc.’s investment. The decision to recommend this position is rooted in the company's robust strategic initiatives, solid financial performance, potential market opportunities, and pending real estate redevelopment outcomes.

**Strategic and Operational Highlights:**

1. **Real Estate Portfolio and Location Advantage:**
   GGP Inc. stands out in the industry with its premier real estate holdings characterized by strategic urban and suburban infill locations. The company’s ability to draw substantial traffic—enabled by centers being within an hour’s drive of 56% of the U.S. population—demonstrates potential for steady revenue streams. Significant leasing activities and the diversified nature of offerings in these locations should drive consistent growth.

2. **Redevelopment and Densification Projects:**
   The company has taken clear strides in optimizing its real estate through redevelopments aimed at diversifying use and increasing utility. For instance, recapturing and re-tenanting of department store boxes have met with successful leasing, capturing high-value tenants and reducing vacancy rates. Planned and ongoing projects promise considerable upside, enhancing shareholder value.

3. **Strategic Stakeholder Engagement:**
   With Brookfield's increased ownership at 34% via a significant capital infusion, there is clearly strong backing by major stakeholders. The capital will be leveraged for asset enhancements, debt pay down, or share repurchase, which will support the stock stabilization and growth.

4. **Financial Stability and Performance Metrics:**
   The company reported a solid Fund from Operations (FFO) of $0.35 per share for Q2, aligned with market expectations, representing a stable operational outcome. Gross operating income increased modestly, while specific focus on non-apparel NOI revealed stronger performance, highlighting strategic realignment away from dependent apparel retail.

5. **Dividends and Shareholder Returns:**
   A 10% increase in dividends reflects confidence in future cash flows, reinforcing the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders. Furthermore, a potential share repurchasing plan, backed by a board authorization of nearly $400 million, signals a proactive approach to enhancing shareholder value.

**Market Position and Competitive Edge:**
GGP's well-articulated strategy to hone its A-rated centers – which generate the bulk of its business – is a testament to its market positioning. The growth in NOI and effective handling of leasing spreads, even in a challenging retail environment, differentiate GGP from its competitors.

**Risks and Considerations:**
While the outlook is predominantly positive, it is imperative to acknowledge potential risks such as further retail bankruptcies impacting NOI, potential economic downturns affecting consumer spending, and execution risks related to substantial redevelopment projects.

**Recommendation:**
Based on the analysis, GGP Inc. presents a compelling investment opportunity driven by its strategic real estate management, solid financial footing, and strong investor confidence. The recommended 'overweight' investment stance is advised to capitalize on the expected continued resilience and growth of the company.

**Conclusion:**
GGP Inc. is well-positioned for sustained growth and profitability. Continued focus on strategic redevelopment, prudent capital management, and leveraging location advantages are anticipated to underpin further value generation and robust financial returns.

This outlook report asserts that maintaining or increasing investment in GGP Inc. will yield tangible benefits and aligns with long-term strategic financial objectives.
