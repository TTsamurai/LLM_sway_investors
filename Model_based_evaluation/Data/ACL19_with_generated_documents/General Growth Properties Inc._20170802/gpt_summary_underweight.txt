Summary Report:

Company FFO per diluted share for the second quarter was $0.35, consistent with guidance and consensus. Company NOI increased 1.3%, primarily impacted by store closures, but would have been 3% growth excluding bankruptcy impact. NO weighted sales per square foot increased 1.7% to $705, demonstrating portfolio quality. Total sales excluding apparel increased 3.1%. NOI weighted sales without apparel was $906 per square foot. Lease spreads were up 10% and new lease spreads were up over 18%, showing demand for space. Guidance for the year is $1.56 to $1.60 per share with NOI growth reaccelerating 3% to 4% in the second half. The board declared a $0.22 quarterly dividend, a 10% increase from last year.

A-rated centers within the portfolio drive 75% of NOI and expected to grow nearly 4% this year. NOI weighted sales per square foot increased 2.5% to $785. Total sales excluding apparel increased 4.7% and lease spreads were up 12%. Occupancy is at 95% and traffic to the centers is up 1.4% year-to-date. The company has been adding non-retail uses at its properties with over 100 new tenants this year, including e-commerce retailers planning to open stores.

The company has been acquiring, redeveloping, and re-tenanting anchor boxes within the portfolio, with strong demand for vacated department store boxes given the quality of the real estate. The company has sold over 60 lower quality assets over the last two years and plans to continue pruning the portfolio.

The company has concluded that staying the course and continuing its current strategy under the direction of its experienced team will produce the best long-term results for shareholders. The board has decided to utilize cash from Brookfield's exercise of in-the-money warrants for the enhanced redevelopment program, debt or preferred pay down and/or share repurchases opportunistically.

The financial metrics and strategic analysis suggest that the company should be approached with an 'underweight' investment stance. The decision to stay the course without exploring potentially larger opportunities may not maximize shareholder value in the long term. The company's reliance on embedding value and continued leasing and redevelopment may not be sufficient to drive growth in a challenging retail landscape. The potential impact of e-commerce retailers and the need for densification in the A-assets may present challenges in achieving desired growth and returns.
