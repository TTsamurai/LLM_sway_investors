In the recent earnings conference call transcript, GGP reported second quarter results that were in line with expectations. Key financial metrics include:

- Company FFO per diluted share for the second quarter was $0.35, consistent with guidance and consensus.
- Company NOI increased 1.3%, with growth of 3% when excluding the impact of bankruptcy.
- NOI weighted sales per square foot increased 1.7% to $705, demonstrating the quality of the portfolio.
- Total sales excluding apparel increased 3.1%, with NOI weighted sales without apparel at $906 per square foot.
- Lease spreads were up 10%, and up to 13% when measured by NOI weighted lease spreads.
- Lease spreads for new transactions or new leases were up over 18%.

The company also declared a $0.22 quarterly dividend, a 10% increase from last year. The A-rated centers within the portfolio, which drive a substantial amount of business, are expected to see NOI grow nearly 4% this year. NOI weighted sales per square foot for these assets increased 2.5% to $785.

Overall, the company is focused on maximizing shareholder value and is pursuing a strategy of continued growth and redevelopment of its portfolio. The company is also exploring opportunities for densification and mixed-use developments at its properties to create live/work/play environments.

Based on the financial metrics and strategic direction outlined in the conference call, I recommend an overweight investment stance in GGP. The company's focus on maximizing value through the quality of its retail portfolio, continued leasing and redevelopment efforts, and potential for future densification opportunities make it an attractive investment opportunity. I believe that GGP's strong financial metrics and strategic initiatives position it for long-term success and growth, making it an attractive option for an overweight allocation in a diversified investment portfolio.
