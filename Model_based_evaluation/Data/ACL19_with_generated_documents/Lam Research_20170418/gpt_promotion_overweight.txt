. Our company's financial and operational performance in the March quarter was exceptional and exceeded our expectations. We achieved record levels of shipments, revenue, gross margin, operating income, and earnings per share, all of which grew double digits quarter over quarter. Our memory segment, particularly NAND, continues to see strong demand driven by growth in enterprise and client SSDs and mobile device density increases. In addition, we are seeing an uptick in DRAM spending in line with improving demand from smartphones and servers. Our solid financial performance is a reflection of our strong position in the industry and the right investments we are making to sustain our business long term. Looking ahead, we are expecting another record quarter for the June quarter, with a forecasted shipment of $2.500 billion, record revenue of $2.300 billion, and a gross margin of 46%. We are confident in our continued strong financial and operational execution and are well positioned for long-term success. We recommend an 'overweight' investment stance based on our recent earnings call and our strong outlook for the future. Thank you.
