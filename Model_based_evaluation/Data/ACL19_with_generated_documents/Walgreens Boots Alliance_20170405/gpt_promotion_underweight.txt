Based on the recent earnings call for Walgreens Boots Alliance, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance due to several concerning factors. While the company reported a 14% increase in GAAP net earnings and a 15.3% increase in diluted EPS, adjusted operating income was down 4.9% and the adjusted gross margin was lower, primarily due to a decline in sales. The company's performance was somewhat impacted by currency exchange rates, as sales on a constant currency basis were only up 0.9%.

Additionally, the Retail Pharmacy USA division reported a decrease in comparable retail sales by 0.8% and adjusted operating margin was down by 0.5 percentage points. While the company experienced growth in U.S. pharmacy sales and market share, there were concerns about the impact of generics, reimbursement pressure, and the overall decline in sales for the division.

The international divisions also showed decreased sales and operating margins, with the pharmaceutical wholesale division reporting growth that was held back by challenging market conditions in Continental Europe.

Furthermore, while the company achieved its cost transformation program target ahead of plan, the additional pretax charges associated with the program were higher than anticipated. The company plans to close around 60 more stores, which will result in higher program costs.

In conclusion, the company's recent earnings call signals challenges in various divisions, with lower sales, operating margins, and increased costs. Therefore, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance based on these concerning factors.
