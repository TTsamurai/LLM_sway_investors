Based on the recent earnings call, Walgreens Boots Alliance has shown positive growth in several key areas, particularly in the U.S. pharmacy division, despite challenging market conditions. The company's financial highlights for the quarter include an increase in U.S. pharmacy total sales, growth in Medicare Part D and strategic pharmacy partnerships, and an increase in retail prescription market share. Additionally, the company has successfully achieved cost savings through its cost transformation program and announced a new share repurchase program.

The company's guidance for fiscal 2017 includes a maintained expectation for adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.90 to $5.08. The company has also secured regulatory clearance for the Rite Aid transaction and the new strategic alliance with Prime, providing potential opportunities for future growth.

Based on the performance and future growth prospects outlined in the earnings call, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Walgreens Boots Alliance. The company's continued progress in key divisions, successful cost savings program, and strategic partnerships position it for future success and potential for increased shareholder value.
