. So, direct selling can clearly have a relevant role not only for Younique but for all our business, because it gives us access to the consumer in a way that no other business model can do. So, to answer your question, it is relevant when we see it especially successful, like in the case of Younique. Thank you, Dara, for your question. We are indeed very pleased with the progress we have made in our merger integration. As I mentioned, we have completed the exit of our third and final TSA for the ALMEA region, which is an important milestone for us. The strong growth in our Luxury and Professional divisions is a testament to the success of the integration and our focus on driving synergies and efficiencies across the organization. We have also seen positive results from our strategic M&A activities, with acquisitions such as Hypermarcas and ghd driving strong performance in key markets. The relaunch of several key brands, such as COVERGIRL and Clairol, is also a clear demonstration of the progress we have made in repositioning select brands and driving improvements in market execution. The successful rollout of new products and innovations, such as Gucci Bloom and Color Crave, further underscores our commitment to driving growth and industry-leading margins over time. Additionally, our focus on building a diverse and inclusive culture, as well as our partnership with Global Citizen to fight prejudice and discrimination, reflects our commitment to celebrating and liberating the diversity of beauty. In summary, we are confident that our growth strategy is working and that Coty is on the path to becoming a new global leader and challenger in the beauty industry. Thank you for your question, Mark. Our long-term focus remains on achieving best-in-class sustainable operating margins. As I mentioned earlier, our investment thesis is based on the correlation between gross margin and EBIT across the beauty industry. We are committed to driving efficiencies and synergies across the organization to achieve our target operating margin of higher teens. We have already implemented a number of initiatives to deliver meaningful sustainable expense and cost management results as part of our signature program, and we expect these efforts to lead to healthy improvement in our adjusted operating income over time. Our continued focus on brand relaunches, innovation, and improved market execution, combined with our strategic M&A activities, such as the acquisitions of Younique and Burberry, reflects our commitment to driving growth and industry-leading margins over time. We are confident that the progress we have made in streamlining our brand portfolio, delivering on synergies, and building a diverse and inclusive culture will position Coty as a new global leader and challenger in the beauty industry. Thank you for your question, Jonathan. We are pleased with the performance of Younique and the impact it has had on our overall business.

We believe that direct selling can play a significant role in connecting with consumers and driving brand awareness, and we are confident in the potential of Younique to continue driving strong performance for Coty. Thank you for your question, Andrea. We are implementing a number of initiatives to drive sustainable expense and cost management results as part of our synergies program.
