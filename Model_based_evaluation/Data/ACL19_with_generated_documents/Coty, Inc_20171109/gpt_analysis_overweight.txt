. I'm confident that the company's growth strategy is moving in the direction of full recovery. Continued positive momentum in the luxury and professional divisions, as well as a stabilizing trend in the consumer beauty division, indicate that the company is on the path to sustainable growth. The successful innovation pipeline, new product launches, and strong in-store execution in the luxury division are driving double-digit growth in several countries. Additionally, the professional division is experiencing positive growth, particularly in the hair category.

Key insights from the earnings call transcript indicate that the company is focusing on repositioning select brands, accelerating innovation product development processes, digital transformation, and working closely with retailers to improve in-store execution. Initiatives to address challenges in North America and Europe, particularly in the consumer beauty division, include engaging with retailers to enhance the in-store shopping experience, accelerating time-to-market for on-trend collections, and driving e-commerce efforts.

The company's M&A strategy has contributed to positive results, with successful acquisitions such as Hypermarcas, ghd, and Younique driving growth in key markets and complementing the company's product portfolio. The recent acquisition of Burberry is expected to further accelerate the company's presence in the prestige color cosmetic category.

The focus on cost control and synergies from the P&G Beauty merger are expected to lead to a healthy improvement in adjusted operating income over time. The management team has implemented initiatives to deliver sustainable expense and cost management results, including strengthening cost control measures, consolidating commercial office facilities, and optimizing local operations.

Overall, the company's outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2018 is to deliver improved net revenue growth trends, finalize the streamlining of the brand portfolio, and re-launch several key brands. The company aims to achieve a healthy margin improvement over the balance of the year, with an organic second half top line roughly comparable to the previous year. The focus on strategic initiatives, brand repositioning, and digital transformation is expected to support the gradual improvement in consumer beauty revenue trends. The company remains confident in its strategy and is committed to achieving best-in-class sustainable operating margins.
