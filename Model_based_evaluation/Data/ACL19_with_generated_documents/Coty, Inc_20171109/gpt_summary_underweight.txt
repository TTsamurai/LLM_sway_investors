. Thank you for the transcript. Based on the key financial metrics and the explanations provided, it is clear that there are both positive and concerning trends in Coty's business. The company has shown strong growth in its Luxury and Professional divisions, with double-digit growth in several countries and success in new product launches. However, the Consumer Beauty division has experienced a decline in net revenue, driven by challenges in certain brands and weaknesses in the global mass beauty market.

The company has outlined a strategy to address these challenges, including actively engaging with retailer customers, accelerating time to market with on-trend collections and new products, driving e-commerce efforts, and focusing on accelerating the end-to-end digital transformation. Despite these efforts, it is acknowledged that it will take time for the full recovery of the Consumer Beauty division.

In terms of cost control, the company has implemented initiatives to deliver sustainable expense and cost management results, aiming for a healthy improvement in adjusted operating income over time. The management team has also emphasized the importance of achieving best-in-class sustainable operating margins in line with their investment thesis.

Overall, based on the details provided, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on Coty at this time. The positive performance in Luxury and Professional divisions is overshadowed by the challenges faced in the Consumer Beauty division, and the uncertainties regarding the full recovery timeline and the impact of ongoing cost control initiatives. Additional monitoring of the company's progress and financial performance is advised before considering a change in investment stance.
