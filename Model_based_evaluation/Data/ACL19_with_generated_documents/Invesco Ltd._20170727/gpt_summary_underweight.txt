Based on the earnings conference call transcript provided, it is recommended that an 'underweight' investment stance be adopted. Key financial metrics to consider include:

1. Total Assets Under Management (AUM): Quarter-over-quarter, the total AUM increased by $23.5 billion or 2.8%. This was driven by market gains and positive foreign exchange translation, but somewhat offset by long-term net outflows.

2. Net Revenue Yield: The net revenue yield increased to 42.7 basis points, excluding performance fees, representing a 0.9 basis point increase over the first quarter. However, the impact of a reduction in other revenue acted to decrease the yield by 0.2 basis points.

3. Net Revenues: Net revenues increased by $39.2 million or 4.5% quarter-over-quarter to $906.3 million. Adjusted investment management fees and adjusted services and distribution revenues also saw increases.

4. Operating Expenses: Adjusted operating expenses increased by $9.8 million or 1.8% relative to the first quarter. These increases were driven by factors such as marketing expenses, property, office, and technology expenses, and general and administrative expenses.

5. Adjusted Nonoperating Income: Decreased by $10 million compared to the first quarter, primarily due to the gain realized on pound sterling-U.S. dollar hedges.

6. Effective Tax Rate: The firmâ€™s effective tax rate on a pretax adjusted net income basis was 26.7%, resulting in an EPS of $0.64 and an adjusted operating margin of 39.3%.

Based on these financial metrics and the discussion on expenses and investments, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance, considering the increase in operating expenses and the potential impact on margins, along with the uncertainty surrounding performance fees and expenses related to regulatory and compliance requirements. Additionally, factors such as outflows in stable value and real estate passive investments may impact the net revenue yield. Therefore, it is prudent to approach investments in the company with caution.
