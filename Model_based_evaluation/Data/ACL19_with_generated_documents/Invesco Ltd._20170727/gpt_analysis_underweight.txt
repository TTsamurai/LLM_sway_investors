From the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is evident that the company has seen a quarter-over-quarter increase in total assets under management (AUM), driven by market gains, positive foreign exchange translation, and inflows into various investment capabilities. However, these factors were somewhat offset by long-term net outflows. The net revenue yield, excluding performance fees, also saw an increase driven by positive factors such as foreign exchange, changes in AUM mix, and an additional day, but was somewhat offset by a reduction in other revenue. 

Looking at the U.S. GAAP operating results, net revenues and adjusted investment management fees increased, reflecting higher average AUM as well as an additional day during the second quarter. Adjusted performance fees and other revenues saw both increases and decreases, driven by various factors. 

In terms of expenses, adjusted operating expenses increased, driven by various factors such as increased employee compensation, marketing expenses, property, office, and technology expenses, and general and administrative expenses. The firm's effective tax rate on a pretax adjusted net income basis was 26.7%, leading to an EPS of $0.64 and an adjusted operating margin of 39.3%.

In terms of the company's financial outlook, it is important to note that the company is making significant investments in its institutional business, solutions, ETFs, and digital advice capabilities. This investment is impacting the company's incremental margin and operating leverage, as well as its overall expense levels. The recent acquisition of Source assets is also expected to have a dilutive effect on the firm's net revenue yield. 

Based on these insights and financial metrics, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended for the company due to the impact of long-term net outflows, the dilutive effect of the recent acquisition, and the increasing expenses associated with the company's strategic investments. These factors may have a negative impact on the company's financial performance in the near term.
