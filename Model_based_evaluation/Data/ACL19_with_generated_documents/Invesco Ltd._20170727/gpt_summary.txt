Based on the provided insights from the earnings conference call, the key financial metrics for the company are as follows:
1. Total Assets Under Management (AUM): The company reported a quarter-over-quarter increase in total AUM of $23.5 billion, driven by market gains, positive foreign exchange translation, and inflows into money market capability and QQQs. However, long-term net outflows partially offset these gains, resulting in an average AUM of $849.2 billion for the second quarter.

2. Net Revenue Yield: The net revenue yield saw an increase to 42.7 basis points, with a further increase to 41.8 basis points when excluding performance fees. The positive impact of foreign exchange and change in AUM mix added to the yield, while a reduction in other revenue acted to decrease the yield.

3. Adjusted Net Revenues: The net revenues increased by $39.2 million or 4.5% quarter-over-quarter, reaching $906.3 million, mainly due to higher average AUM and a positive foreign exchange effect.

4. Operating Expenses: Adjusted operating expenses increased by $9.8 million or 1.8% relative to the first quarter, driven by higher outsourced administration and software costs. Marketing expenses also increased by 18.8% quarter-over-quarter.

5. Adjusted Non-Operating Income and Taxes: The company noted a decrease in adjusted non-operating income by $10 million compared to the first quarter. The effective tax rate on a pretax adjusted net income basis was 26.7%, resulting in an EPS of $0.64 and an adjusted operating margin of 39.3%.

6. Investments and Acquisitions: The company emphasized its focus on making organic and inorganic investments to serve as key business differentiators for long-term success. This includes ongoing investments in building out institutional business, solutions, ETFs, and digital advice capabilities.

7. Synergies and Growth: The company highlighted its growth strategy, indicating that the benefit from its recent acquisition is projected to be primarily through growing flows rather than cost take-out.

These key financial metrics provide insights into the company's AUM growth, net revenue yield, and expense management, as well as its strategic focus on investments and acquisitions for long-term growth. The company also provided guidance on future revenue, expenses, and market dynamics, indicating a proactive approach to navigating industry challenges and capitalizing on growth opportunities.
