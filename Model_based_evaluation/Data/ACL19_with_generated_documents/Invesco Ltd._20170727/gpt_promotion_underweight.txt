Based on the recent earnings call, the company's total assets under management (AUM) saw a quarter-over-quarter increase, driven by market gains, positive foreign exchange translation, and inflows into money market capability. However, long-term net outflows and a reduction in other revenue acted as offsets to the overall increase in AUM. The net revenue yield also increased, primarily due to factors such as foreign exchange impact and a change in AUM mix. 

When it comes to expenses, the firm saw an increase in adjusted operating expenses, particularly in marketing, property, office, and technology expenses. Additionally, the firm's effective tax rate and adjusted non-operating income were mentioned, with the company's EPS at $0.64 and adjusted operating margin at 39.3%.

The company also discussed its investments in building out its institutional business, solutions, ETFs, Jemstep, and resources for regulatory and compliance requirements on a global basis. The firm's capital policy and approach remain in place, with a focus on cost optimization efforts in order to remain as efficient as possible and fund necessary investments. 

Additionally, the company commented on regulatory changes, particularly in Europe and on the topic of research commissions using Client Service Agreements (CSAs) to fund Research Payment Accounts (RPAs). 

Overall, the company expressed optimism about its institutional business and addressed the impact of the Source acquisition on its revenue and expenses, as well as its position on potential inorganic opportunities for growth. The company mentioned that it expects a structural change in the incremental margins, particularly related to the investments and costs associated with building out key capabilities. 

Given these factors and the uncertainty around regulatory changes and market dynamics, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company until there is further clarity on its ability to effectively manage expenses and generate sustainable revenue growth. This cautious perspective is based on the potential challenges and uncertainties highlighted in the earnings call that may impact the company's financial performance in the near term.
