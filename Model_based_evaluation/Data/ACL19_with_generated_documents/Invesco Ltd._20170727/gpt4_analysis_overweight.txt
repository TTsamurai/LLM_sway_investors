### Future Outlook Report: Overweight Investment Stance on Invesco

#### Executive Summary
Invesco exhibited a robust financial performance in Q2 2017, evidenced by substantial growth in assets under management (AUM), increased net revenue yields, and effective management of operating expenses. However, the company has faced pressure from net outflows in certain asset categories and is navigating regulatory changes and market uncertainties. Despite these challenges, Invesco’s strong global presence, expanding product portfolio, strategic acquisitions, and ongoing investments in technology and infrastructure position it favorably for sustained growth. Consequently, we recommend an 'overweight' investment stance.

#### AUM and Revenue Performance
Invesco's total AUM increased by $23.5 billion, a 2.8% quarter-over-quarter growth, ending the quarter at $849.2 billion. This growth was driven by market gains and positive foreign exchange impacts, alongside inflows into money markets and QQQs, though offset by long-term net outflows of $0.6 billion.

Net revenues rose by 4.5% to $906.3 million, bolstered by higher AUM and positive foreign exchange movements. Investment management fees increased by 5.6% to $1.03 billion, reflecting higher average AUM. The net revenue yield improved by 0.9 basis points to 42.7 basis points; however, adjusted to exclude performance fees, the yield saw a modest increase.

#### Expense Management and Margins
Invesco's adjusted operating expenses increased by 1.8%, with particular increments in marketing, technology, and compliance-related costs due to strategic investments. Despite higher expenses, the adjusted operating margin remained healthy at 39.3%. The firm expects to manage future costs effectively, with some eventual savings anticipated from completion of ongoing large-scale projects.

#### Strategic Initiatives and Growth Prospects
Invesco's acquisition of Source is expected to dilute net revenue yield initially, but it positions the company strongly in the ETF market, broadens its product offerings, and potentially accelerates growth through enhanced distribution channels. The firm is also investing in expanding its institutional presence and digital capabilities, ensuring competitiveness and meeting evolving client needs.

#### Risks and Mitigation
Regulatory changes, particularly regarding commissions on research following MiFID II, and global economic uncertainties pose risks. However, Invesco's proactive management strategies, including maintaining robust compliance and risk management frameworks, should mitigate these risks effectively. Additionally, the focus on high-margin products and regions such as Europe, where business remains strong, should bolster profitability.

#### Market and Competitive Position
Invesco’s diversified product mix and global footprint provide resilience against market volatility and competitive pressures. Its investment in technology and new product development, such as smart-beta ETFs and digital advisory platforms, align with industry trends and consumer demands, enhancing its market position.

#### Investment Thesis
Based on Invesco’s strategic positioning, robust balance sheet, and ability to navigate market complexities, we envisage a positive trajectory for the company. Invesco’s initiatives to expand its institutional business, along with investments in solutions, ETFs, and technology, support an optimistic revenue and earnings outlook. The pace of strategic investments and cost optimization efforts indicates potential for margin improvement post-2018.

#### Recommendation
Given these factors, the recommendation is to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance on Invesco, projecting that the stock will outperform the broader market based on its growth prospects, strategic initiatives, and robust financial health.
