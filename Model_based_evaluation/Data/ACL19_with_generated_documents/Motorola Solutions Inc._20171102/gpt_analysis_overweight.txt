Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is clear that the company has demonstrated strong performance in the third quarter. The revenue of $1.6 billion is up 7% versus last year, and the organic revenue was up 5%. The GAAP operating earnings were slightly down from last year, but the non-GAAP operating earnings showed a 7% increase. Additionally, the backlog has seen significant growth, with the ending backlog at $8.9 billion, up $768 million from last year.

The Products segment has shown significant growth, with product sales up 8% from last year, and the segment operating income increasing to 29% of sales. The Services segment also showed strong performance, with services revenue up 7% from last year. The company has also announced an increase in their quarterly dividend by 11%, which shows confidence in their financial position.

Looking at the future outlook, the company is raising their Q4 and full-year guidance, expecting Q4 revenue growth of approximately 3% with non-GAAP EPS between $2 and $2.05. The full-year 2017 revenue growth is expected to be approximately 5% and non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $5.35 to $5.40. The company also expects full-year operating expenses to be down approximately $15 million from 2016, and the effective tax rate to be approximately 32%.

Based on these insights, it is evident that the company is in a strong financial position and is expected to continue on a growth trajectory. As a financial analyst, I would recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company, as they have demonstrated strong financial performance and have a positive outlook for the future.
