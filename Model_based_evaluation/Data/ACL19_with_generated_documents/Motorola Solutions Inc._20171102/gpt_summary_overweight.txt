Based on the Q3 earnings conference call transcript, the key financial metrics point to a strong performance by the company. Revenue was up 7% versus last year, driven by both organic growth and revenue from acquisitions. Additionally, GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share showed double-digit increases, demonstrating strong profitability.

The Product segment saw impressive growth, with product sales up 8% from last year. The segment's backlog also showed strong growth, increasing by 24% compared to the prior year. This growth was primarily driven by strong demand in North America for P25 systems.

Services revenue was up 7% from last year, with Managed & Support services revenue growing by 8%. While Services operating income decreased from the prior year, gross margins returned to expected levels. The Services backlog also showed solid growth, up 6% compared to the prior year.

Operating expenses increased slightly, primarily due to acquisitions, but overall, the company managed to maintain a strong operating margin of 25.7% of sales.

Cash flow from operations decreased slightly from last year, primarily due to higher working capital associated with an ERP implementation and higher tax payments. However, the company still expects approximately $1.2 billion in operating cash flow for 2017.

The company also announced an increase in its quarterly dividend and raised its Q4 and full-year guidance, reflecting confidence in its future performance.

From a regional perspective, strong demand in North America and EMEA drove revenue growth, particularly in the Products segment. The company also secured several notable deals, further demonstrating the strength of its product and service offerings.

In conclusion, the company's Q3 results demonstrate its strong financial performance and growth prospects. Based on these metrics and guidance, adopting an 'overweight' investment stance on the stock seems justified. The company's solid revenue growth, strong backlog, and strategic acquisitions indicate a positive outlook for future earnings and shareholder returns.
