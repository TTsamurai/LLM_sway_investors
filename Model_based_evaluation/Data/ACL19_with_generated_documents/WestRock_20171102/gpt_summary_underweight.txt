As a financial analyst, after analyzing the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on WestRock. This recommendation is based on the following financial metrics:

1. Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS): The adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.87 and $2.62 for the full fiscal year. While these figures show some growth, they are not significant enough to warrant an overweight investment stance.

2. Free Cash Flow: The fiscal 2017 adjusted free cash flow exceeded the $1.2 billion target, indicating strong cash flow generation. However, it is essential to look at the broader financial metrics before making an investment decision.

3. Sales Growth: Sales grew by 12% over the prior year quarter, with $495 million from acquisitions and $175 million in pricing gains. The impact of the sale of the dispensing business was also highlighted. While the sales growth is positive, it is important to note that it was partially offset by lower volume.

4. EBITDA Margins: Total company adjusted EBITDA margins were stable at 16.1% year-over-year. This is an impressive figure considering the inflation and negative impact of hurricanes. However, the stability alone may not justify a significant investment.

5. Cost Inflation and Productivity: The company experienced $162 million in inflation in the quarter and incurred $27 million negative impact from hurricanes. Productivity was an important contributor to earnings, with $80 million realized in the quarter and $361 million for the full year. While productivity is commendable, the cost inflation should be carefully considered.

6. Acquisitions and Investment: The company made five acquisitions for a total enterprise value of approximately $2.65 billion and sold the dispensing business for net proceeds of over $1 billion. The net investment of $1.65 billion is expected to increase future adjusted EBITDA by $300 million. The effective EBITDA multiple for acquisitions during fiscal 2017 was 5.5 times. These figures indicate significant investment activity, which may pose some risk for investors.

Considering the above financial metrics and the company's operational updates, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on WestRock. It is important to carefully weigh the potential risks and returns before making any investment decisions.
