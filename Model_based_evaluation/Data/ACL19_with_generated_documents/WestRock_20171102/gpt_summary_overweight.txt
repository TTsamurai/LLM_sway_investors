As a financial analyst adopting an 'overweight' investment stance, here is the detailed summary report on the recent earnings conference call transcript:

WestRock has shown outstanding progress in their second full fiscal year, with adjusted earnings per share at $0.87 in the latest quarter and $2.62 for the full year. They have surpassed their target for adjusted free cash flow and have delivered significant productivity gains. The company's strategy of combining product and service offerings to address customer needs has resulted in the closing of new business from key accounts, with an incremental annual run rate of over $200 million. The company also received recognition for outstanding performance in sales and design.

WestRock's acquisitions have been successful and have increased their focus on paper and packaging, with an effective EBITDA multiple for acquisitions during fiscal 2017 at 5.5 times. The company's strong cash flows and long-term outlook have led to a 7.5% increase in the annual dividend, demonstrating their commitment to increasing earnings and cash flow for investors.

In terms of financial metrics, WestRock reported sales of over $4 billion, a 12% increase over the prior year quarter. Their sales increase was driven by acquisitions and pricing gains, partially offset by lower volume and the impact of the sale of the dispensing business. The company's adjusted EBITDA margins remained stable year-over-year at 16.1%, despite inflation and the negative impact of hurricanes. Productivity was a significant contributor to earnings, with $80 million realized in the quarter and $361 million for the full year.

In the Corrugated Packaging segment, WestRock's North American daily box shipments increased, with an improved integration rate and strong domestic box demand. The company also saw growth in international markets, particularly in Mexico and Brazil. However, hurricanes and increased recycled fiber costs had an impact on the segment's results.

The Consumer Packaging segment reported improved sales and adjusted EBITDA, with strength in certain end markets and the successful integration of acquisitions. The Multi Packaging Solutions business also performed well, with the integration of run rate synergies and performance improvements on track.

In conclusion, WestRock's solid performance, successful acquisitions, and focus on productivity and integration position the company for significant growth in sales, earnings, and cash flow in fiscal 2018. The company's capital allocation framework and reinvestment of cash flow indicate their commitment to generating strong returns and long-term value for investors. The upcoming Financial Analyst and Investor Day in New York City presents an opportunity for further insights into the company's strategic plan and growth opportunities.

Overall, the financial metrics and strategic initiatives of WestRock support an 'overweight' investment stance, as the company's solid performance and growth prospects make it an attractive investment opportunity.
