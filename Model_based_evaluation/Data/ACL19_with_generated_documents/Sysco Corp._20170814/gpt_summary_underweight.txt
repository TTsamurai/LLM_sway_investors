. Hello and good morning everyone. After analyzing the recent earnings conference call transcript for Sysco, I am taking an 'underweight' investment stance based on the following key financial metrics.

1. Revenue Growth: Although Sysco reported a sales growth of 1.5% in its U.S. Foodservice Operations, this was partially offset by declines in case volume for the multi-unit business. With only a 1% total case growth overall, it signals a potential slowdown in revenue growth.

2. Gross Profit Margin: While the company did achieve gross profit growth of 4% and gross margin expansion of 48 basis points in the U.S. Foodservice Operations, it is noted that they are now working through an inflationary environment, particularly in poultry, produce, seafood, and dairy. This may impact gross profit margins in the future.

3. Operating Expenses: Sysco reported a 1.7% growth in adjusted operating expenses in the U.S. Foodservice Operations. Although the company has limited the growth of expenses, any further increases could impact profitability.

4. International Expansion: While the acquisition of the Brakes business in Europe led to nearly doubled sales and adjusted operating income, the challenging environment in the UK and ongoing transition activities in Ireland may pose risks to the company's international operations.

5. Customer Loyalty: Sysco's focus on providing value for local customers and improving customer loyalty scores is a positive indicator. However, with some decline in the contract business and ongoing competitive market dynamics, this aspect requires close monitoring.

Given the aforementioned financial metrics and the potential risks in both the domestic and international segments, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance for Sysco. The company's operating expenses, inflationary environment, and potential challenges in international markets warrant a cautious approach to investment. Thank you.
