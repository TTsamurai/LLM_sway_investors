, which is reflected in our growth in local customers for the 13th quarter in a row. From a financial perspective, our gross profit growth for U.S. Foodservice Operations was strong at 4%, with gross margin expanding by 48 basis points. We effectively managed our expenses, limiting growth to 1.7% on an adjusted basis. Our U.S. Broadline costs per case improved by approximately $0.01 compared to the prior year, and on a fuel price neutral basis, cost per case increased by one penny. This consistent performance is driven by key strategic initiatives, supported by our dedicated front-line associates in the warehouse and delivery teams. As a result, we were able to improve our adjusted operating margins by 45 basis points for the full year, demonstrating our strong operational performance.

In our International Foodservice Operations, sales and adjusted operating income nearly doubled on a comparable 52-week basis, largely due to the acquisition of the Brakes Group. Brakes exceeded our expectations for EPS accretion, contributing $0.14 per share, and is making good progress in supply chain transformation efforts. We see long-term opportunities for growth across our European business, and we are excited about the potential to create value for our customers in this market.

In Canada, despite the softness in Alberta driven by the energy market decline, we have seen positive momentum in the growth of our local business. We are effectively managing costs and expect continued positive performance in the Canadian business.

In Latin America, we are excited about the new facilities in Costa Rica and Panama, which will enable accelerated growth potential for our offerings. Looking forward to fiscal 2018, we are confident in our strong momentum and remain focused on delivering value for our customers through innovative products and consultative services. We will continue to manage the transition to an inflationary environment, drive efficiency from our supply chain, and focus on delivering growth with our local customers.

Overall, Sysco's fiscal 2017 showed important progress against our customer-centric strategy, and our financial performance reflects our solid execution of key strategic initiatives. We believe that Sysco is well-positioned for the future and are excited about the opportunities ahead.
