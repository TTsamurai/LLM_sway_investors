 and delivering results. In terms of our cost management, we have been successful in limiting growth to 1.7% on an adjusted 52-week comparable basis for the year. We have also seen improvement in our cost-per-case, with a decrease of $0.01 compared to the prior year. We have been able to achieve consistent performance driven by key strategic initiatives and a dedicated front line team. Overall, our U.S. foodservice operations have performed well, with adjusted operating income improving and adjusted operating margins expanding by 45 basis points for the full year.

Moving on to our international foodservice operations, we have seen significant growth, with sales and adjusted operating income nearly doubling on a 52-week comparable basis, mainly driven by our acquisition of the Brakes Group. Despite challenges in the UK market, Brakes has exceeded our expectations and contributed $0.14 per share to EPS accretion. We have also made progress in supply chain transformation efforts in the UK, and have seen steady growth in France and favorable results in Sweden. We are excited about the long-term opportunities for growth in our European business and will continue to invest in building on the existing foundation of the business.

In Canada, despite the softness in Alberta driven by the energy market decline, we have seen positive momentum in the growth of our local business, driven by improved sales execution and customer-focused initiatives. We have also been successful in managing costs by streamlining administrative expenses to improve productivity, and expect our Canadian business to continue delivering positive performance.

In Latin America, we have opened new facilities in Costa Rica and Panama, which will enable us to offer new products and full product lines to our customers, driving accelerated growth potential. Overall, we are excited about the long-term opportunities to create value for our customers in our international business, and will continue to focus on key strategic initiatives to position us for future growth.

As we move into fiscal 2018, we remain focused on delivering value for our customers and effectively managing the transition to an inflationary environment. Our ongoing focus on customer insights, innovative products, and consultative services will enable our sales force to continue adding significant value and driving growth with local customers.

In conclusion, fiscal 2017 has shown important progress against our customer-centric strategy. Our customer and operational strategies are aligned to improve customer experience and engage our associates to improve execution, delivering on our financial objectives. We are excited about the future of Sysco and remain confident in our ability to drive sustainable growth and create value for our customers. Thank you.
