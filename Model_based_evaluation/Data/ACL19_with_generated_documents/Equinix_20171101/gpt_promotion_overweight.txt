. Steve's overview. I want to highlight a few key points from today's earnings call that demonstrate why Equinix is a compelling investment opportunity.

1. Rapid growth and strong performance: Equinix reported strong third quarter results, with revenues of $1.152 billion, up 10% from the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $550 million, up 10% over the same quarter last year, and AFFO growth was 16% year-over-year. These growth rates demonstrate Equinix's strong operating performance.

2. Interconnection strength: Interconnection revenues grew 17% year-over-year, outpacing colocation revenues and reflecting the success of Equinix's interconnection and ecosystem centric strategy.

3. Geographic reach and acquisitions: Equinix's global footprint now extends to 190 data centers across 48 markets, comprising over 19 million gross square feet of capacity. Equinix closed two new transactions in EMEA, expanding its footprint in Spain, Portugal, and Turkey.

4. Industry verticals: Equinix saw strong growth and new wins across all industry verticals, including networks, financial services, content and digital media, cloud and IT services, and enterprise.

5. Channel partnerships: Equinix's focused channel efforts are paying off, with 19% of bookings originating from the channel this quarter. Partners are building value-added services around Equinix's core offerings, enhancing the company's market reach and scalability.

Based on the company's strong performance, rapid growth, and strategic acquisitions, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Equinix. The company's leadership in interconnection and ecosystem centric strategy positions it well for continued success in the evolving digital business landscape.
