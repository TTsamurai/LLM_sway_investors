Based on the presented information from the conference call transcript, I would adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on Equinix. Despite the positive outlook presented by the company's CEO and President, Steve Smith, there are several key financial metrics that are cause for concern.

1. Revenue Growth: While Equinix reported a 10% year-over-year increase in revenues for the third quarter, the growth rate has slowed down compared to previous quarters. This slowdown in revenue growth could indicate potential challenges in capturing the shift to the cloud and winning new customers.

2. EBITDA and AFFO Growth: The 10% year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA and 16% growth in AFFO are positive indicators of strong operating performance. However, it's important to note that these growth rates are on a normalized and constant currency basis, which may not accurately reflect the company's actual financial performance.

3. Interconnection Revenues: While interconnection revenues grew 17% year-over-year, it's concerning that this growth is outpacing colocation revenues. This imbalance could potentially impact the company's overall revenue stream and profitability.

4. Geographic Expansion: Equinix's recent acquisitions in EMEA and Turkey indicate a focus on expanding its global footprint. However, it's important to assess the potential risks and challenges associated with integrating these new assets into the company's existing operations.

5. Federal Business and Verizon Assets: The company's progress in the federal business and integration of the Verizon assets is highlighted as positive. However, further due diligence is required to assess the long-term impact of these initiatives on the company's financial performance.

6. Channel Efforts and Partner Services: Equinix's focus on developing its channel and partner services is a positive strategy. However, it's essential to evaluate the potential impact of these efforts on the company's revenue growth and market share.

In conclusion, while Equinix's business is performing well in certain areas, the detailed financial metrics suggest potential challenges and uncertainties. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended until further analysis and evaluation of the company's financial performance and growth prospects.
