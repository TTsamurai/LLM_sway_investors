The financial metrics that should be included in the detailed summary report are the company's progress on its strategic and financial goals, the impact of recent hurricanes on the business, updates on the construction program and milestones, the company's portfolio reshaping and returns on recent investments, cost-cutting and revenue-enhancement initiatives, updates on asset sales program, and the overall financial outlook and guidance. These metrics will help provide a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance and outlook, supporting an 'overweight' investment stance.
