### Summary Report: Hematology & Oncology Franchise Earnings Conference Call - Adopting Underweight Stance

#### Key Financial Metrics Analysis

#### General Overview
- The Hematology & Oncology franchise reported solid performance for the third quarter, citing a 10% year-over-year revenue growth.
- Significant progress made in pipeline development, particularly regarding both current and future drug trials and regulatory approvals.

#### Product-Specific Analysis:
1. **REVLIMID**
   - Reported a 10% year-over-year growth in sales, with an 18% increase in U.S. sales mainly fueled by increased market share and patient treatment duration.
   - International sales saw a 2% decline year-over-year due to a prior year's higher base affected by a large Russian tender and clinical trial purchases.
   - Despite the increase in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma market share and treatment duration, volatility in international sales could pose risks to sustained growth.

2. **POMALYST/IMNOVID**
   - Continued robust performance with a 22% growth year-over-year. In the U.S., sales were up by 32%.
   - The drug seems robust against the entry of new competitors in its segment, although international growth was a moderate 8%.

3. **ABRAXANE**
   - Overall, sales grew 8% year-over-year and maintained stable market share in its key indications.
   - Notably smaller growth rates in the U.S. (3% increase) as compared to international markets (15% increase).
   - This drug continues to face substantial competition in both existing and emerging markets which could limit growth potential.

#### Pipeline and Future Prospects Review
- **CAR-T Cell Therapies**: bb2121 and JCAR017 show promise as transformational assets in relapsed/refractory myeloma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma respectively. Long-term data and further trials will be crucial to establish their efficacy and market positioning.
- **Significant Pipeline Development**: Collaboration on BGB-A317, advancements in luspatercept programs, and progression of new studies like the luspatercept Phase 3 study in MDS. The potential market impact of these products will depend on successful trial outcomes and timely regulatory approvals.
- **Near-term Phase 3 Data Readouts**: Expected for key products which might determine the potential for market expansion or entry into new therapeutic areas.

#### Investment Stance: Underweight
- **Reasons for Underweight Stance**:
  - Despite strong Q3 performance in some key products, there are underlying concerns about the sustainability of growth, particularly with international volatility observed in REVLIMID sales.
  - Competitive pressures across several key products are increasing, with numerous similar therapies entering the market which could dilute market share.
  - Incremental sales growth in established drugs like ABRAXANE appears to be slowing down, particularly in critical markets such as the U.S.
  - While pipeline developments hold promise, the actual contribution to financials will hinge on successful commercialization and ability to displace established therapies.

#### Recommendations for Future Strategy:
- Monitor forthcoming trial results closely to assess the potential impact on the portfolio.
- Enhance strategic marketing and competitive differentiation particularly in international markets where volatility and competition may impede growth.
- Consider strategic alliances or acquisitions to bolster the current pipeline and access novel technologies, particularly in areas of unmet medical need.

#### Conclusion:
The Hematology & Oncology franchise is positioned in a challenging competitive landscape, with solid historical growth but facing potential hurdles in sustained growth due to market and competitive dynamics. An underweight investment stance is recommended until clearer signs of strategic execution and competitive dominance are evident.
