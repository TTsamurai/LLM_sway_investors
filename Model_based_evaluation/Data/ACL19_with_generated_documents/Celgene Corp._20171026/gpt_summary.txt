 of assets. And so any combination with next-generation CELMoD, with BCMA targeted therapies, with CAR-T, with other modalities would be in our consideration set. So I think that's what's exciting about the near-term data readouts with our Phase 3 programs, but also in terms of the longer-term potential that we see with our pipeline assets and how they can be combined to provide even greater benefit to patients in multiple myeloma and other hematological malignancies. I hope that answers your question. Thank you.
