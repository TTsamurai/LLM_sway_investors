**Summary:**
The Hematology & Oncology franchise has reported a strong performance in the third quarter with a notable year-over-year revenue growth of 10%. The following analysis delves deep into the financial metrics and strategic developments discussed in the recent earnings call, underpinning our overweight investment recommendation.

**Key Financial Metrics:**
1. **Revenue Growth:**
   - **REVLIMID**: Demonstrated a robust 10% year-over-year growth, driven largely by increased market share and duration of treatment in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. Despite some international volatility, underlying growth remains solid.
   - **POMALYST/IMNOVID**: Achieved a remarkable 22% year-over-year growth, with significant contributions from new approvals in combination therapies.
   - **ABRAXANE**: Reported an 8% increase in year-over-year sales, supported by stable demand and market share gains in metastatic pancreatic cancer.

2. **Market Expansion and Geographical Reach:**
   - REVLIMID now sees reimbursement in multiple countries, including a recent approval in France, which is expected to drive further international volume.
   - POMALYST/IMNOVID has shown stable international growth despite new market entrants, indicating strong brand resilience.

3. **Pipeline and New Products:**
   - **CAR-T Programs**: Collaborations on bb2121 BCMA CAR-T and JCAR017 CAR-T show significant progress, with pivotal trials planned or ongoing. These are critical for growth in relapsed/refractory patient populations.
   - **Luspatercept**: Advancements in Phase 3 studies for both MDS and beta-thalassemia are expected to report in mid-2018, potentially opening new treatment paradigms.
   - **Marizomib**: A pivotal Phase 3 study in front-line glioblastoma slated to begin next year could provide a breakthrough in treatment.

**Strategic Developments:**
- Closed collaboration deal with BeiGene for BGB-A317, enhancing clinical development strategies to maximize the asset's potential.
- Significant progress in next-generation treatments with the submission of IND for CC-92480 for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

**Future Outlook:**
The franchise is well-positioned for sustained growth with multiple Phase 3 data readouts anticipated in the coming months in key disease areas like lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and pancreatic cancer. The ongoing and upcoming trials underscore a robust pipeline poised to cater to unmet medical needs, particularly in the relapsed/refractory space.

**Investment Consideration:**
Given the solid earnings performance, continuous growth in key products, promising pipeline advancements, and strategic collaborations, the Hematology & Oncology franchise represents a strong investment opportunity. We recommend an overweight stance, anticipating above-market returns driven by both existing products and future market expansions. This analysis aligns with expected near-term catalysts and significant long-term potential, reaffirming our positive outlook on the franchiseâ€™s capabilities to deliver substantial shareholder value.
