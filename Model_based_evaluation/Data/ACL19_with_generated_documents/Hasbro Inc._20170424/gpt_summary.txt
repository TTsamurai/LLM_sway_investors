The financial analyst report should focus on key financial metrics and the impact of the recent earnings conference call transcripts. Key metrics to focus on for the report would include revenue growth, earnings per share, operating profit, net earnings, costs and expenses, and cash flow. 

The report would highlight that revenue increased by 2% and earnings per share increased by 40% during the first quarter. Despite this growth, operating profit decreased by 9%, largely due to anticipated events such as an extra week of expenses and a shift in product mix. The report would also note that net earnings increased to $68.6 million, and the company continues to be in a strong financial position with positive consumer engagement and a healthy balance sheet.

The report would also cover the breakdown of revenue growth by segment, including U.S. and Canada, international, and entertainment and licensing. It would note the positive impact from foreign exchange on international segment revenues and the increase in digital gaming revenues in the entertainment and licensing segment.

Furthermore, the report would analyze the impact of costs and expenses on the company's financial performance. This would include a detailed breakdown of cost of sales, royalties, product development, and selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues. The report would also cover the impact of the extra week on expenses and the higher interest income due to rising rates.

Additionally, the report would discuss cash flow and capital priorities, including operating cash flow of $411.9 million and a healthy balance sheet with $1.5 billion in cash. The report would also highlight the return of $81.5 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchase programs, as well as the decrease in inventories by 10% in the quarter.

In conclusion, the report would emphasize that despite the challenges in the first quarter, the company is well-positioned for 2017 with strong consumer engagement, investments for long-term growth, and new entertainment and innovations slated throughout the year. It would also address the impact of stock price appreciation on tax benefits and the company's strategies to mitigate the effects of the 14-week period on financial performance.
