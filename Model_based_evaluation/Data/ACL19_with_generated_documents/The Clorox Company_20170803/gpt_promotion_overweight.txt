 for your comprehensive overview of the recent earnings call. Based on the information provided, I am confident in recommending an 'overweight' investment stance on The Clorox Company. The company's fourth quarter results were impressive, with total company volume and sales growing across all segments. 

In the Cleaning segment, there was strong growth in Home Care, particularly driven by record shipments of Clorox disinfecting wipes and new Scentiva wipes and sprays. The Home Care business delivered a third consecutive year of strong market share growth, reaching its highest share in six years. Additionally, the Professional Products business saw volume growth, and there were continued innovations in the surface disinfecting space.

The Household segment also performed well, with strong topline growth in Renew Life, Cat Litter, and Glad. Renew Life saw distribution expansion and strong growth in e-Commerce, while Glad's premium OdorShield trash bags performed well, offsetting declines in the base business. Lastly, in the Lifestyle segment, Burt's Bees delivered solid topline growth, and the Food business, although volume declined slightly, maintained healthy consumption and shares in key segments.

Despite FX headwinds and slower category growth in certain international markets, International volume and sales were up in the fourth quarter. The company's efforts to take pricing to offset unfavorable foreign exchange demonstrate a commitment to improving margins.

Overall, the company's strong performance across segments and its focus on innovation and distribution expansion positions it well for fiscal year 2018. Considering these factors, an 'overweight' investment stance on The Clorox Company is warranted.
