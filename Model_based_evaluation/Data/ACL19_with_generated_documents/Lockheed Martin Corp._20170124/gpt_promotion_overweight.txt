Based on the recent earnings call from Lockheed Martin, I am recommending an 'overweight' investment stance in the company. The company's financial performance in 2016 exceeded all expectations, with sales, earnings per share, and cash from operations reaching historical high watermarks. The company's backlog grew to over $96 billion, demonstrating strong demand for their products from both domestic and international customers. Additionally, the company's strong and growing backlog is expected to deliver expanding sales levels and outstanding financial results in the future.

The company's commitment to cash deployment strategy resulted in returning 100% of their free cash flow to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. Their strong cash generation of nearly $5.2 billion in 2016 reflects their dedication to executing contracts for customers on a daily basis.

In terms of future growth opportunities, Lockheed Martin's broad portfolio and the growth opportunities it provides both domestically and internationally position the company for continued success. The company is well-positioned for long-term success, especially with the inclusion of Sikorsky in their portfolio, opening up opportunities for helicopter programs and continued growth.

Additionally, the company's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program has shown increasing international demand, and the company is focused on driving the cost of the aircraft down to provide unmatched capabilities at affordable prices for their customers and taxpayers. The company's focus on innovation and investment in research and development make them a leader in the industry.

Furthermore, there is bipartisan support for eliminating sequestration, which could lead to an increase in defense spending, benefiting Lockheed Martin's position as a major defense contractor.

Overall, the company's exceptional performance in 2016, strong backlog, commitment to cash deployment, broad portfolio, and opportunities for future growth make Lockheed Martin a compelling investment opportunity.
