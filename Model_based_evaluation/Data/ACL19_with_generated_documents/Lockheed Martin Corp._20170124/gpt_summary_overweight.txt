Based on the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, the key financial metrics indicate strong performance and positive outlook for Lockheed Martin Corporation. The company exceeded all of its full year financial metrics, including sales, earnings per share, and cash from operations, which all exceeded historical high watermarks. The company also achieved a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4 and ended the year with a backlog of over $96 billion, indicating strong demand for its products from both domestic and international customers. In addition, the company generated almost $5.2 billion in cash from operations in 2016, exceeding its initial three-year $15 billion commitment by $1 billion. This strong cash generation enabled the company to return 100% of its free cash flow to stockholders through competitive dividends and ongoing share repurchase activities. Moreover, the company's F-35 program demonstrated significant achievements, with increasing international interest and a trajectory towards lower per unit prices, showcasing efficient production and cost reduction efforts. The company also highlighted its success in other business areas, such as space systems and helicopter production. Considering the positive financial performance and growth opportunities, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance for Lockheed Martin Corporation. The strong financial metrics, robust backlog, and successful programs indicate a promising outlook for future growth and value creation for stockholders.
