### Future Outlook Report: Lockheed Martin Corporation

**Investment Stance: Overweight**

#### Executive Summary
Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMC) has demonstrated robust financial and operational performance in 2016, surpassing its financial goals and setting a strong foundation for future growth. The evidence from the latest earnings call highlights that LMC is likely to sustain its growth trajectory into 2017 and beyond, backed by a significant increase in backlogs, lucrative new contracts, and governmental support reflected in defense appropriations. As a result, LMC presents an overweight investment recommendation given its strategic positioning and operational readiness to capitalize on expanding defense needs globally.

   - The 2017 National Defense Authorization Act suggests bipartisan support for defense budgets beyond sequestration levels, encouraging higher appropriations for defense spending.

#### Risk Factors and Considerations

- **Dependence on Government Contracts:** LMC's revenue is heavily reliant on U.S. government defense contracts, making it susceptible to changes in federal defense spending.
- **Geo-political Factors:** Changes in U.S. defense policies or international relations could impact both domestic and foreign contracts.

The company's adaptation to policy changes and proactive management of costs and operational efficiencies further bolster the investment outlook.
