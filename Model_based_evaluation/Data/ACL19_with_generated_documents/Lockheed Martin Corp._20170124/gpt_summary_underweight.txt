Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript from Lockheed Martin, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for the company. Here are some key financial metrics from the call to support this recommendation:

1. Sales and Backlog: The company reported exceptional sales performance in 2016, with a year-end backlog of over $96 billion. While this reflects strong demand for the company's products, it also indicates a high level of dependency on a few large contracts, which may pose a risk in case of any contract cancellations or delays.

2. Cash Generation and Deployment: Lockheed Martin achieved strong cash generation of nearly $5.2 billion in 2016 and returned 100% of its free cash flow to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. This indicates a lack of significant reinvestment in the business for future growth and innovation.

3. F-35 Program: While the F-35 program has shown positive progress in terms of cost reduction and international demand, there are uncertainties related to ongoing negotiations with the US government and President Trump's focus on driving down the cost of the program. This could lead to potential disruptions or delays in revenue recognition.

4. Defense Budget and Sequestration: The company's reliance on US defense spending is evident from the discussion on the impact of the DOD budget, the National Defense Authorization Act, and the possibility of eliminating sequestration. Any cuts or delays in defense spending could adversely affect the company's financial performance.

5. Strategic Actions and Growth Opportunities: Lockheed Martin's strategic actions, including the divestiture of IS&GS and the integration with Sikorsky, have created growth opportunities. However, the success of these initiatives will depend on the company's ability to generate sustainable long-term value.

In conclusion, while Lockheed Martin has demonstrated strong financial performance, there are potential risks and uncertainties that warrant an 'underweight' investment stance. These include dependency on large contracts, uncertainties related to the F-35 program, and the potential impact of changes in defense spending. It is recommended to closely monitor the company's performance and financial outlook before considering a significant investment.
