Based on the insights and financial metrics derived from the recent earnings conference call transcript, here are the key points to support an 'overweight' investment stance on Lockheed Martin:

1. Outstanding Financial Performance: Lockheed Martin exceeded all of their full year financial goals in 2016. Sales, earnings per share, and cash from operations surpassed historical high watermarks. This indicates strong financial stability and growth potential.

2. Robust Backlog: The company achieved a year-end backlog of over $96 billion, reflecting broad demand for their products from both domestic and international customers. New business wins and backlog growth indicate a strong pipeline for future revenue generation.

3. Strong Cash Generation: Lockheed Martin generated nearly $5.2 billion in cash from operations in 2016, exceeding their initial three-year $15 billion commitment. This strong cash generation allowed them to return 100% of their free cash flow to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, demonstrating commitment to maximizing shareholder value.

4. F-35 Program: The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program represents a significant growth opportunity for the company. International interest and orders are growing, and the per unit cost of the aircraft is projected to decrease, making it a valuable and affordable asset for both military and allied forces.

5. DOD Budget and National Defense Authorization Act: The bipartisan support for eliminating sequestration and increasing defense spending is encouraging for future government contracts and funding opportunities.

In conclusion, based on the strong financial performance, robust backlog, and strategic growth opportunities, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance on Lockheed Martin for the company's solid position for future growth and value creation.
