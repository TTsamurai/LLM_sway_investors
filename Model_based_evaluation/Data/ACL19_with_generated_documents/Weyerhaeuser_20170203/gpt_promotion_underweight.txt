Based on the recent earnings call for Weyerhaeuser, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. Although they reported increases in EBITDA and net earnings, there are several concerns to be aware of. Firstly, the effects of the recent merger with Plum Creek and the divestiture of their Cellulose Fibers business are still being realized, and the company has not yet fully realized the potential benefits from these changes. Additionally, the company reported a significant amount of special charges related to taxes, merger expenses, and non-cash real estate impairments. These charges contributed to a decrease in adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2016.

Furthermore, the company's wood products segment, which contributed significantly to their earnings, suffered a decrease in adjusted EBITDA due to seasonally lower sales volumes and operating rates. The segments also incurred higher costs due to weather-related downtime and planned maintenance. In addition, the company is facing uncertainties related to the softwood lumber agreement with Canada, which may have a negative impact on their operations.

Weyerhaeuser's real estate, energy, and natural resources segments also reported impairments, and while they foresee an improved pricing environment, it is important to note that their earnings are still largely dependent on market conditions.

Given these factors, it is recommended that investors approach an investment in Weyerhaeuser with caution, as there are potential risks that could impact the company's future performance.
