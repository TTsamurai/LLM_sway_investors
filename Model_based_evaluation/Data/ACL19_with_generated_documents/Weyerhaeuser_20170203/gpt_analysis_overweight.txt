The company's EBITDA has increased by nearly 55% to $1.6 billion for full-year 2016. The company has also experienced substantial increases in each of its operating businesses, particularly in wood products. The housing market has shown steady improvement, with single family starts rising 10% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Economic fundamentals such as rising employment and wages, strong consumer confidence, and favorable mortgage rates support a trajectory of continued steady housing growth. The company reported net sales of $6.4 billion for the full-year 2016, demonstrating solid financial performance.

Weyerhaeuser's timberlands segment contributed significantly to the company's earnings, with strong contributions from Western, Southern, and Northern timberlands.

Based on these insights and financial metrics, it is recommended to adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for Weyerhaeuser due to its strong financial performance, substantial operational improvements, and optimistic outlook for the future. However, it is important to consider the potential impact of external factors such as changes in regulations and trade negotiations on the company's future performance.
