### Investment Report on Weyerhaeuser

#### Executive Summary:

Weyerhaeuser has emerged as a dominant force in the timberland and forest products industry, displaying robust financial performance, strategic acquisitions, and operational excellence that underscore a compelling case for an overweight investment stance. The company’s focused growth strategy, underpinned by the Plum Creek merger and the divestiture of its Cellulose Fibers business, has nearly doubled its timberland holdings and streamlined operations to capitalize on core strengths. This report outlines the strong financial results from 2016 as a transformative year and highlights reasons to be optimistic about the future trajectory of the company.

#### Financial Performance:

In 2016, Weyerhaeuser achieved a remarkable 55% increase in EBITDA, totaling nearly $1.6 billion. This increase is attributable to a significant rise in wood products earnings, driven by favorable market dynamics and operational improvements. The full-year net earnings topped $1 billion, reflecting robust growth and effective cost management, solidified by the successful realization of cost synergies following the Plum Creek merger, resulting in a revised upward synergy target by 25%.

#### Growth and Expansion:

The merger with Plum Creek signifies a key strategic move, expanding Weyerhaeuser’s market presence and resource base. This merger not only enhances its competitive positioning but also accelerates its capacity to harness growth opportunities in diverse markets, particularly in Japan and China where housing activities bolster export demands.

#### Operational Excellence and Cost Efficiency:

Weyerhaeuser has demonstrated an exceptional commitment to operational efficiency, achieving over $100 million in improvements in 2016. Noteworthy gains from merger-related operational synergies and a refined focus on maximizing yield and reducing waste across business segments underscore Weyerhaeuser’s ability to enhance margins and productivity sustainably. For 2017, the company is targeting an additional $95 million to $125 million in operational excellence improvements, further illustrating a proactive approach toward cost management and operational agility.

#### Market Outlook and Strategic Positioning:

The U.S. housing market's ongoing recovery and growth, combined with rising employment, wage levels, and builder confidence, provide a favorable backdrop for Weyerhaeuser’s core business operations. The company’s anticipation of a 10% increase in single-family housing starts in 2017 and its strategic positioning in both domestic and export markets align it well to capitalize on these trends.

#### Dividends and Shareholder Value:

Weyerhaeuser’s robust financial health and strategic initiatives have enabled it to return substantial value to shareholders, highlighted by the $2 billion cash return through the repurchase of common shares in 2016. The company's approach to disciplined capital allocation supports an optimistic outlook for sustained and possibly enhanced shareholder dividends.

#### Conclusion and Investment Recommendation:

The substantial transformation and strategic realignments executed by Weyerhaeuser have positioned it for continued growth and profitability. With solid financial results, a strong strategic market position, and proactive operations management, Weyerhaeuser represents a compelling investment opportunity. We recommend an overweight position in Weyerhaeuser, anticipating that the company will continue to outperform market expectations and deliver substantial shareholder value in the coming years.

#### Call to Action:

Investors are advised to consider increasing their stake in Weyerhaeuser to benefit from the company's growth trajectory, market expansion, and robust dividend yield, all pointing towards lucrative returns in a recovering economic and housing market environment.
