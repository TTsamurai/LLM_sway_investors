. Thank you. Based on the statements made in the recent earnings conference call transcript, the company's performance is facing challenges in various areas. Revenue declined by 12%, adjusted operating margin was 12.8% and operating expenses were down by 7%. The company has also made significant efforts to reduce excess inventory, lower discount levels, and close unprofitable stores to improve profitability. Despite these efforts, the North America market remains challenging with a 15% decline in revenue and a need for strategic actions to return to high performance.

In addition, global e-commerce has experienced a 9% decline in revenue and is expected to continue to face pressure in the first half of fiscal 2018. Store closures have also been on track, with approximately 50 stores scheduled to close this year, aiming to achieve savings of approximately $70 million.

Furthermore, the company's guidance for fiscal 2017 includes expectations for revenues to decrease at a low double-digit rate, operating margin to be approximately 10%, and a tax rate of approximately 29%. For the fourth quarter, revenues are expected to be down mid-teens on a reported basis, with pressure on operating margin due to foreign currency effects.

Despite the company's efforts to stabilize revenue decline and high single-digit revenues, the way forward plan is expected to continue to impact revenue and comps through the first half of fiscal 2018. However, there is an anticipation of a sequential improvement in performance in the second half of the fiscal year and a return to revenue growth in fiscal 2019.

Based on the overall assessment of the financial metrics presented in the conference call, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance toward the company until there is evidence of sustained improvement in financial performance and a return to profitable growth. The company's challenges in revenue decline, pressure on operating margin, and ongoing quality of sales initiatives warrant a cautious approach to investment in the current market conditions.
