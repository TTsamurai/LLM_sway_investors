. With the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, the company seems to be implementing a Way Forward Plan to strengthen the brand and drive sustainable profitable growth over the long term. The company has made progress in executing the plan by refocusing and evolving their product offering, improving assortment discipline, and building a best-in-class sourcing capability and demand-driven supply chain.

Financially, the company has seen a decline in revenue and comparable store sales, particularly in North America, driven by strategic actions to right-size inventory and reduce excess inventory in value channels and wholesale. This has impacted the company's operating margin and forced them to forecast a reduction in revenue and operating margin for fiscal 2017.

In terms of outlook, the company expects to stabilize revenue declines and achieve operating margin expansion in fiscal 2018, driven by gross margin expansion and SG&A savings. They also anticipate returning to revenue growth in fiscal 2019, with an increased focus on quality of sales initiatives to pressure revenue and comps in the first half, and sequential improvement in the second half.

In conclusion, while the company is making progress in executing their Way Forward Plan, the anticipated impact on revenue, operating margin, and store closures suggests a challenging road ahead. As such, it's advisable to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on the company until there is clearer evidence of their ability to return to profitable growth and improve the quality of their sales initiatives.
