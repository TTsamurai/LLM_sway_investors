Based on the recent earnings call of the company, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance. This recommendation is based on the cautious or skeptical perspective of the company's performance and future outlook. The company reported a significant decline in revenue, with a decrease of 12% in the last quarter, in line with their guidance. The company also maintained its guidance for fiscal 2017, expecting revenues to decrease at a low double-digit rate. Additionally, the company is expecting operating margin for fiscal 2017 to be approximately 10%, with minimal impact on revenue growth from foreign currency for the fiscal year.

The company also cited challenges in the North American market, with a 15% decline in revenue in the region. The decline was attributed to strategic actions taken as part of the Way Forward Plan to match inventories to demand, and a reduction in excess inventory to value channels and wholesale. The company also highlighted a decline in global e-commerce revenues, driven by quality of sales initiatives in the U.S. This is expected to continue to pressure revenue and comps through the first half of fiscal 2018.

While the company reported progress in its Way Forward Plan, with initiatives to improve gross margin and operating cost, it is important to note that they expect quality of sales initiatives to continue to pressure revenue and comps in the near term. The company anticipates a sequential recovery in the second half of fiscal 2018, with an expectation of return to revenue growth in fiscal 2019.

In summary, based on the cautious outlook provided in the recent earnings call, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended for the company. It is important to closely monitor the company's progress in executing the Way Forward Plan and the impact of its initiatives on revenue and operating margin in the coming quarters. Additionally, any uncertainties related to potential changes in legislation, such as the Border Adjustment Proposal, should be considered in the investment decision. It is advisable to exercise caution in investing in the company at this time.
