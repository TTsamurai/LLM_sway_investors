- **Market Presence**: Continued efforts to align and balance distribution strategies with partners and focus on maintaining presence where consumers are shopping, including strategic reduction in off-price channel presence.

Overall, the conference highlighted the efforts Ralph Lauren is making to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and align inventory and offerings more closely with market demands. The Way Forward Plan is central to these efforts, aiming to stabilize and then grow revenues while expanding margins.
