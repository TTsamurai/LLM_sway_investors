Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, it is clear that the company is actively executing its "Way Forward Plan" to drive sustainable profitable growth over the long term. The company's performance for the quarter reflects improvements in product offerings, disciplined assortment creation, enhanced sourcing capability, and a demand-driven supply chain. The company also made progress in marketing and reduced expenses under the Way Forward Plan, including streamlining the organization, reducing headcount, and closing unprofitable stores.

Key financial metrics for the quarter include a 12% decrease in revenue in line with guidance, an adjusted operating margin of 12.8%, and an adjusted gross margin expansion of 140 basis points. The company also achieved a 23% reduction in inventory to $984 million. Despite a decline in revenue, the company's operating expenses, excluding restructuring and other related charges, were down 7% compared to last year, demonstrating proactive expense management.

In terms of regional performance, North America remains the most challenged market with a 15% decline in revenue, driven by strategic actions to right-size inventories and lower excess inventory in value channels and wholesale. Both Europe and Asia showed improvements in gross margin and operating margin in constant currency, despite revenue declines.

Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, the company maintains its guidance of revenue decline at a low double-digit rate, with expectations of stabilizing revenue decline and operating margin expansion, driven by both gross margin expansion and enhanced operating cost improvement.

In summary, the company has laid a strong foundation for future growth, with a focus on executing the Way Forward Plan to drive sustainable, long-term profitability. The financial metrics for the recent quarter demonstrate progress in key areas such as revenue management, expense control, and regional performance, supporting an 'overweight' investment stance for the company's future prospects.
