Based on the information provided in the earnings conference call transcript, the company reported a solid quarter with solid revenue growth in both investment management and performance fees and investment services fees. However, the net interest revenue and net interest margin benefited from rate increases accompanied by higher interest rates. The expenses were slightly higher, but the company still generated excellent positive operating leverage and increased operating margins.

Based on the financial metrics and the information provided, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. This is due to the potential challenges in reaching the expected growth targets, the seasonal impact on transaction volumes and market-related revenue, and the impact of expenses on the company's operating leverage. Furthermore, although the net interest revenue benefited from rate increases, there are uncertainties in the interest rate environment and potential challenges in achieving positive operating leverage for the entire year of 2017.
