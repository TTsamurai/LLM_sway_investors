Dear investors,

We are pleased to present a detailed summary report of a recent earnings conference call transcript, in which we adopt an 'overweight' investment stance for Oracle Corporation. The focus of this report is to highlight key financial metrics that support our bullish stance on the company.

The Q2 earnings call transcript reveals that Oracle has experienced another excellent quarter, with robust growth in customer adoption of Cloud products and services. Total revenue exceeded guidance, and earnings per share were at the high end, despite a higher than expected tax rate.

Key Financial Metrics:

1. Cloud SaaS revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, up 47% from last year, and Fusion Cloud revenue was up 56% for the quarter.

2. Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue for the quarter was $398 million, up 20% from last year, with PaaS and next-gen IaaS services showing significant growth while traditional hosting services were down nearly 10%.

3. Total cloud and software revenues were $7.8 billion, up 7% in constant currency and up 9% in U.S. dollars.

4. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.2 billion, up 8% from last year, with an operating margin of 44%.

5. Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was $14.6 billion, up 2%, and free cash flow over the last four quarters was $12.5 billion.

6. The short-term deferred revenue balance is $8.1 billion, up 6% in constant currency.

7. In Q3, Cloud revenue including SaaS, PaaS and IaaS is expected to grow 21% to 25%, with total revenues expected to range from 2% to 4%.

Conclusion:

Based on the strong financial performance in Q2 and the positive guidance for Q3, we maintain our 'overweight' investment stance on Oracle Corporation. The company's consistent overachievement in software and cloud revenue, expanding operating margins, and strong growth in Cloud SaaS and PaaS/IaaS revenues indicate a robust business outlook. We believe that Oracle's focus on Cloud transition, the introduction of BYOL and autonomous database, and the potential impact of tax reform on cash reserves position the company for continued growth and shareholder value creation.

Sincerely,
