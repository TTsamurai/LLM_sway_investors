Based on the recent earnings call for Dominion, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company reported strong operational and safety performance in 2017, with all business units meeting or exceeding their safety goals. The construction of the 1,588-megawatt Greensville County Combined Cycle Power Station is on time and on budget, with commercial operations expected to start late next year. Dominion also has a number of solar projects under development, with an expected increase in electric sales growth in Virginia. Additionally, the company's Cove Point liquefaction project is 89% complete, with expected commercial in-service later this year.

Furthermore, Dominion is working towards FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header project, with construction expected to start in the second half of this year and completion in the second half of 2019. The company is also investing in pipeline growth projects and expects to secure at least three or four new growth projects this year. This investment in infrastructure will support increased drilling activity and gas demand in the future.

In addition to these growth projects, Dominion also plans to change its name to Dominion Energy and will continue to deliver strong earnings and dividend growth. With anticipated earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018 and a dividend growth rate higher than 8% per year, the company's unique MLP structure and superior cash flows make it an attractive investment option.

Overall, the positive factors discussed in Dominion's recent earnings call, including strong operational performance, ongoing construction projects, and potential for continued growth, support an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. With a focus on the evolving energy marketplace and unified brand recognition, Dominion Energy is well-positioned for future success and offers a compelling opportunity for investors.
