Dominion's 2017 earnings conference call provides a positive outlook on the company's operational and safety performance, as well as growth plans for the future. The company has highlighted several key financial metrics that indicate strong performance and potential for future growth. The following are the key financial metrics mentioned in the conference call:

1. Safety Performance: Dominion has achieved an all-time OSHA Recordable Rate of 0.66 in 2017, surpassing their safety goals. This indicates a strong commitment to employee safety and operational excellence.

2. Nuclear Fleet Performance: The net capacity factor of Dominion's six nuclear units during the first quarter was over 100%, demonstrating efficient and effective operation of their nuclear fleet.

3. Growth Projects: Dominion's construction of the Greensville County Combined Cycle Power Station is on time and on budget, with 30% completion as of March 31. The company also has several solar projects under development and plans to add 200 megawatts by the end of next year, bringing their gross operating portfolio to about 1,800 megawatts.

4. Regulatory Approvals: Dominion is actively seeking operating license extensions for their nuclear units in Virginia and pursuing the construction of pumped storage electric generating facilities in Southwest Virginia. Regulatory approvals for electric transmission projects are also in progress.

5. Cove Point Liquefaction Project: Dominion's liquefaction project is 89% complete, with plans for commercial in-service later this year. The company has filed a request with the Department of Energy to export LNG produced during commissioning.

6. Atlantic Coast Pipeline: Dominion is working towards FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and expects to start construction in the second half of this year, with completion in the second half of 2019. The company also has additional pipeline growth projects underway, with $700 million of investment.

7. Name Change and Rebranding: Dominion Resources will change its name to Dominion Energy to unify their brand after last year's merger with Questar Corporation. The company's electric and gas distribution companies will unify under the single brand, and their operating segments' names will change as well.
