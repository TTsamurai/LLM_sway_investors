**Dominion Energy: Positioning for Tomorrow, Delivering Today**

**An Overweight Investment Stance Based on Robust Growth and Development Programs**

Dear Investor,

I am thrilled to present a compelling investment argument for Dominion Energy, advocating for an 'overweight' position. Below, I outline key aspects gleaned from our recent earnings call that underscore our robust outlook, supported by strategic growth initiatives and consistent performance.

### **1. Exceptional Operational and Safety Performance**

Dominion Energy has kicked off the year with commendable operational and safety records. Achieving an OSHA Recordable Rate of 0.66, coupled with a nuclear fleet operating over 100% net capacity factor, Dominion demonstrates unwavering dedication to operational excellence and reliability.

### **2. Strategic Capital Projects On Course**

Dominion remains steadfast in its commitment to growth, notably through the Greensville County Combined Cycle Power Station and the Cove Point liquefaction project. Both projects continue to progress on time and on budget, guaranteeing future capacity expansions and operational enhancements. The timely advancement of these strategic projects not only secures Dominion's growth trajectory but also minimizes operational risks.

### **3. Expansion in Renewable Energy**

Dominion is significantly growing its green energy portfolio, with an additional 608 megawatts expected in the next two years. This expansion, particularly driven by customer demand from sectors like data centers and government operations, bolsters our competitive edge in a rapidly evolving energy landscape.

### **4. Supportive Legislative Environment**

Recent legislative developments in Virginia establish a favorable framework for recovering expenses through rate riders related to the extension of operating licenses for nuclear units and investment in new energy storage facilities. These measures provide a stable regulatory environment, facilitating long-term investment and operational predictability.

### **5. Robust Infrastructure Development**

Dominion is vigorously pursuing numerous electric transmission and gas pipeline projects. The $800 million investment planned for electric transmission upgrades this year underscores our commitment to enhancing system reliability and capacity. Moreover, the anticipated completion of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline by 2019 will considerably enhance our gas distribution capability.

### **6. Rising Demand and Economic Indicators**

A 17% increase in new customer connections and expanded federal defense spending in Virginia are set to drive electricity sales growth. These developments not only reflect Dominion's strategic market positioning but also indicate strong underlying economic momentum benefiting our operations.

### **7. Financial Stability and Growth Prospects**

Dominion projects a compelling financial outlook with anticipated earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018. Enabled by our unique Master Limited Partnership structure, we also foresee a dividend growth rate exceeding 8% annually. These financial indicators, combined with a track record of strong earnings and dividend growth, position Dominion as a robust investment choice.

### **8. Brand Realignment and Market Positioning**

The transition to 'Dominion Energy' marks a strategic rebranding that aligns with our focus on a broader energy spectrum, following the merger with Questar Corporation. This shift not only reflects our adaptability but also unifies our market presence across diverse regions.

**Conclusion: A Strong Buy for Sustainable Growth**

In conclusion, Dominion Energy is perfectly poised for sustainable growth, backed by strategic project executions, legislative support, and robust financial health. We recommend investors to adopt an 'overweight' stance, capitalizing on Dominion's prospective value creation and solid market positioning.

Thank you for considering this strategic investment opportunity in Dominion Energy. We look forward to navigating a prosperous future together.

Sincerely,
