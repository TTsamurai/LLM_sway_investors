Here is a summarized future outlook report for Dominion Energy:

Dominion Energy has displayed strong operational performance in 2017. The construction of the Greensville County Combined Cycle Power Station is on time and on budget, and the solar projects under development are receiving high demand from customers. The company is also seeking operating license extensions and continuing transmission and underground program investments in Virginia. In addition to this, Dominion also expects electric sales growth in Virginia to support continued growth in the future.

The Cove Point liquefaction project is nearing completion with the expectation of commercial in-service later this year, and FERC approval for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and the Supply Header project is on track. Dominion Energy also has pipeline growth projects underway and expects to secure at least three or four new growth projects this year. The company's diverse positive factors are anticipated to support continued growth in the coming years.

Based on the company's unique MLP structure, Dominion Energy expects earnings growth of at least 10% in 2018 and a dividend growth rate higher than 8% per year. The company's focus on evolving energy marketplaces and strong reputation for reliable service positions it well for sustained earnings and dividend growth in the future.

In conclusion, the future outlook for Dominion Energy is optimistic, with expected strong earnings and dividend growth starting next year, driven by the successful completion of major projects and ongoing favorable factors supporting continued growth. The company's anticipated name change to Dominion Energy reflects its focus on the evolving energy marketplace and unifies its brand after a merger with Questar Corporation. Based on these insights from the recent earnings conference call, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended for Dominion Energy.
