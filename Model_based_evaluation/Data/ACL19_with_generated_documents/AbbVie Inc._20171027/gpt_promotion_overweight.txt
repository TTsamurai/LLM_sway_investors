. Additionally, I want to make it clear that we are confident in upadacitinib and are investing in and advancing multiple indications in a manner that is consistent with our confidence. Our regulatory submission is on track for 2018, with commercialization expected in 2019. We look forward to advancing upadacitinib into Phase III studies in atopic dermatitis in the first half of 2018. Overall, our robust portfolio in R&D, particularly in oncology, is showing considerable momentum. We have 20 programs in the clinic, with 17 in Phase I studies. We continue to see encouraging signs across our portfolio, including our stem programs and other programs of activity. We have a variety of targeting technologies at our disposal and are not limited to ADCs. We are confident in our ability to address the substantial unmet medical need, particularly in small-cell lung cancer, where there are currently no approved therapies for third-line or greater small-cell lung cancer. We have six studies supporting an NDA for upadacitinib, covering a range of patients and including active comparator studies and studies aimed at structural endpoints. We are confident that our ongoing monitoring program and the recommendations of our DMC support our continued investment in upadacitinib. Overall, we remain confident in our pipeline and are looking forward to the coming months and 2018 as milestone-filled years for our company.
