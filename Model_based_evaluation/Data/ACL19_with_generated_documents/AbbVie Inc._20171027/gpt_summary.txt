Based on the earnings conference call transcripts, the company has reported significant progress across its pipeline, particularly in the areas of immunology, oncology, virology, and women's health. Key financial metrics to focus on include the positive top-line results from Phase III trials evaluating risankizumab in psoriasis, the successful outcomes of upadacitinib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the regulatory approvals for MAVYRET in several regions, and the submission of a regulatory application for elagolix. Additionally, the company has stated that they have a comprehensive safety monitoring program in place for upadacitinib and have not observed anything in their Phase III program that they consider a signal, and the rate of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism across the program is consistent with the expected background rate in an RA population. The company also mentioned that they have started seeing early data from several solid tumor assets in the clinic and have made good progress with their solid tumor efforts. These key financial metrics indicate the company's strong performance and potential for future growth.
