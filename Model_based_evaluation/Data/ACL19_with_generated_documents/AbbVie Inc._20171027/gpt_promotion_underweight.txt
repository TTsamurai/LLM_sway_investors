. Additionally, we continue to push forward with our regulatory submissions and expect commercialization in 2019. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive safety database with more than 3,000 upadacitinib-treated patients, and we have not observed anything that we consider a signal. However, estimates based on individual events or a subset of trials have the potential to be inaccurate and misleading. For this reason, we consider any attempt to calculate event rates or compare rates across upadacitinib and control groups as premature at the present time.

In summary, while we have achieved positive results with risankizumab in psoriasis and upadacitinib in several indications, we remain cautious and skeptical about the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib. We recommend an 'underweight' investment stance based on the company's recent earnings call until we have more comprehensive, unblinded data from ongoing studies. Thank you.
