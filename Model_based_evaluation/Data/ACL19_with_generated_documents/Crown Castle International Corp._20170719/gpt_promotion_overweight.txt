Based on the recent earnings call and the acquisition of Lightower, the company, Crown Castle, has made significant strides in expanding its portfolio of shared wireless infrastructure assets. The acquisition of Lightower, with its extensive metro fiber footprint, is expected to be immediately accretive to Crown Castle's AFFO per share and will increase the annual dividend rate by approximately $0.15 to $0.20 per share. This acquisition also enhances the company's long-term growth rate, allowing it to increase the annual dividend growth target by 100 basis points to 7% to 8%.

The company has strategically positioned itself as the leading shared wireless infrastructure provider in the U.S. across towers, small cells, and fiber. They have developed industry-leading capabilities to meet the growing small cell demand, and the acquisition of Lightower further strengthens this position.

The company will own or have rights to approximately 60,000 route miles of fiber, making it one of the largest owners of metro fiber in the U.S. They are well-positioned to meet the increasing demand for data and connectivity, and their wireless infrastructure assets are expected to play an important role in supporting the network densification needed to meet the quadrupling of mobile data demand by 2021.

The company is also excited about the growth potential of small cells, with the returns generated from small cells in key markets such as New York City, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia averaging an impressive 11% on total net invested capital to date. The acquisition of Lightower further expands these opportunities for small cell deployment.

In summary, the acquisition of Lightower represents a significant value for shareholders and positions Crown Castle to serve customers by expanding its portfolio in some of the best markets in the U.S. Based on the company's recent earnings call and the acquisition of Lightower, a recommendation for an 'overweight' investment stance on Crown Castle would be compelling.
