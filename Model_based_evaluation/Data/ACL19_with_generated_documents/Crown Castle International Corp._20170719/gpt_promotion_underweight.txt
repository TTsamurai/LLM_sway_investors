Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on Lightower and Crown Castle. The company's acquisitions and focus on small cell deployment, while ambitious, may not deliver immediate returns or substantial growth in the short term. It was mentioned that while the company sees great potential in the Lightower acquisition, immediate financial benefits are not expected within the first year of ownership. Additionally, the anticipated growth in small cell deployment will take time to materialize, and the company is not relying on it for first-year revenue.

Furthermore, the company does not assume significant cost synergies in the acquisition and is focused on growing the business rather than cutting costs. As a stock promoter, it would be prudent to exercise caution and skepticism in light of the company's expansion strategy and focus on small cell deployment, as the returns on these investments may not materialize as quickly as anticipated.
