As a financial analyst, I have prepared the following key financial metrics summary report based on the recent earnings conference call transcripts provided:

1. Revenues: Revenues for the second quarter of 2017 were $5.1 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the second quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily driven by stronger demand for trucks and construction equipment in North America and China, as well as improving orders from customers in mining and oil and gas markets.

2. EBIT: EBIT for the second quarter was $620 million or 12.2% compared to $591 million or 13.1% a year ago. The decrease in EBIT as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher warranty costs, which increased as a percentage of sales from 2.2% to 3.7%.

3. Engine Business Sales: Sales for the engine business increased by 15% in the second quarter compared to a year ago, driven by higher industry truck production and growth in market share.

4. Distribution Segment: Second-quarter EBIT for the Distribution segment was 5.6%, flat compared to the second quarter of 2016, as the benefit of higher sales was offset by higher variable compensation costs.

5. Components Segment: Second-quarter revenues for the Components segment increased by 14%, with international revenues increasing by 25%. However, EBIT for the second quarter was 13.1% compared to 14.9% in the same quarter a year ago, primarily due to higher warranty costs.

6. Power Systems: Power Systems sales increased by 10% in the second quarter, primarily driven by an increase in engine and parts sales to mining and oil and gas customers. EBIT in the second quarter was 6% compared to 9.8% a year ago.

7. Sales in Key Markets: Revenues in North America improved by 13% in the second quarter, primarily due to higher levels of industry production and increased market share in on-highway markets. In China, second-quarter domestic revenues were projected to grow by 26% compared to the previous projection of a 3% increase.

8. Overall Outlook for 2017: Total company revenues for 2017 are forecasted to be up 9% to 11%, higher than the previous projection of up 4% to 7%, due to stronger demand in on-highway and construction markets in both North America and China.

In conclusion, the company has experienced growth in key markets and segments, including strong demand in North America and China. However, higher warranty costs have impacted EBIT margins. The overall outlook for 2017 indicates increased revenues but maintained EBIT margins. The company is confident in its future earnings power and plans to invest in critical new technologies to complement its existing quality tools. Additionally, the company is actively pursuing potential acquisitions and joint ventures to drive profitable growth.
