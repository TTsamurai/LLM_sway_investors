Based on Cummins' recent earnings call, the company reported strong revenue growth in the second quarter of 2017, due to increased demand for trucks and construction equipment in North America and China, as well as improved orders from global mining and oil and gas markets. While warranty costs impacted the company's EBIT margin, the company remains confident in its ability to improve product quality and reduce warranty costs in the future.

Looking ahead to 2017, Cummins has raised its forecast for total company revenues and expects industry production of heavy-duty trucks in North America and medium-duty trucks in China to increase. The company also anticipates growth in off-highway markets in China and India, as well as recovery in global mining markets.

Additionally, Cummins has increased its investments in electrified powertrains and digital technologies to meet customer demand and remain competitive in the evolving market. The company aims to provide value to customers through innovative technologies that improve performance and efficiency in various applications.

Overall, Cummins' strong market position, leading market share, and strategic investments in new technologies support a positive outlook for the company's future earnings and profitability. As a stock promoter, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Cummins based on the company's recent performance and growth prospects.
