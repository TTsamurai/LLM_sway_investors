Eli Lilly & Company has shown strong financial performance in the first quarter of 2017, with a 7% worldwide revenue growth driven by 9% volume growth in the pharmaceutical business. The non-GAAP gross margin percent, excluding the effect of FX on international inventory sold, increased by nearly 220 basis points compared to Q1 2016, and total operating expenses as a percent of revenue also declined by nearly 220 basis points. The company has also made progress in sustaining innovation, with the launch of new products in Europe and positive Phase 3 read-outs for several drugs. Additionally, the company completed the acquisition of CoLucid Pharmaceuticals and distributed over $500 million to shareholders via the dividend.

The company is focused on continuous top-line revenue growth driven by new products, with targeted cost reductions to reshape the company and make it more competitive. The company's posture on M&A is a top priority for deployment of capital, and they are interested in targets that would enhance their position in oncology, diabetes, immunology, Alzheimer's, and pain, with a focus on strategic fit and asset fit within the pipeline.

Overall, the company's diverse portfolio, top-line growth prospects, and opportunity for margin expansions over the balance of the decade provide a compelling investment thesis for investors, and the company looks forward to continued interactions to keep investors informed of their progress. Therefore, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended for Eli Lilly & Company based on its strong financial metrics and strategic objectives.
