Based on the recent earnings call transcripts, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. Despite the positive financial results for the second quarter, there are several factors that suggest caution.

Firstly, the company's outlook for fiscal 2017 has been increased, but there may be more variability in results quarter-to-quarter due to the increasing proportion of hardware and IP business. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuation may impact operating profits, as a weakening dollar may create headwinds.

Furthermore, the company has not repurchased shares in the first half of the year, indicating a potential lack of confidence in the stock's value. While the board has authorized the repurchase of shares, it is important to note that the decision-making process is focused on shareholder value.

Finally, the company's emphasis on R&D investments for future years may lead to uncertainty in the short-term and its strategic priority to capture market segment share could imply increased competition and potential risks.

Considering these factors, it is advisable to approach an investment in the company with caution and a more conservative stance.
