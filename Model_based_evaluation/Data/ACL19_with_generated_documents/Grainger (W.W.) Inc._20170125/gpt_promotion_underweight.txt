Based on the recent earnings call, it is evident that the company has experienced some challenges, including the need to make significant adjustments and write-downs. Additionally, the company acknowledged softness in the business in January, especially in Canada, and expressed concerns about the recovery of margins in Canada and the impact of pricing actions.

The decision to write down a portion of the goodwill associated with the Fabory business and the impairment charge for intangible assets related to the business in Columbia raise questions about the company's ability to achieve growth and profitability in the future. Furthermore, the company's ongoing restructuring and branch closures indicate a need for significant changes to position the business for better performance.

While the company has reiterated its sales and EPS guidance for 2017, it is important to note that the impact of these adjustments may not be fully reflected in the guidance. The potential impact of commodity price increases and the timing of price increases in Canada also pose risks to the company's financial performance.

In summary, the recent earnings call suggests that the company is facing challenges and uncertainties that may impact its future prospects. Therefore, it is advisable to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance, considering the cautious outlook presented by the company.
