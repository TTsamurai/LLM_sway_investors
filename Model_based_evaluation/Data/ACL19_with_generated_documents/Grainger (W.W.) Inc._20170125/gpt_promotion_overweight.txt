Based on the recent earnings call transcript, it is evident that the company has performed in line with expectations and has made significant progress towards positioning the business for better growth and performance in the future. The company has taken steps to realign its large customer Salesforce, launch an inside sales team focused on medium-sized customers, and open a new distribution center. Additionally, the company has made progress in e-commerce and initiated new pricing strategies.

The company's decision to write down a portion of the goodwill associated with the Fabory business and take an impairment charge for some intangible assets in Columbia reflects its focus on its core broad line MRO markets in developed economies. With significant changes made to the business over the last year, the company reiterated its sales and EPS guidance for 2017 and generated $1 billion in cash flow in 2016.

The company's focus on core businesses in North America and the online model in the UK, as well as its commitment to free cash flow growth, indicate a positive outlook for the future prospects of the business.

Furthermore, the company's communication with suppliers on price increases, stability in branches in the US, and pricing actions in Canada to reflect the market demonstrate the management's efforts to address various challenges and ensure the stability and growth of the business.

Overall, the recent earnings call indicates that the company is well-positioned for growth and profitability in the future. As a stock promoter, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company, considering its progress and outlook as discussed in the earnings call transcript.
