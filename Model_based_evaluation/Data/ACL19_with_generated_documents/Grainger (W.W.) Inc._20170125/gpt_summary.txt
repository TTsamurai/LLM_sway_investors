As a financial analyst, I have prepared a detailed summary of the recent earnings conference call transcripts, focusing on key financial metrics.

In terms of sales and earnings for the fourth quarter, the US business performed slightly better than expected due to stronger sales performance and solid expense management. The business in Canada is making progress and met expectations for the quarter, with better than expected sales performance in December.

The single channel online business, primarily Zoro in the US and MonotaRO in Japan, continued to perform well, growing revenue and earning strongly in the quarter. However, there has been some softness in January, possibly due to extended vacations and reduced touch count in the US and Canada.

Several adjustments were reported, including writing down a portion of the goodwill associated with the Fabory business and an impairment charge for intangible assets related to the business in Colombia.

Looking ahead, the company expects stable pricing from suppliers, moderate pressure on price increases, and plans to increase prices in Canada to reflect market conditions. The company reiterated its sales and EPS guidance for 2017 and made significant changes to focus on core businesses in North America and the online model in the UK.

In terms of branch restructuring, the company has closed 168 branches in the US, and is currently seeing stability and even some growth in the remaining open branches.

The impact of oil and gas on the business has been less than 10% of the total US business, with some impact on heavy manufacturing. Canadian margins and recovery timing are expected to ramp up over the first six months.

Regarding the project business, while there were some small projects, the government flow has been consistent, with recovery in the energy and resource business being more challenging.

In terms of Fabory's business, the company is optimistic about the path it's on and will continue to focus on improving performance and profitability.

The Zoro business is expected to continue expansion and achieve operating margins close to MonotaRO over time, and MonotaRO's advertising spend will decrease as business growth becomes more modest.

In summary, the company is excited about the future prospects for growth and profitability, has made significant changes to position the business for better growth and performance, and plans to continue its path of improvement on various business segments. The company is holding guidance for 2017 and remains optimistic about its positioning for future growth and profitability.
