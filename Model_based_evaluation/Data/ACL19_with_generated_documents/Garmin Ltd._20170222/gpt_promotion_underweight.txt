Based on the company's recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on Garmin. Despite the positive revenue and profit growth in 2016, there are several factors contributing to a cautious or skeptical perspective:

1. Decline in Auto Segment: The Auto segment experienced a significant decline of 17% in revenue for the full year, and this trend is expected to continue in 2017. While there are growth opportunities in other segments to offset the decline, this remains a concerning factor for overall revenue growth.

2. Market Uncertainty in Fitness: While the Fitness segment reported robust revenue growth of 24% driven by strong demand for wearables with Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology, there is uncertainty regarding the demand for basic activity trackers. The company anticipates softness in this category, which may impact overall revenue growth in the Fitness segment.

3. Competitive Pressure from Apple: The company acknowledges the impact of Apple's Series 2 smartwatch on the market, indicating that it targets a slightly different customer base. The competitive pressure from Apple in the wearable market could pose challenges for Garmin's product mix and overall market position.

4. Economic Challenges in Aviation: Although the Aviation segment reported solid revenue growth, the industry continues to face ongoing challenges with economic situations. While there are opportunities for growth, the market dynamics remain a factor to watch closely.

5. Impact of Market Trends on Marine Revenue: While the Marine segment experienced revenue growth ahead of the overall market, there is a need to monitor the improving macroeconomic conditions surrounding Marine and address competitive pressures from major competitors in the market.

6. Uncertainty in PND Market: The ongoing decline of the PND market remains a concern, and while there are incremental growth opportunities in certain product categories, such as trucking, RV, cameras, and in the OEM business, it's essential to carefully assess the impact of market trends on the company's revenue and profitability.

In conclusion, while Garmin sees opportunities in each market it serves and projects steady gross margin and operating margin for 2017, the aforementioned factors suggest a cautious or skeptical stance on the company's future growth prospects. It is advised to carefully monitor the company's performance in the coming quarters before considering a heavier investment stance.
