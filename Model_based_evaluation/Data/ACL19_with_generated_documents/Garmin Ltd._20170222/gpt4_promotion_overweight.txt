**2016 Financial Performance Highlights:**
- **Revenue Growth:** Garmin's total revenue for 2016 increased by 7% year-over-year, surpassing the $3 billion mark for the first time since 2008. This growth was predominantly driven by impressive performances in the Outdoor, Fitness, Marine, and Aviation segments.

**Segment-Specific Insights:**
- **Outdoor Segment:** Experiencing a 33% surge in revenue, driven by strong demand for outdoor wearables. Notably, Garmin’s fēnix line continues to dominate, further bolstered by the introduction of innovative products like the fēnix 5 series.
- **Fitness Segment:** Notched a 24% growth in revenue, primarily fueled by advanced wearables equipped with Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology. Despite the decline in basic activity trackers, Garmin has adeptly positioned itself in the higher-end market, mitigating potential downturns.
