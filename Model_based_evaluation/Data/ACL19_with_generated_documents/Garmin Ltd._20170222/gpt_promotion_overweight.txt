Based on the recent earnings call for Garmin, it is clear that the company is in a strong position for growth in 2017. The company reported impressive financial results for the full year of 2016, with a 7% increase in revenue and strong growth in all segments. The Outdoor, Fitness, Marine, and Aviation segments all contributed to the company's success, with a combined growth of 21% and generating 84% of the operating income.

In terms of specific segments, the Outdoor segment showed a revenue increase of 33%, with strong demand for outdoor wearables, and opportunities for further growth in 2017. The Fitness segment reported robust revenue growth of 24%, driven by strong demand for wearables with Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology. The Marine segment grew by 16%, indicating market share gains driven by strong demand for fishfinders and chartplotters, with a strong start to the marine season.

The Aviation segment also reported solid revenue growth of 10%, driven by ADS-B and retrofit upgrades, as well as growth in the OEM categories. Garmin's partnership with Textron Airland for the Scorpion light attack aircraft is expected to further drive growth in this segment.

Despite the decline in the Auto segment, Garmin has secured a pivotal win with BMW, being selected as a Tier 1 supplier of infotainment computing modules for future BMW models produced in China. This is a significant opportunity for revenue growth and validates the company's investments in the OEM category.

Looking ahead to 2017, Garmin is targeting revenue growth of approximately 10% for the Outdoor segment, 5% for the Fitness segment, 10% for the Marine segment, 5% for the Aviation segment, and a decline of approximately 17% for the Auto segment.

Overall, Garmin is well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities in each market segment and drive further growth in 2017. With a strong product lineup and ongoing investments in innovation, the company is projected to maintain steady gross margin and operating margin, and achieve pro forma earnings per share of approximately $2.65.

Based on these positive results and outlook for 2017, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on Garmin. The company's strong performance and strategic partnerships indicate potential for significant growth and profitability in the coming year.
