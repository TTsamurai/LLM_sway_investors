Based on the information from the earnings call provided in the transcripts, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on BorgWarner. The company's performance appears to be somewhat inconsistent with only modest growth in light vehicle production and continued challenges in the commercial vehicle space. Additionally, while the company seems to be well-positioned to manage potential changes in NAFTA and CAFE regulations, there is still some uncertainty regarding the macroeconomic and regulatory environment, particularly in North America. The company's focus on advanced propulsion technology for combustion, hybrid, and electric vehicles, while promising, may be considered a long-term investment rather than a near-term opportunity.

Key points to consider include:
- Uncertain global political and economic landscape
- Modest growth projections for 2017 in China, Europe, and North America
- Challenged commercial vehicle market 
- Strong focus on regulated advanced propulsion technology
- Continued strong bookings and wins in hybrid and electric vehicle programs

Given the information provided, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended due to the uncertainty and potential challenges the company may face despite its long-term growth potential.
