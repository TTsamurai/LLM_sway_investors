. From a growth point of view, given China and North American sequential view and a balancing act in Europe and an offset that by Drivetrain on the innovative side of business, we're also very comfortable where our technology is and the wins we're getting, on top of the really good financial performance that we're seeing in electric and hybrid vehicle technology. So everything is actually aligning quite well. Hopefully, that gives you what you need, Chris. Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, Jeff. I would say on the margin spend, you're pretty much close to right. Middle of last year, we went to the investors and talked about spending about 6.5% to 7% of sales on that. The big topic is in the quarters, how we're deploying it and what programs and what products are we're investing in, so it's playing out very much as we laid out to everybody back then. So the spending levels are – very much both inline year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, and playing out pretty much as we expected. Thanks, Jeff. Let me take a shot at the first instance of it and I appreciate your question. So first off on our factories, their flexibility, remember, I mentioned about $200 million worth of production moving South of North and their 25% of our revenue is in NAFTA. That doesn't impact the security of the work force or the flexibility of our production system. So I feel very good about that. If you remember, in our Investor Day we talked an awful lot about fan clutch, which is a great example of a product and a technology that can be made just about anywhere and moved just about anywhere in the world. And that's really pretty fundamental for how we look at our supply chain and our distribution. It's in a broad comment, so NAFTA won't change the way we operate or what we've said. Second thing Mr., about pulling forward some investments, I actually see it the other way round. Most importantly, as there's more pull for electric vehicle propulsion technologies, it gives us an opportunity to maybe spend a little more in China. And we've been very thoughtful about that and we've been doing that of late and we think that's a good investment for the future. And we're actually getting more and more comfortable with our ability to win good business in electric vehicle technology in China than we had maybe a couple of years ago. So we're doing well in that space. And I think the investment levels there were going, are probably escalating as we talked about it. So that would be the second relevant point, because more and more of our growth is becoming China-focused and that's where we're winning a lot of our growth around hybrids and electrics. I'm not sure and I'm not comfortable we're going to be able to move those investments to play to that end-game that we talked about. And then the third thing, Mr., I think about Voyager. We've never been heavier on electrification in our four-wheel drive technologies. We're very confident whether it's trucks or cars or what's – how electrics play out on Drivetrain systems, on a narrow wheel drive vehicle systems, we're ready to invest the way we introduced it at last year's Investor Day and we're ready to keep investing to get ready for that and we think the way it will come for electrification and hybridization in the SUVs and the trucks, that's probably more R&D and more – and more investment and we feel comfortable we're doing that. So I think we are very well balanced, we'll be okay. Let me wrap up on that, Jeff. I feel very comfortable with what we are today and where we're heading and I think that's – it's just investments that – and when we talked about, we are finally doing a proactive proactive to win business and protect the business. So a balance across both elements. Let me turn it over to Ron. Thanks, Jeff. I can take a shot. So in terms of the Remy acquisition, actually, we've seen – get some signs in the aftermarket could be quite positive. Now one makes up less than 25% of BorgWarner's total revenue. It's about – roughly about that, and that's about most of it. So if I take a snapshot of what the business is looking like at the start of the year, versus the end of last year, and give you a little bit of an update on where we are on our seasonal cycle in terms of aftermarket, and if I were to take out the effects of some of the audits and some of the systems, the programs we have implementing in the business, could be slightly better condition for – so I probably let Ron cover a lot more of those, but I would say so far pretty much as we'd expected. So far pretty much, so good. I'll let Ron cover some more on the end of that peculiarities. Thanks, Chris, for that question. Yeah, let me try and give you some color around that Jamie. So first of all those bookings for us. If you remember, back in Investor Day we said pretty proudly that last year we won all those 19 awards on hybrids and electric programs. And as I mentioned, that's now up in the mid-20s, in terms of numbers today, so we're winning a whole lot of business in that space. And fundamentally that's double all partially and that would be in hybrid and electric after that quite as much as the absolute numbers in terms of bookings and wins in the hybrid and electric space versus those which are combustion. So we're seeing big wins for us. And we're seeing that also playing out in profitability in terms of what we're booking, which is very good to see. So we're winning very well. Thanks Jamie. Let me take a shot and give you a little bit of color on it. So obviously I think when you think about that Q4 performing into – and I think one of the things we're particularly paying a lot of attention to at BorgWarner in the first quarter is the mature cycle in North America. We've got to see how inventories and schedules transpire as the year goes on. So we will keep a very close eye on the inventory levels as the year unfolds. But we see really strong consumer and business digital that have driven out. If you look at what we did to last year, to strengthen the suite in – there are financials in the Q4 -- so our growth came toward the high end of our guidance range and I think full year 2016 was very solid. And meeting all of our operating performance, I've said earlier to you that the chart showing this sales in Q4 versus how I did versus the actual instead of 3.6%, which is pretty good. But, regionally, it was pretty much as we expected. So I feel – so in terms of our – our engine segment the strength carries on in the – so the industry strength into the following year, so we're feeling very good about that, add to that the investor day program and new business program, and as I said at the start, our view is very, very comfortable in terms of getting to that mid to high org nice organic growth level, and we feel very comfortable in terms of getting there and that gives us confidence we're going to keep bringing that to you. So, we're feeling pretty good. I hope it gives you a little color, but I think in terms of the financial recap, and I think as we clean on that, running through the guidance we should detail to you and what we said in Detroit, as I said early I gave you a little guide of the view into 2016. Thanks, Paul. I can take a shot at that question. So earlier, we talked about maybe a couple of key focus on hybrid programs for us in 2017. So the first one is even with that little bit of a shift last year, we had about 2% down shift in the mix between diesel and gas. I was saying last year, I really expect the penetration to continue to decline vs. diesel share of western Europe. I think that would continue 2017. Impacting obviously, our diesel position, could be impact on our growth from that end, so we're starting to see that into the first quarter and into the full year, but I would say that growth is – the numbers are probably still in line with what we'd expect – better than what we expect on a full year basis. And then I think the third aspect would probably be China, where we're always expecting modest growth in their country and are we're expecting this year, but the signs are encouraging so far, and that's kind of what I would say that we're trying to keep our eye on more and more even said in the from of to the fourth view compared over the years and just identify the whole. Thanks, Paul, for that question. And I would say it's – it's feeling good, we're sustaining the growth will be of a year. We're feeling pretty comfortable and saying that. Thanks, Paul. I can take a shot at that, Blake. So let me give you a little bit of a color around that. So obviously, we talked about the continuation of the strong pull for advanced technology whether from a regulatory or technology or investment thing of view and we continue to have a very strong drive around fuel economy and emissions regulation and the pull for commercial and powertrains technology, so I don't see any change on that. No backing off says give us a succinctly no move and we continue to believe that that we're very strongly positioned in that space. And so give a little bit of color about how that's evolved and say, a good thing is it looked over the last three years and even in the last quarter. I talked a little bit about this earlier on the call, and we continue to see very robust quoting activity. We receive new awards in all three categories and that's propulsion systems, so I would say pretty much business as usual. I think the numbers back me too. We have alluded to together at the Investor Day, last year and – and – the last 35 years, could have had about 19 awards as a company, and widening, I think all of us on this call feel well, we have supplemented that with the awards wins even more. We feel we are – component and customer focused in our wins and I think our approach as we go forward will continue to be a – a focus on serving customers and continuing to have that strong pull for advanced technology from a combustion, through hybrid, to electric vehicle technology. And that really seems to play out well for us. So, honestly, no change, it's playing out exactly as we expect. Thanks, Blake. Good afternoon, Jim. I can take a shot at that. So we are in a pretty healthy environment and operating from auto perspective. We continue to see strong outperformance. Just a reminder, we're sitting in a pretty good environment from an auto perspective, about close to 94 million light vehicles produced this year. Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, Kyle. So thanks for that question. I would say the first thing before – if I can pick a couple of color around that with – maybe it's a lot of presenters that brings together that's somewhat the same messaging from – it was from last quarter and it's feeling pretty good doing everything before the outlook as on it, but as I said, we are continuing to feel strong growth projected for 2017 on a patient level of the contents of the demand for our products and what we're seeing in releases, but we simply feel really, really strong in that space. And as I said it 200,000 numbers from already wins contracts, we –, so we – that's a really good position for us. So we feel good where we are at right now and where we are heading. And – and we think that's – that's a really good place for us and we think we are tracking as we would expect and we'll go on from there and – and stick to the guidance that we've provided. Thanks, Kyle.							
33. As a financial analyst, what are your key insights and the financial metrics that you would base your 'underweight' investment stance on? Some of the key insights and financial metrics supporting the 'underweight' investment stance include uncertainty in the political and economic environment globally, particularly in Europe, the U.S., and China. The company's reliance on North America for about 25% of its revenue and potential impact from border taxes and NAFTA renegotiations. The company's strong focus on electric and hybrid vehicle technology, with a shift away from diesel, which could impact profitability. The company's investments in advanced propulsion technology and historical growth performance also support a balanced approach to evaluating the investment stance. Additionally, the company's margin performance, operating income, and guidance for organic growth and EPS provide important financial metrics for analysis.
