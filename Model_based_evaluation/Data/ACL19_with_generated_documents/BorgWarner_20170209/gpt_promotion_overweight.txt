. And Ron will give you a lot more detail on that. We've done a little bit of room there that we're continuing to focus on, and then if I talk about Remy, if anything, I would say we're optimistic that we'll get a couple points of margin uplift. So I don't think those will necessarily converge. We think those are pretty stable, those gaps are going to be pretty stable, if that's helpful. Let me take a shot at that, Chris. I would say the R&D spending is in a couple of different places. So the first emphasis is the majority of that is still around hybrids, electrics and new combustion technology, so those areas we are still spending money on. The two examples I alluded to a little bit earlier, electric drive module you know that's – it's coming to market pretty soon. Another part of that spending is still there's some refining around turbos to support hybrids, we've got some new turbo technologies to support hybrids. Gasoline direct injection with new regulations or new refining and new evolutions around gasoline direct injection. So we are spending some R&D money in those spaces. And then separately, you know the focus is obviously around the battery, Chris. And so we've got battery work going on as well, and the final point I would say, we are subsaving and we have substantial R&D around our manufacturing. So even though we're spending the same or more dollars than we were, I would argue it's a different mix. It's away from what does it take to meet the next emission? How do you support this new gasoline technology? How do you get fuel economy to something different? How do you get power density with a turbo in a hybrid and evolve to what do I need out of a new battery? And then how do I make that in a very high quantity manner across our footprint. So call it evolution, if you want to call it that, but it's just a different emphasis how we're spending the research dollar. So I don't – at this point, Chris, I don't see a fundamental change. We saw the same thing, the negative mix, again folding out, but the positive mix really did overcome that. So, fundamentally, we've got the same fundamentals in place as we did entering the year, and we feel pretty comfortable that we can continue to deliver what we said we're going to do. Thanks, Chris. I would just say a couple of things about China on market outlook in 2017. So if you look at light vehicle perspective, our view is very much aligned and similar to IHS's view. So we're seeing 1% to 2% growth projection for China and also for those hybrid compositions. We have a lot of fuelled forward for 2017. And we feel good about our position. We feel well-positioned around this, so that's our market position. Thanks, Dan. And good afternoon, everyone. I don't want to open with a few comments on the quarter and a wrapup. So I would say if I look back at this quarter of the full-year, fulfillment of our commitments, a really good year of delivery in the market and the business performance, and we're confident and solid about our positions in these important key technology areas and advancing the growth for the company. And certainly, one thing we're very positive about in our winning strategy of advanced propulsion technology for combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles. We look forward to keeping a strong eye on M&A and see how that evolves for us. So with that, let me turn the call over to you. Thanks, Dan. And Brett, do you want to read the next question?

Based on the recent earnings call, it is clear that the company has a strong foothold in the market and has a very well-balanced position in the uncertain global economic environment. The company's emphasis on advanced propulsion technology for combustion, hybrid, and electric vehicles is a positive indicator for future growth. The management team is confident in the company's growth prospects and is focusing on executing strong short-term performance while also planning for long-term growth.

In summary, the recent earnings call reinforces the company's position as a leader in the industry and provides a compelling case for an 'overweight' investment stance. The positive momentum in key technology areas, strong financial performance, and focused approach to future growth all support this recommendation.
