. And I think that's the big reason why I think we approach the Engine and Drivetrain projections somewhat conservatively, because we know we're in the mid to high teens in Engine and we can push the margin profile more in Drivetrain. So I feel good that it's playing out pretty much as I expected and we believe we can continue to drive some incremental improvement there. So I feel good about how the margin plays out on that.

In terms of normalization of inventory levels, I think we're keeping an eye on it. We've seen good progress on it thus far, both in the U.S. and globally. We're seeing the adjustments being made to schedules and patterns. We believe it's very manageable and we're keeping a close eye on it as we go into the year. But so far, so good. We believe we can manage it as we go forward.

Yeah, the mix shift away from diesel in Europe is also something we have been monitoring closely. We saw a bit of a downshift last year and we have taken that into consideration in our projections and plans going forward. We expect to see a continued decline in diesel share in Western Europe, but we have been able to offset that with other growth areas. We believe we are well-positioned to continue to navigate through these market shifts.

As for China, we are cautiously optimistic about the market there. We are closely monitoring the signs and so far, we are seeing encouraging early signs of growth coming off the Chinese New Year. We continue to keep a close eye on the market as it unfolds. Overall, I think we are well-prepared to handle the market dynamics and are confident in our growth projections for the year.

I hope that gives you a better understanding of how we are approaching the market and our growth outlook. Let me know if you have any further questions.
