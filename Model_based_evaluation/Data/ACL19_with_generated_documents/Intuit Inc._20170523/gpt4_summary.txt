In the third fiscal quarter, the company delivered strong financial results, which are particularly noteworthy considering it is the company's largest quarter. Notable financial highlights include:

1. **Consumer Tax Revenue**: Revenue in this segment increased by 9% year-to-date, aligning with expectations to finish at the high end of the guidance range for the fiscal year. Despite challenges such as a late start to the tax filing season and intensified competition, the Consumer Tax business maintained robust performance, with revenue enhanced by a shift towards higher-end products.

2. **QuickBooks Online (QBO) Subscriber Growth**: Subscribers for QuickBooks Online grew an impressive 59%, reaching over 2.2 million subscribersâ€”surpassing the upper target for the fiscal year. As a result, the company raised its subscriber outlook to 2.3 million. Notably, the launch of QuickBooks Online in new geographies like Singapore, with plans for Hong Kong and South Africa, highlights a successful expansion strategy.

3. **ProConnect Performance**: Exceeding expectations, this segment reported a year-to-date revenue growth of 2%. ProConnect supports approximately 60% of the interactions via TurboTax SmartLook, demonstrating its crucial role within the company's ecosystem.

4. **TurboTax Self-Employed**: This offering contributed approximately 160,000 subscribers to the total QuickBooks Self-Employed subscribers. Integration of tax services with self-employed business tools indicates successful cross-selling that leverages the growing gig economy.

5. **Online Ecosystem Revenue**: Continued strong performance with a 30% growth this quarter, positioned at the high end of the 25% to 30% target range, propelled largely by QBO subscriber increases and expansion of service offerings.

6. **Revenue and EPS Guidance**: The company has revised its full-year revenue guidance upwards and tightened the EPS range towards the higher end, reflecting a positive revenue and profit outlook.

7. **Innovative Initiatives**: Significant investments in innovation, including over 100 patents applied for and more than 30 AI applications launched across the company, are illustrative of a robust strategy to maintain competitive advantage and adapt to evolving market demands.

8. **Broader Strategic Outlook**: The ongoing efforts include expanding the leadership in DIY tax categories and transforming assisted tax services along with making inroads beyond traditional tax services through an open platform approach.

9. **Challenges and Opportunities**: While the total number of IRS filings saw a slight decline, the company managed to increase its market share in the DIY category and improve revenue per return, benefiting from stable pricing and favorable product mix.

The momentum across both the Consumer Tax and Small Business segments, facilitated by strategic innovations and market expansion, positions the company to potentially exceed its revised full-year targets.
