, and let's keep the momentum going. Thank you. Now, to summarize my report, it is clear that the company has had a strong quarter, with excellent financial results, particularly in the Consumer Tax and Small Business segments. The company's focus on driving transformation and innovation in its tax and accounting products has paid off, leading to accelerated growth in QBO subscribers and strong momentum in revenue. The company's efforts to reach self-employed individuals have been successful, with the TurboTax channel driving significant growth in QuickBooks Self-Employed subscribers. Overall, the company is positioning itself as the leader in the do-it-yourself tax category and is driving strong progress for the One Intuit Ecosystem strategy. In light of these developments, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company's stocks, as I believe the company's growth prospects are strong and its strategic initiatives are driving substantial value for its customers and shareholders.
