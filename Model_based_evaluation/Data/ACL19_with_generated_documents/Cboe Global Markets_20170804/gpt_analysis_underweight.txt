Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, the future outlook for CBOE Holdings is cautiously optimistic. The company reported strong quarterly results with significant growth in proprietary index products. The increase in options volume, particularly in VIX trading, and the success in attracting notable ETF listings demonstrate positive momentum. Additionally, the collaboration with Gemini Trust Company to create bitcoin derivatives products and the expansion of the European equities business in light of MiFID II regulations further indicate potential growth opportunities.

However, despite these positive developments, it is important to consider the impact of low volatility environments on trading opportunities. The company acknowledges the challenges posed by continued low volatility, particularly in the U.S. and European equities markets. The potential impact of low volatility on trading strategies and market dynamics should be taken into account when considering future performance.

Furthermore, the integration with Bats and the migration of trading technology onto Bats' platform presents an opportunity to cross-sell additional products and services to an expanded customer base. The success of this integration will be crucial in realizing revenue synergies and effectively leveraging the extended global reach of the company.

In conclusion, while there are positive indicators of growth and innovation, the company should remain cautious in its approach to future investments. The impact of low volatility on trading volumes and the successful integration with Bats should be closely monitored to determine the overall investment stance towards CBOE Holdings. Therefore, an 'underweight' investment stance is recommended based on the analysis of key insights and financial metrics derived from the recent earnings conference call transcript.
