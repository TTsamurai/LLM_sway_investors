Based on the recent earnings call from CBOE Holdings, it appears that the company has achieved strong performance in the second quarter of 2017. However, there are several aspects of the company's performance and future plans that may warrant a cautious or skeptical perspective, leading to a recommendation of an 'underweight' investment stance.

First, despite the company's strong quarterly results, including a net revenue of $267 million and a record quarter in VIX trading, the remarks made regarding the low volatility environment are a cause for concern. The reliance on increased VIX trading amidst low volatility raises questions about the sustainability of the company's growth in this area.

Additionally, the expansion of the company's ETF marketplace and the announcement of an agreement with Gemini Trust Company to create bitcoin derivatives products may be viewed as taking on new ventures in an uncertain market. This could raise concerns about the company's ability to successfully navigate and capitalize on the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency and ETF markets.

Furthermore, the company's focus on cross-selling additional products and services to an expanded customer base, as well as the integration with Bats and the opening of a satellite office in Hong Kong, may signal a significant amount of resources being allocated to these initiatives. This could potentially divert attention and resources away from the core index business and impact the company's ability to deliver on its strategic growth initiatives.

Finally, the delay in the SEC's review of the Bats market close proposal and the potential impact of MiFID II on the European equities business could introduce regulatory and operational challenges that may affect the company's performance and market position.

In conclusion, although CBOE Holdings has demonstrated strong performance in the second quarter of 2017, the company's focus on new ventures, potential resource allocation concerns, and regulatory challenges may warrant a cautious or skeptical perspective. It is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance in light of these considerations.
