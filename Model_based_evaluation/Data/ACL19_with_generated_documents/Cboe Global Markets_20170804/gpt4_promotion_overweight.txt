**Report on the Investment Stance for CBOE Holdings**

**Overview:**

The recent earnings call for CBOE Holdings has further solidified our conviction in recommending an 'overweight' investment stance on the company's stock. The strong performance across multiple business lines, especially the proprietary products and strategic expansions, underpin our optimistic outlook, indicating robust growth potential and solid financial health. 

**Strengthened Financial Indicators:**

CBOE Holdings reported an exceptionally strong quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $0.87 and a net revenue of $267 million. This growth is largely attributable to a significant upsurge in its proprietary index products. The overall options volume has seen a 15% increase year-over-year, with an outstanding 19% rise in VIX trading compared to the previous year. This exceptional performance, particularly in VIX options, which had their busiest month of the year in July, underscores CBOE's capacity to capitalize on varying market conditions, including low volatility environments.

**Expansion and Diversification:**

The diversification into ETFs and ETPs has notably augmented CBOE's market scope. With new listings, including 30 BlackRock iShares funds and the introduction of its first exchange-traded notes, CBOE now hosts over 221 ETFs. This expansion, achieving a record 39% of all new ETF listings year-to-date, not only broadens CBOEâ€™s product offerings but also enhances its market share and investor appeal.

The collaboration with Gemini Trust Company to launch bitcoin derivatives is an insightful move into the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. As a market front-runner, this venture not only diversifies CBOE's product line but also leverages its data analytics capability, potentially increasing its competitive edge in the financial data sector.

**Operational Efficiency and Strategic Future Steps:**

CBOE's integration with Bats has been executed seamlessly, bringing additional cross-sell opportunities and technological advancements. The migration of trading technology to Bats' platform promises enhanced scale and efficiency, which is expected to come to fruition with the completion of the C2 options exchange migration by May 14, 2018.

**Regulatory and Market Positioning:**

The successful adaptation to regulatory changes, specifically MiFID II in Europe, illustrates CBOE's proactive and efficient approach to compliance and innovation. This readiness not only positions CBOE as a reliable trading venue but also enhances its capability to offer value-added products and services, thereby fostering stronger client relationships and opening doors to new market segments.

**Recommendation:**

Given CBOE Holdings' superior performance in the second quarter, strategic positioning for future growth, and steady advancements in both operational technology and product diversification, we strongly recommend an 'overweight' investment stance. The company's ability to innovate and adapt to market and regulatory changes presents a promising avenue for robust growth and profitability. By capitalizing on emerging trends and strengthening its market presence globally, CBOE is poised to deliver value to investors seeking long-term growth and stability in their portfolios.
