Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, there are several key insights and financial metrics that support an 'overweight' investment stance for CBOE Holdings. The company reported strong quarterly results, with adjusted earnings per share of $0.87 and a net revenue of $267 million, driven by continued growth in proprietary index products. Overall options volume during the second quarter was up 15% over the previous year, with an all-time record quarter in VIX trading, which increased 19% over the second quarter of the previous year. The company also established an all-time record quarter in VIX options trading and saw continued growth in SPX options volume.

Additionally, the company's global FX volume was up 8% in the second quarter, with a market share of 12.9% at the end of June, compared to 11.5% a year ago. CBOEâ€™s ETF marketplace continues to thrive and grow, with over 221 ETFs listed, including some of the largest ETF launches this year. The company also entered into an agreement with Gemini Trust Company to create bitcoin derivatives products, subject to regulatory review, and intends to offer trading and cash-settled bitcoin futures on CFE in the fourth quarter of 2017 or early 2018. 

Furthermore, the company is focused on integrating with Bats and leveraging the combined company to cross-sell additional products and services to an expanded customer base. They are targeting the OTC space with quality listed products while extending their global reach to promote an expanded product line.

Based on these insights and financial metrics derived from the company's recent earnings conference call transcript, an 'overweight' investment stance can be justified as CBOE Holdings continues to demonstrate strong growth and expansion in its core business lines, as well as strategic initiatives to expand its product line and global reach. Additionally, the company's focus on integration and cross-selling opportunities presents further growth potential for the future.
