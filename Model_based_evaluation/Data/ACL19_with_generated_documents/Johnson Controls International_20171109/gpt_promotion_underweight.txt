Based on the recent earnings call, there are a few key points that indicate a cautious or skeptical perspective on Johnson Controls. The overall decline in sales, particularly in the North American market, suggests a potential weakness in the company's core business. The decline in large projects within the solutions business, especially in North America, is particularly concerning as it may indicate a slowdown in demand from key customers, such as the U.S. federal government. Additionally, the impact of hurricanes and the earthquake in Mexico, as well as final sales-related purchase accounting adjustments, has negatively affected sales growth.

In addition, the decline in Power Solutions' margins, especially due to the significant headwind from lead, is a cause for concern. The spike in lead prices and its impact on margins, as well as the ongoing product investments, start-up and launch costs, and increased logistics and distribution costs, present challenges for the company in maintaining profitability.

Furthermore, the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. tax reform proposal and its potential impact on the company's effective tax rate adds to the cautious outlook. The limitations on interest deductibility and repatriation taxes on foreign earnings could put pressure on the company's effective tax rate. The implications of these proposals and the potential tax planning opportunities are uncertain, posing risks for investors.

Overall, the recent earnings call for Johnson Controls suggests challenges and uncertainties that warrant a cautious or skeptical perspective. It is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance based on the company's performance and the potential risks and challenges outlined in the earnings call.
