Based on the recent earnings conference call transcript, Johnson Controls appears to be facing challenges in their Building Solutions segment and Power Solutions segment. In the Building Solutions segment, sales declined in North America due to weaker sales to the U.S. federal government and a decline in large projects. In Asia Pacific, lower project installation spend, particularly in China, offset strong service growth. In the Power Solutions segment, the impact of lead price increases and logistics and distribution costs resulted in a decline in margins. Additionally, changes in tax laws in Mexico are expected to result in cash outflows of $200 million in the first quarter of fiscal ‘18.

Despite cost synergies and productivity savings, Johnson Controls reported that their earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA) margins for both the Building Solutions and Power Solutions segments declined year-over-year. Challenges in the global market are expected to have an impact on the company's effective tax rate, cash flow, and investment obligations in fiscal ‘18 and ‘19. The company also reported significant onetime cash outflows of $800 million to $900 million related to integration, restructuring, and income tax payments. This suggests financial instability and potential long-term challenges for the company.

Based on these findings, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for Johnson Controls. The company is facing challenges in their key segments, and the impact of tax law changes and onetime cash outflows are expected to affect the company's financial performance in the near future. Additionally, the decline in EBITA margins and cash flow challenges are concerning. Therefore, it is advisable to approach Johnson Controls with caution as an investment opportunity.
