Based on the information provided, the company seems to have faced multiple challenges during the third quarter, including weather events, plant shutdowns, and competition in the market. While the company showed revenue growth in various segments, it is important to note that much of this growth was impacted by external events such as hurricane Harvey and floods in Northern Mexico. Additionally, the company expects solid performance in Q4 to fill the demand created by the surge in sales due to hurricanes and floods, which might not be sustainable in the long term.

Furthermore, the CFO mentioned that truck rates in Mexico remain low, making it a competitive market. Additionally, the pricing environment in the refined products market has stabilized, and the company expects inflation plus pricing on both sides of the border. 

The company anticipates that the investments in infrastructure and terminals, particularly in Mexico, will drive growth in the refined products and LPG business. However, it is unclear how quickly this growth will ramp up, and much of it depends on new retailers entering the market, distributor infrastructure, and port facilities.

Considering the various challenges and uncertainties mentioned, it is prudent to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. The company's growth may be hindered by external factors beyond its control, such as adverse weather events and market competition. Additionally, the ramp-up in the company's growth may take time, which could impact its financial performance in the near term. Therefore, caution should be exercised when considering an investment in the company.
