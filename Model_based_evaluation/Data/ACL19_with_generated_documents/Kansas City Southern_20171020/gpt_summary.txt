Key financial metrics for the third quarter include a 9% year-over-year revenue growth, with volumes increasing by 3%. However, these numbers were negatively impacted by weather events in Texas and Northern Mexico. Despite this, same-store sales and in-quarter renewals pricing both came in at a solid 3%. The Chemical & Petroleum business saw a growth of 10%, driven by strong performance in the longer length of haul southbound LPG business, as well as the lubes and oils segment.

The Industrial & Consumer business also showed improvement with a revenue growth of 9% and a volume increase of 4%, driven by strength in military shipments and positive performance in the metals business. The automotive business saw a significant increase of 19% over 2016, primarily due to growth in manufacturing capacity as new model launches took effect.

The energy business posted over 100% revenue growth in both frac sand and crude oil, driving an overall year-over-year revenue increase of 19% for the total energy business. The Intermodal revenue and volume increases improved to 4%, partly due to new business and new cross-border services. The Agriculture & Minerals segment saw a 2% increase in revenue, primarily driven by grain demand. Despite the impact from flooding, the strong harvest for the fourth quarter is expected to continue the strength in the ag and minerals business.

Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the company expects continued growth in the cross-border service offerings to drive improvement in the intermodal business. Additionally, growth is anticipated in the Chemical & Petroleum segment due to additional refined product shipments and strengthening in the plastics market. The Agriculture & Minerals segment is expected to see a slightly lower growth rate, while the Industrial & Consumer segment anticipates moderate year-over-year growth in metals and paper.

The automotive business may face challenging year-over-year comps due to changes in plant shutdown schedules, but strong growth is still expected for the total year. The energy business is expected to see continued strong performance, particularly in crude oil and frac sand shipments. The company also announced planned investments in refined products terminals near Monterey Mexico, demonstrating a commitment to creating quality facilities in critical markets to provide rail service in growing refined products markets in Mexico.

In terms of pricing, the company expects a relatively positive and strong pricing environment, anticipating inflation plus on both sides of the border. The company is also focused on expanding its market share, particularly in the Mexican market, with significant upside in converting freight from the road to the rail. The LPG business, which experienced a quick start, is expected to continue growing, along with the refined products market.

The company is also optimistic about the potential impact of retail distribution in 2018 and beyond, with expectations of significant volume increases in off-port and rail line shipments. The automotive business is expected to remain positive, despite potential changes in plant schedules and part and content from NAFTA renegotiations. The company is also focused on taking advantage of opportunities in crude by rail and is investing in infrastructure to ensure long-term sustainable growth.

Overall, the company is strategically positioned to capitalize on market opportunities and remains focused on investing in infrastructure to ensure fluidity and capacity to take advantage of future growth. The financial outlook looks positive, with a focus on driving sustainable long-term growth in key market segments.
