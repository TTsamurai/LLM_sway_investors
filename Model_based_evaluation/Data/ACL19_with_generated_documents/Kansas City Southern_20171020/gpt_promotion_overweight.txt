As a stock promoter, after analyzing the recent earnings call of the company, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance. The company has shown strong performance in the third quarter, with year-over-year revenue up 9% and volume up 3%. Despite the negative impact of weather events in Texas and Mexico, the company's Chemical & Petroleum business saw growth of 10%, driven by solid performance in the LPG business and lubes and oils. The Industrial & Consumer business also showed improvement with 9% revenue growth and 4% increase in volume.

The energy business saw over 100% revenue growth in both frac sand and crude oil, driving overall year-over-year revenue increase of 19%. The automotive business also saw strong growth of 19% driven by growth in manufacturing capacity and increased demand for replacement cars and trucks in areas impacted by hurricanes.

In addition, the company has announced planned investments in a new storage and distribution terminal in Mexico, demonstrating commitment to growing markets. The company is also strategically located to serve major population centers and growth areas not close to existing pipelines, giving them a significant foothold in new and developing infrastructure.

The company's intermodal business is positioned well to deal with competition and is expected to see solid growth in major cross-border service offerings. The Agriculture & Minerals line of business also expects to see continued strength, with a strong grain harvest for the fourth quarter.

The company's investments in refined products terminal in Mexico are anticipated to drive significant growth, and they are well positioned to take advantage of the growth in the automotive and energy sectors.

Overall, the company's strong performance, strategic investments, and position in growing markets make it a compelling investment opportunity with potential for significant future growth. Therefore, an 'overweight' investment stance is recommended for this company based on the recent earnings call.
