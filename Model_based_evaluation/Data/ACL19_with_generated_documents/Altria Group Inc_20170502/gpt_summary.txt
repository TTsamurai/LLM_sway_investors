As per the recent earnings conference call transcripts, the key financial metrics are as follows:

- Adjusted OCI margins for the smokeable products segment expanded by 2.9 percentage points in the first quarter to 51%, driven by higher net pricing and lower resolution expenses. 
- Cigarette shipment volume for smokeable products declined 2.7% in the quarter, with PM USA estimating its cigarette volume declined approximately 3%. 
- PM USA's first quarter retail share was 51%, down 0.1 share point, and Marlboro's retail share declined by 0.2 share point to 43.6%. 
- Adjusted OCI margins for the smokeless products segment decreased by 3.6 percentage points to 61.9%, driven principally by the Recall impact, partially offset by higher pricing. 
- USSTC's smokeless shipment volume decreased by 5% in the quarter. 
- Michelle's adjusted OCI was 25% lower than last year at $21 million, with margins contracting by 4.6 percentage points to 15.4% due to lower volume and higher cost. 
- Altria's reported equity earnings from its investment in ABI were $23 million in the quarter, including net pre-tax charges of $73 million for ABI special items.

Additionally, Altria paid nearly $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchased over $550 million in shares in the quarter. The company has approximately $1.4 billion remaining in the current $3 billion share repurchase program and expects to complete this program by the end of the second quarter of 2018. Altria also expects higher adjusted diluted earnings growth in the second half of 2017 due to the financial effect of USSTC's Recall and the benefit of reporting four full quarters of equity income from its ABI investment.

In terms of market share reporting, historical trends of restated numbers are generally consistent with those under IRI's previously reported numbers, as per IRI's most recent database restatement.

There were also discussions on the impact of the recall on share recovery, guidance reaffirmation, and the company's strategy and approach in the cigar category.
