#### Key Financial Metrics and Performance Highlights:

1. **Smokeable Products Segment:**
   - **Adjusted Operating Company Income (OCI) Margins:** Expanded by 2.9 percentage points to 51% in Q1, attributed primarily to higher net pricing and lower resolution expenses.
   - **Cigarette Shipment Volume:** Reported a decline of 2.7%. Adjusted for trade inventory movements and other factors, PM USA’s volume declined by 3%, aligning with the estimated industry decline rate.
   - **Market Share:** PM USA’s retail share stood at 51%, slight decline of 0.1 share point. Marlboro’s retail share experienced a 0.2 share point decrease to 43.6%.

2. **Smokeless Products Segment:**
   - **Adjusted OCI Margins:** Decreased by 3.6 percentage points to 61.9% due to the recall impact, though partially offset by higher pricing.
   - **Shipment Volume:** Down by 5% in the quarter, impacted by the recall.
   - **Market Growth:** Industry volume grew by approximately 2% over the past six months.

3. **Wine Segment:**
   - **Adjusted OCI:** Reported at $21 million, a 25% decrease from the previous year.
   - **Margins:** Contracted by 4.6 percentage points to 15.4%, due to lower volume and higher costs.
   - **Volume Drivers:** Decrease driven by wholesalers reducing year-end inventory and timing of the Easter holiday.

4. **Beer Investment (ABI):**
   - **Equity Earnings:** Altria's reported equity earnings from ABI were $23 million for the quarter, including net pre-tax charges of $73 million for special items.
   - **Performance Factors:** Negatively impacted by a challenging environment in Brazil and mark-to-market losses related to ABI’s share-based compensation payment programs.

5. **Capital Return to Shareholders:**
   - **Dividends:** Paid nearly $1.2 billion in the quarter.
   - **Share Repurchases:** Over $550 million in shares repurchased as of Q1.
   - **Share Repurchase Program:** Approximately $1.4 billion remaining from the current $3 billion program, expected to complete by Q2 2018.

6. **Forward Guidance:**
   - **2017 Adjusted Diluted Earnings Growth:** Anticipated to be higher in the second half, mainly due to the financial effect of the USSTC’s Recall this quarter and the benefit of reporting four full quarters of equity income from ABI investments.

#### Operational Challenges and Mitigation:
- **Recall Impact:** The recall in the smokeless segment significantly impacted shipment volumes and margins. Recovery efforts are ongoing, with promising signs of share recovery.
- **Cigarette SET Implementation:** The new cigarette SET in California, effective from April 1, is expected to impact shipment volumes short-term.

#### Market Strategy and Outlook:
- **Smokeable Market:** Continuation of efforts to stabilize market share amidst industry declines.
- **Cigar Category Strategy:** Altria continues to focus on the profitable "tipped" segment of cigars, where they hold significantly large market share, while not actively competing in low-profit portions like the "un-tipped" segment.

#### Additional Notes:
- **IRI's Restatements:** Updates regarding restatement of cigarette and smokeless retail market shares by IRI were addressed, noting consistent historical trends with previously reported numbers.
