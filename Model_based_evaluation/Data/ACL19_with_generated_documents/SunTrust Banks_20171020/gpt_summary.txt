. We are seeing a lot of success with this and are planning to continue investing in technology to improve the efficiency of our operations. On the interest margin, we are expecting a decline of one to three basis points next quarter due to expected rate environment changes. However, we expect some expansion in NIM as the short-end of the curve continues to rise.

In terms of expenses, we have seen stability relative to the prior quarter, with several legacy legal matters being resolved and resulting in significant reversal of legal accruals. However, this was offset by discrete charges such as elevated severance accrual and write-down of certain software related assets.

Regarding asset quality metrics, our ALLL ratio increased by 3 basis points due to anticipated hurricane losses. We expect a modest uptick in NPLs and charge-offs over the next several quarters as a result of the hurricanes.

Our segment reviews show that our consumer segment is delivering healthy business and revenue momentum, driven by strong loan and deposit growth, as well as continued improvements in loan mix. In the wholesale segment, we delivered record quarterly revenue and net income, largely due to strong markets conditions and continued strategic momentum with our clients.

In conclusion, our efforts in efficiency initiatives and investments in technology across both consumer and commercial segments are showing progress and improving our overall operating leverage. We are also anticipating the impact of expected rate hikes and hurricane losses on our financial metrics over the near term. We remain optimistic about our growth opportunities and are well positioned to meet our clients' needs.
