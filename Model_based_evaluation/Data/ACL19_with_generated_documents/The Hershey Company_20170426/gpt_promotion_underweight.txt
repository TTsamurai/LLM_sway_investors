 market, trade expense in Q1 was down as the company made different decisions regarding trade and advertising. The company is planning to increase advertising expense in the back part of the year to drive acceleration of everyday business. The company has seen strong growth in indulgent categories and is focused on strategic revenue growth management to maximize net price realization. The company has also experienced strong growth in international markets such as Mexico, Brazil, and India, but has underperformed the market in China. The company is undergoing a Margin for Growth Program in China to reset investments and focus on a profitable mix of brands. Additionally, the company has seen strong growth in e-commerce in China. Overall, the company is focused on expanding margins and investing in capabilities to drive balanced top and bottom-line growth and build shareholder value.

However, the cautious or skeptical perspective on the company's recent earnings call suggests that while the company has seen some success in international markets and indulgent categories, they have underperformed in the U.S. market, particularly in non-seasonal CMG retail takeaway, resulting in Q1 net sales coming in less than their plan. The softness in Q1 marketplace performance across most U.S. food group categories and the continuation of challenges such as benefits inflation and channel shifting are also causes for concern. The uncertainty regarding overall U.S. brick-and-mortar retail trends has led the company to lower its full-year U.S. net sales growth rate. Additionally, the underperformance of the company's non-chocolate sweets and non-core portfolio suggests a need to fix their execution in that area. The company's underperformance in China and the need to reset investments and focus on a more profitable mix of brands indicate potential challenges and uncertainties in the international markets.

In conclusion, the company's solid performance in international markets and indulgent categories is overshadowed by underperformance in the U.S. market, challenges in the non-chocolate sweets and non-core portfolio, and the need to reset investments in China. Therefore, a cautious or skeptical stance on the company's potential for growth and value creation may lead to a recommendation of an 'underweight' investment stance.
