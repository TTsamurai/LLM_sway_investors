. Thank you for providing the transcripts. Based on the information provided, I am confident in recommending an 'overweight' investment stance on The Hershey Company. The company's first quarter results show solid net sales growth of 2.8% and a strong start to the year with adjusted EPS of $1.31. The Margin for Growth Program is on track, which is expected to fuel higher levels of advertising and brand building initiatives. Additionally, market share for core power brands, including Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat, Kisses, and Ice Breakers, increased by 0.4 points. 

In terms of international markets, constant currency net sales in Mexico, Brazil, and India show promising growth, with strong performance and market share gains in these regions. The company is also focused on improving global efficiency and effectiveness through the Margin for Growth Program in China.

The company's strategic initiatives include new product launches such as Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch, Reese's Cookies 'n' Cr√®me Crunchers, and Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cup, all aimed at capturing broader snacking occasions. The company's focus on growth, innovation, consumer spending, and investment in the confectionery category aligns with positive market trends and consumer behavior.

Given the company's commitment to expanding margins, reallocating resources to high-return initiatives, and leveraging core power brands, I believe The Hershey Company has a long runway for future growth and is well-positioned to deliver on its financial commitments. Therefore, I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance on the company.
