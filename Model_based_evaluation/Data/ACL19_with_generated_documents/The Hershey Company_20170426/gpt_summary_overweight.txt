The Hershey Company's first quarter results indicate solid performance, with net sales growth of 2.8% and a strong start to the year with adjusted EPS of $1.31. Gross margin is expected to increase for the full year, leading to higher levels of advertising and brand building initiatives. The Margin for Growth Program is on track and expected to drive margin and EPS growth in 2018 and 2019, positioning the company for consistent annual net sales and EPS growth post-implementation.

Preliminary analysis of Easter data shows a good season for Hershey, with retail takeaway expected to be about 2.5%. Market share increased by 0.4 points in the first quarter, and core power brands like Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat, Kisses, and Ice Breakers continue to perform well, with a 5.6% increase in non-seasonal retail takeaway.

However, first quarter net sales came in less than planned due to softer non-seasonal retail takeaway, reflecting the overall softness in the U.S. food group marketplace. The company remains focused on improving market trends and expects a rebound in the back half of the year.

In the international segment, net sales were essentially in line with the plan, with strong performance in Mexico, Brazil, and India. The company is implementing the Margin for Growth Program in China to optimize manufacturing operations and streamline the operating model.

Overall, The Hershey Company has a long runway ahead and is focused on expanding margins, investing in capabilities, and leveraging core power brands to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth. The company is well-positioned to capture new usage occasions and drive sustainable operating models in international markets.

As a financial analyst, the company's focus on innovation, consumer spending, and investment in the confectionery category, along with its international growth prospects, leads to an 'overweight' investment stance. The solid financial metrics and the company's strategic initiatives indicate strong potential for future growth and shareholder value.
