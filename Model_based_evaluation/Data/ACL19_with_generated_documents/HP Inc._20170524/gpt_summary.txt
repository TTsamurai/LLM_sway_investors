Cathie Lesjak, Chief Financial Officer of HP, Inc., presented key financial metrics in the recent earnings conference call. The company delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.40, at the high end of the outlook range. Net revenue grew by 7% year-over-year to $12.4 billion, driven by growth in Personal Systems and Print. Free cash flow for the quarter was approximately $400 million, and $1.1 billion for the first half of the fiscal year. Additionally, HP returned approximately $1.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In the Personal Systems segment, revenue grew by 10% year-over-year, with market share expanding to 21.7% globally and regaining the number one PC market position. The Print segment saw revenue growth of 2% year-over-year, with both hardware and supplies revenue growing in the same quarter for the first time since Q2 of 2011. Operating profit expansion was also achieved in the Print segment. The Graphics business delivered another strong performance with balanced hardware revenue growth and growth in contractual printing. Additionally, momentum in the 3D printing business was demonstrated through product shipments and strategic milestones. HP's acquisition of Samsung's printing business is expected to further accelerate its A3 portfolio. Overall, the company's performance in Q2 reflects strong year-over-year results across segments and regions, with a focus on meeting financial commitments and capitalizing on momentum. The company is also making the right investment decisions for the long-term. The financial outlook and additional details were expected to be provided by Cathie Lesjak.
