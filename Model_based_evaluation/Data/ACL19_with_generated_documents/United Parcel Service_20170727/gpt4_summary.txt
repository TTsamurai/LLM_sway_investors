**Overview of Q2 Financial Performance:**
- **Revenue Growth**: In Q2, total revenue increased by 7.7%. After adjusting for currency fluctuations, growth was approximately 9%. Growth was uniform across all segments with shipment growth across the product portfolio.
- **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: EPS for the quarter was $1.58, marking an 11% increase from the previous year. This growth was driven by core performance improvements and several beneficial items, notably related to net fuel year-over-year, workers' compensation cost reductions, and a one-time benefit in the Supply Chain & Freight segment.
- **Operating Profit**: Increased by 13% to $1.4 billion with margin expansion of 60 basis points to 14.3%.

**Segment Performance:**
- **U.S. Domestic**: Revenue increased over 8% influenced by volume growth, the timing of Easter, and higher fuel surcharges. Ground shipments rose by more than 4%, whereas Deferred Air and Next Day Air saw increases of 11% and over 6%, respectively.
- **International**: Adjusted for currency, revenue grew by 8.3%, and operating profit expanded nearly 14% to $697 million. This was driven by strong demand in export solutions, especially from Europe and Asia-to-U.S. trade lanes.
- **Supply Chain & Freight**: This segment saw a 12% increase in revenue and a 24% improvement in operating profit. Key contributors included gains in forwarding tonnage and UPS freight revenue, which benefited from strong LTL tonnage gains.
