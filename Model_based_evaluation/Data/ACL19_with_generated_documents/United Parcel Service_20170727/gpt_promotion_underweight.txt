Thank you for providing the transcript. Based on the information provided in the earnings call, here are some key reasons to recommend an 'underweight' investment stance:

1. The company's revenue growth was largely driven by one-time benefits such as lower fuel costs and workers' compensation adjustments. It is important to note that these one-time benefits may not be sustainable in the long term, leading to potential challenges in maintaining revenue growth.

2. The company's guidance for the third quarter suggests flat earnings per share compared to the previous year. This could indicate a potential slowdown in growth and profitability.

3. There are external factors, such as store closures impacting business-to-business growth, that could have a negative impact on the company's performance going forward.

4. The shift in the company's pension plan to a pay-as-you-go 401(k)-style plan could potentially have long-term financial implications and increase uncertainty for future liabilities.

5. The company's large capital expenditures for building new facilities might not generate the expected returns, especially if there is a decline in e-commerce or changes in consumer behavior.

6. The company's hedging strategy for currency fluctuations might not fully mitigate the impact of currency headwinds on financial performance.

Based on these reasons, it is recommended to take an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. It is important for investors to evaluate the sustainability and long-term prospects of the company given the factors mentioned above.
