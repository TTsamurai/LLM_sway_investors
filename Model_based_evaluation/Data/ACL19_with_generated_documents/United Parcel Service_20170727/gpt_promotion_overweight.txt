Based on the recent earnings call, it is recommended to take an 'overweight' investment stance on the company. The company's growth and progress in the second quarter are indicative of positive future performance. Total revenue increased by 7.7% and adjusted for currency, top line growth was nearly 9%. Earnings per share also showed substantial growth, up almost 11% over the last year, with good core performance within the segments. Several items positively contributed to the quarter including a benefit from net fuel year-over-year, lower workers' compensation costs, and a one-time benefit in the Supply Chain & Freight segment.

The company has shown balanced revenue across all segments with good shipment growth, and improvements in operating profit and margin. Looking at the International segment, there was good top line growth with positive operating leverage on a currency-neutral basis. The Supply Chain & Freight segment produced another solid quarter of financial results with revenue up 12% and reported operating profit improving by 24%.

Cash flow has also been strong, with the company focusing on building a smart logistics network, creating flexibility through a strong balance sheet, and distributing returns to shareholders. Even with the currency headwinds, the International business still maintains an industry-leading margin of 18.4%.

Overall, the company is on track to achieve its goals and has a proven strategy and operational flexibility that has provided the targeted financial results expected. The company is investing aggressively, implementing new operations, and acquiring new capabilities. With a strong track record, the company is well-positioned for growth.

It is important to note that the company has announced changes to its non-union U.S. pension, which stabilizes its risk obligation and lowers the liability on its balance sheet. Additionally, the company is investing in building new facilities to support its growth and is on track to achieve the goals set out in its investor conference presentations.

In conclusion, the company's recent earnings call indicates that it is well-positioned for further growth and offers a compelling case for an 'overweight' investment stance. The company's performance in the second quarter and its strategic initiatives provide confidence in its future prospects.
