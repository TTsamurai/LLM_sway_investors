Based on the recent earnings call for Walmart, there are a few key points that lead to a cautious or skeptical perspective on the company. Firstly, while there was a strong quarter with broad-based growth, the gross profit margin declined, largely due to price investments and mix effects of eCommerce. Additionally, the company experienced a significant impact from recent hurricanes, leading to a decline in gross profit margin.

The company's adjusted EPS was $1, excluding certain charges. This implies that the company's actual earnings may not be as strong as initially reported. Furthermore, the company's guidance for the fourth quarter implies more difficult compares and potential challenges ahead.

The company is also investing heavily in online grocery pick-up and associate delivery tests, which may lead to increased costs and operational challenges. Additionally, the partnerships with brands like Lord & Taylor and the acquisition of brands like Bonobos raise questions about the company's long-term strategy and the impact on profitability.

Finally, while the company reported strong sales growth, the details of the customer base and the impact of pricing strategies on customer behavior were not fully disclosed. This lack of transparency raises concerns about the sustainability of the sales growth and the company's ability to retain and attract customers in the long term.

In conclusion, based on the above concerns and uncertainties, we recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on Walmart, as the company may face challenges in maintaining its growth momentum and managing its expenses effectively in the coming quarters.
