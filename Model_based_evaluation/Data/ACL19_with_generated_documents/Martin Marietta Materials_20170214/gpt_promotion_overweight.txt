. Thank you, Anne and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. I am excited about the performance of Martin Marietta and the potential for growth in 2017 and beyond. Based on the information provided in this call, I believe that Martin Marietta is well-positioned for continued success and growth. I recommend an 'overweight' investment stance based on the company's recent performance. Thank you for your time and I look forward to discussing our first quarter results with you in May.
