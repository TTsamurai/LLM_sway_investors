Thank you for your interest in our earnings call. We appreciate your questions and will now walk through some key points from the call. To start, it's important to note that we delivered a record-setting year in 2016, achieving strong results characterized by setting records in each consecutive quarter of 2016 and for the full year.

We've strategically positioned our assets in many of the nation's fastest-growing regions, and we have consistently achieved pricing gains for our valuable products. Our relentless focus on cost containment has also contributed to our strong performance throughout the slow and steady economic recovery. We are confident that our successful execution of this strategic approach will continue to generate top and bottom-line growth and enhance shareholder value in 2017 and beyond.

We also confirmed that we are well-prepared for the potential benefits that may come from potential legislation for increasing federal infrastructure investment. As for our projections for 2017, we expect a broad end-user-driven effort to develop and implement new federal transportation tax and revenue reform and investment package, with a focus on substantial long-term investment in infrastructure.

In terms of our capital allocation priorities, we continue to invest in acquisitions, enhancing our market positions in accordance with our strategic objectives. We have focused on acquisitions that align with our goal to maintain leading market positions in high-growth corridors, and we feel confident in the opportunities for growth in 2017 and beyond.

We will continue to focus on the operations and best practices needed to sustain Martin Marietta as a premier aggregates company and continue our transformation into one of the world's best companies. We look forward to discussing our first-quarter results with you in May. Thank you for your time and continued support of Martin Marietta.
