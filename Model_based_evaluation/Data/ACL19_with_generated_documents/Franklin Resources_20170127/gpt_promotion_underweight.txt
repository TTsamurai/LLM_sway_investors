In my analysis of the company's recent earnings call, I find several points of concern that lead me to recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company. Firstly, the company continues to experience outflows, despite improved performance against peers and benchmarks. This indicates a lack of investor confidence in the company's ability to generate returns.

Additionally, the discussion on the potential delay or repeal of the fiduciary rule suggests uncertainty in the regulatory environment, which could impact the company's business model. The mixed opinions and lack of consensus on the impact of the rule on advisory models adds to the uncertainty surrounding the company's future outlook.

The focus on improving performance in global bond funds, while important, is also a cause for concern. Although the company has demonstrated effective cost management and dividend increases, the reliance on global bond funds in a changing market environment may not provide the stability and growth potential that investors seek.

The discussion on the effect of fee rate decline and the potential impact on expenses also raises red flags. A gradual pressure on effective fee rates, along with seasonally depressed expenses, suggests challenges in maintaining profitability.

Furthermore, the emphasis on developing lower volatility funds and the need for larger wins to offset potential declines in assets under management raises questions about the company's ability to attract and retain investors in a changing market landscape.

In conclusion, based on the cautious and uncertain outlook presented in the recent earnings call, I recommend an 'underweight' investment stance on the company until there is more clarity on its ability to address the challenges and uncertainties in its business environment.
