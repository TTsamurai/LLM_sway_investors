Based on the recent earnings conference call transcripts, the following key financial metrics and insights can be highlighted:

1. Investment Performance: The company has shown improved performance against peers and benchmarks this quarter, despite experiencing outflows.

2. Cost Management: The company has effectively managed costs and increased annual dividends and share repurchases, which offset compensation-related equity issuance in the first quarter.

3. Fiduciary Rule: The consensus view suggests a 6 to 12 month delay in the implementation of the fiduciary rule. There is uncertainty about potential repeal or replacement of the rule, which is impacting how advisor models are being prepared.

4. Global Bond Fund Performance: Despite good relative performance, the global bond fund experienced higher outflows, but there are signs of improvement.

5. Active Investing Optimism: The company remains optimistic about active investing due to the trend of less correlation and less central bank risk-on/off in the market.

6. Potential Repatriation: The company is optimistic about the possibility of a repatriation holiday, which may lead to an increase in funds that can be brought back and potentially used for mergers and acquisitions (M&A).

7. Business Strategy: The company plans to focus on increasing exposure to the emerging market debt (ED) category, building a digital strategy, and investing in advertising to reach more advisors in a cost-efficient manner.

8. Impact on Fee Rates: There is a gradual decline in effective fee rates due to changes in product mix, variations in retail and institutional mix, and pressure on fees.

9. Expenses Management: The company expects expenses to be down around 2% year-over-year, with seasonal fluctuations in advertising and professional fees.

10. Changes in Asset Under Management (AUM): The mix of earnings in US and non-US funds is increasing, leading to an increase in US cash flow, which supports the continued share repurchase activity.

Overall, the company remains focused on active investing, effective cost management, potential changes in regulations, and expansion of their business strategy to adapt to market conditions and drive growth. Their performance against peers and their approach to addressing challenges in the market will be important to monitor in the future.
