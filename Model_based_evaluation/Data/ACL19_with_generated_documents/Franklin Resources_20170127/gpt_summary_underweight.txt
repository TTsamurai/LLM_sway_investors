Key Financial Metrics: 

1. Investment performance against peers and benchmarks improved significantly this quarter. 
2. Effective cost management demonstrated by extended track record of annual dividend increases and share repurchases offset compensation-related equity issuance in the first quarter. 
3. Outflows were experienced, particularly in global bond flows despite good relative performance.
4. Performance of the six largest funds, with every one in the top quartile for the 12-month period and 15 of the 20 largest funds in the top quartile.
5. Pressure on effective fee rates, leading to a gradual decline in the effective fee rate over the years.
6. Seasonal fluctuations in G&A expenses, such as advertising and professional fees.
7. Mix of earnings favoring US cash flow and increasing mix of US and non-US earnings.
8. Continued commitment to share repurchase activity as part of growth strategy.
9. Investments made in various areas such as private equity, real estate, and traditional alternatives. 

Based on the discussion in the earnings conference call transcript, adopting an 'underweight' investment stance would be advisable due to the headwinds in global bond flows, pressure on effective fee rates, and the potential impact of the fiduciary rule on the advisor side. The mix of earnings and the seasonally fluctuating expenses also suggest a cautious approach. Furthermore, the uncertainty surrounding the fiduciary rule and potential delays in implementation may lead to continued outflows, making the investment outlook unfavorable.
