's continued collective effort. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to your continued interest in Verizon. With that, we conclude our earnings call. Thank you."

Based on the information provided in the earnings call transcript, my analysis and future outlook for Verizon is as follows:

1. Network Performance: The company's focus on providing the best network experience and their leadership in the 4G LTE space is a positive sign. They have invested in advancing their network and have shown resilience during natural disasters, demonstrating a strong network performance.

2. Revenue and Profitability: While wireless operating revenue declined in the third quarter, there are indications of improving service revenue trends, particularly with the transition to unsubsidized pricing. Equipment revenue has shown an increase due to higher device payment plan take rates.

3. EBITDA Margin: The wireless EBITDA margin has shown improvement and is expected to partially offset seasonal volume, advertising expenses, and promotional activity in the fourth quarter.

4. Wireline Business: The wireline business has seen mixed results, with growth in fiber-based products partially offset by declines in legacy copper products. The enterprise solutions have seen some decline, but wireless EBITDA margins have improved.

5. New Businesses: The integration of Oath and the growth of Telematics and IoT revenue show potential for future growth.

6. Strategy for Future Growth: The company is confident in its strategy to drive future growth, with a focus on customer relationships, digital media expansion, and innovation in technological applications, particularly in the 5G space.

7. CapEx and 5G Deployment: The company is pre-positioning for 5G deployment, but the timeline for mobile 5G deployment is not expected in 2018. Continued investment in fiber and network capabilities is anticipated in preparation for 5G.

Based on this analysis, it is recommended to adopt an 'underweight' investment stance for Verizon due to a potential decline in service revenue, ongoing challenges in the wireline business, and the uncertain timeline for 5G deployment. Additionally, the competitive landscape in the wireless industry and potential regulatory changes should also be considered in formulating the investment stance.
