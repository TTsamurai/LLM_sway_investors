's strong capabilities in delivering results. I would now like to open the call for questions. Thank you.

Summary report:
Verizon reported solid operational and financial performance in a competitive environment. The wireless segment delivered strong operational performance, with revenue declining slightly but expected to improve in the fourth quarter. The company is confident in its strategy to drive future growth and remains committed to investing in its networks. The wireline segment also showed growth in fiber-based products and a steady decline in legacy copper products. The company's new businesses, including media and Telematics, are making progress and contributing to revenue. The company is also focused on driving profitability through cost and capital efficiencies across its business.

However, despite the positive aspects of the earnings call, we still adopt an 'underweight' investment stance due to several financial metrics that suggest potential challenges for the company. These include declining wireless operating revenue, margin pressures, and ongoing consumer video headwinds in the wireline segment. Additionally, the company's high level of total debt may present potential risks in the future.

Overall, while Verizon is making progress in its strategic initiatives, the financial metrics indicate potential challenges that warrant an 'underweight' investment stance. It's important for investors to monitor the company's performance closely and consider the potential risks associated with its financial metrics.
